    "caption_full": "The left diagram schematically shows how a neutron two-point correlation function can be constructed from three copies of a single quark propagator. Calculations of three-point functions including operator insertions are typically more expensive because they require multiple quark propagator calculations, but using the construction schematically depicted on the right, MEs can be constructed from the same quark propagator used to construct the neutron two-point function. The quark propagator source point is taken to be the operator insertion point (black dot) and extends forward in time to a neutron annihilation operator or backward in time to an anitneutron creation operator.",

The quantities are defined in Ref. . This investigation indicates a large ( -level) nuclear effect for scalar interactions, which if it persists at physical values of the quark masses, can have a significant effect in MEs of scalar currents in large isotopes (a large quenching can be a possibility considering the quenching of the axial charge in such isotopes ). Reliable theory input for scalar nuclear MEs will be crucial to interpret experimental searches in terms of the popular scalar portal scenarios. As is seen in the right panel (courtesy of Kaixuan Ni), the remaining not-yet-excluded region of the WIMP mass given the cross-section sensitivity of experiments will be considerably reduced in upcoming years, and reliable interpretation of the outcome of these searches will depend upon controlled nuclear MEs.",
