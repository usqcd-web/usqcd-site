      "summary": "We apply heavy-quark effective theory (HQET) to separate long- and short-distance effects of heavy quarks in lattice gauge theory. In this paper we focus on flavor-changing currents that mediate transitions from one heavy flavor to another. We stress differences in the formalism for heavy-light currents, which are discussed in a companion paper, showing how HQET provides a systematic matching procedure. We obtain one-loop results for the matching factors of lattice currents, needed for heavy-quark phenomenology, such as the calculation of zero-recoil form factors for the semileptonic decays $B\\to D^{(*)}lν$. Results for the Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie scale $q^*$ are also given.",

      "summary": "We apply heavy-quark effective theory to separate long- and short-distance effects of heavy quarks in lattice gauge theory. In this approach, the inverse heavy-quark mass and the lattice spacing are treated as short distances, and their effects are lumped into short-distance coefficients. We show how to use this formalism to match lattice gauge theory to continuum QCD, order by order in the heavy-quark expansion. In this paper, we focus on heavy-light currents. In particular, we obtain one-loop results for the matching factors of lattice currents, needed for heavy-quark phenomenology, such as the calculation of heavy-light decay constants, and heavy-to-light transition form factors.

Quarks with three values of lattice masses, 210, 124 and 80 MeV, are formulated on the lattice using the standard Wilson approach. At every mass, 100 gluon configurations on 16^3 x 32 lattice with β=6.0 are used for statistical averaging. The results are compared with the previous calculations with momentum extrapolation. The contribution of the disconnected diagrams is studied at the largest quark mass using noise theory technique.",

Our algorithm uses a quenched gauge field update with a shifted gauge coupling to minimize fluctuations in the trace log of the Wilson Dirac matrix. The details of tuning the gauge coupling shift as well as results for the distribution of noisy estimators in our implementation are given. We present data for some basic observables from the noisy method, as well as acceptance rate information and discuss potential autocorrelation and sign violation effects.

The mass of the lowest-lying negative-parity $J = 1/2^{-}$ state is computed in quenched lattice QCD using an ${\\cal O}(a)$-improved clover fermion action, and a splitting found with the nucleon mass. The calculation is performed on two lattice volumes, and three lattice spacings enabling a study of both finite-volume and finite-lattice-spacing uncertainties. A measurement of the first excited radial excitation of the nucleon finds a mass considerably larger than that of the negative-parity ground state, in accord with other lattice determinations but in disagreement with experiment. Results are also presented for the lightest negative-parity $I=3/2$ state.",

      "summary": "The numerical simulation of various field theories at non-zero chemical potential suffers from severe complex action problems. In particular, QCD at non-zero quark density can presently not be simulated for that reason. A similar complex action problem arises in the 2-d O(3) model -- a toy model for QCD. Here we construct the 2-d O(3) model at non-zero density via dimensional reduction of an antiferromagnetic quantum spin ladder in a magnetic field. The complex action problem of the 2-d O(3) model manifests itself as a sign problem of the ladder system. This sign problem is solved completely with a meron-cluster algorithm.",

      "summary": "Using clover improved Wilson fermions we calculate thermal vector meson correlation functions above the deconfinement phase transition of quenched QCD. At temperatures 1.5 Tc and 3Tc they are found to differ by less than 15% from that of a freely propagating quark anti-quark pair. This puts severe constraints on the dilepton production rate and in particular rules out a strong divergence of the dilepton rate at low energies. The vector spectral function, which has been reconstructed using the Maximum Entropy Method, yields an enhancement of the dilepton rate over the Born rate of at most a factor two in the energy interval 4 < E/T < 8 and suggests that the spectrum is cut-off at low energies by a thermal mass threshold of about (2-3)T.",

This is the main theoretical ingredient needed to determine |V(cb)| from the exclusive decay anti-B --> D* lepton anti-neutrino. We introduce three ratios, in which most of statistical and systematic error cancels, making a precise calculation possible. We fit the heavy-quark mass dependence directly, and extract the 1/m_Q^2 and three of the four 1/m_Q^3 corrections in the heavy-quark expansion. In this paper we show how the method works in the quenched approximation, obtaining F(1) = 0.913 (+0.024-0.017)(+/-0.016)(+0.003-0.014)(+0.000-0.016)(+0.006-0.014) where the uncertainties come, respectively, from statistics and fitting, matching lattice gauge theory to QCD, lattice spacing dependence, light quark mass effects, and the quenched approximation. We also discuss how to reduce these uncertainties and, thus, to obtain a model-independent determination of |V(cb)|.",

      "summary": "We report the results of a calculation of the K --> pi pi matrix elements relevant for the $\\DIhalf$ rule and $\\epe$ in quenched lattice QCD using domain wall fermions at a fixed lattice spacing $a^{-1} \\sim 2$ GeV. Working in the three-quark effective theory, where only the u, d and s quarks enter and which is known perturbatively to next-to-leading order, we calculate the lattice K --> pi and K --> |0> matrix elements of dimension six, four-fermion operators. Through lowest order chiral perturbation theory these yield K --> pi pi matrix elements, which we then normalize to continuum values through a non-perturbative renormalization technique. For the ratio of isospin amplitudes |A_0|/|A_2| we find a value of $25.3 \\pm 1.8$ (statistical error only) compared to the experimental value of 22.2, with individual isospin amplitudes 10-20% below the experimental values. For $\\epe$, using known central values for standard model parameters, we calculate $(-4.0 \\pm 2.3) \\times 10^{-4}$ (statistical error only) compared to the current experimental average of $(17.2 \\pm 1.8) \\times 10^{-4}$. Because we find a large cancellation between the I = 0 and I = 2 contributions to $\\epe$, the result may be very sensitive to the approximations employed. Among these are the use of: quenched QCD, lowest order chiral perturbation theory and continuum perturbation theory below 1.3 GeV. We have also calculated the kaon B parameter, B_K and find $B_{K,\\bar{MS}}(2 {\\rm GeV}) = 0.532(11)$. Although currently unable to give a reliable systematic error, we have control over statistical errors and more simulations will yield information about the effects of the approximations on this first-principles determination of these important quantities.",

The improved staggered action leads to a dispersion relation with diminished lattice artifacts, and hence better thermodynamic properties. It decreases the flavor symmetry breaking of staggered quarks substantially, and we estimate that at the transition temperature for an $N_t=8$ to $N_t=10$ lattice {\\em all} pions will be lighter than the lightest kaon.

A simple linear extrapolation of $\\Ga$ to the chiral limit yielded a value that was almost a factor of two smaller than the experimental one. Here we report our recent study of this issue. In particular, we investigate possible errors arising from finite lattice volume, especially in the lighter quark mass region. We employ a RG-improved gauge action (DBW2), which maintains very good chiral behavior even on a coarse lattice ($a^{-1}\\simeq$ 1.3 GeV), in order to perform simulations at large physical volume ($> (2{\\rm fm})^3$). Our preliminary results suggest that the finite volume effect is significant.",

The implications of previous results using the local chirality histogram method are discussed, and the new results using the overlap Dirac operator in Wilson gauge backgrounds at lattice spacings ranging from a~0.04 fm to a~0.12 fm are reported. While the degree of local chirality does not change appreciably closer to the continuum limit, we find that the size and density of local structures responsible for chiral peaking do change significantly. The resulting values are in disagreement with the assumptions of the Instanton Liquid Model. We conclude that the fluctuations of topological charge in the QCD vacuum are not locally quantized.",

We use an order $α_s^2 a^2, a^4$ Symanzik improved gauge action and an order $α_s a^2, a^4$ improved staggered quark action. The improved staggered action leads to a dispersion relation with diminished lattice artifacts, and hence better thermodynamic properties. It decreases the flavor symmetry breaking of staggered quarks substantially, and we estimate that at the transition temperature for an $N_t=8$ to $N_t=10$ lattice {\\em all} pions will be lighter than the lightest kaon.

      "summary": "A new extension of the attractive Hubbard model is constructed to study the critical behavior near a finite temperature superconducting phase transition in two dimensions using the recently developed meron-cluster algorithm. Unlike previous calculations in the attractive Hubbard model which were limited to small lattices, the new algorithm is used to study the critical behavior on lattices as large as $128\\times 128$. These precise results for the first time show that a fermionic system can undergo a finite temperature phase transition whose critical behavior is well described by the predictions of Kosterlitz and Thouless almost three decades ago. In particular it is confirmed that the spatial winding number susceptibility obeys the well known predictions of finite size scaling for $T<T_c$ and up to logarithmic corrections the pair susceptibility scales as $L^{2-η}$ at large volumes with $0\\leqη\\leq 0.25$ for $0\\leq T\\leq T_c$.",

It is found that the energy density is insensitive to spontaneous symmetry breaking effects along a special direction in the complex plane. In particular, in the case of vector-like gauge theories such as QCD, the change in energy generated by coupling to pure-gluonic parity-odd operators is always a growing function of the external fields along the real axis, independent of the mode in which symmetry is realized. In light of this, although there is little doubt that parity is not spontaneously broken in massive QCD, the validity of the Vafa and Witten proof is, however, questionable.",

      "summary": "We study the two-dimensional Wess-Zumino model with extended N=2 supersymmetry on the lattice. The lattice prescription we choose has the merit of preserving {\\it exactly} a single supersymmetric invariance at finite lattice spacing $a$. Furthermore, we construct three other transformations of the lattice fields under which the variation of the lattice action vanishes to $O(ga^2)$ where $g$ is a typical interaction coupling. These four transformations correspond to the two Majorana supercharges of the continuum theory. We also derive lattice Ward identities corresponding to these exact and approximate symmetries. We use dynamical fermion simulations to check the equality of the massgaps in the boson and fermion sectors and to check the lattice Ward identities. At least for weak coupling we see no problems associated with a lack of reflection positivity in the lattice action and find good agreement with theory. At strong coupling we provide evidence that problems associated with a lack of reflection positivity are evaded for small enough lattice spacing.",

We elucidate the role of the zero modes in the meson propagators, particularly that of the pseudoscalar meson. The non-perturbative renormalization constant $Z_A$ is determined from the axial Ward identity and is found to be almost independent of the quark mass for the range of quark masses we study; this implies that the $O(a^2)$ error is small. The pion decay constant, $f_π$, is calculated from which we determine the lattice spacing to be 0.148 fm. We look for quenched chiral log in the pseudoscalar decay constants and the pseudoscalar masses and we find clear evidence for its presence. The chiral log parameter $δ$ is determined to be in the range 0.15 -- 0.4 which is consistent with that predicted from quenched chiral perturbation theory.",

We further show that in another representative the Tomboulis σ- ηthin vortices are P (projection) vortices. The projection approximation corresponds to dropping the perimeter factor of a Wilson loop after appropriate gauge fixing. We present results for static quark potentials based on these vortex counters and compare pojection vortex counters with gauge invariant ones on the same configuration.",

      "title": "Partially quenched chiral perturbation theory without $Φ_0$",
      "summary": "This paper completes the argument that lattice simulations of partially quenched QCD can provide quantitative information about QCD itself, with the aid of partially quenched chiral perturbation theory. A barrier to doing this has been the inclusion of $Φ_0$, the partially quenched generalization of the $η'$, in previous calculations in the partially quenched effective theory. This invalidates the low energy perturbative expansion, gives rise to many new unknown parameters, and makes it impossible to reliably calculate the relation between the partially quenched theory and low energy QCD. We show that it is straightforward and natural to formulate partially quenched chiral perturbation theory without $Φ_0$, and that the resulting theory contains the effective theory for QCD without the $η'$. We also show that previous results, obtained including $Φ_0$, can be reinterpreted as applying to the theory without $Φ_0$. We contrast the situation with that in the quenched effective theory, where we explain why it is necessary to include $Φ_0$.\n We also compare the derivation of chiral perturbation theory in partially quenched QCD with the standard derivation in unquenched QCD. We find that the former cannot be justified as rigorously as the latter, because of the absence of a physical Hilbert space. Finally, we present an encouraging result: unphysical double poles in certain correlation functions in partially quenched chiral perturbation theory can be shown to be a property of the underlying theory, given only the symmetries and some plausible assumptions.",

In this paper, we focus on the small nonzero eigenvalues in an SU(2) gauge field background at $β=2.4$ and $N_T=4$. This low-lying spectrum is computed on four different spatial lattices ($12^3$, $14^3$, $16^3$, and $18^3$).

      "summary": "Staggered fermions with smeared links can have greatly improved chiral properties. In a recent paper we introduced a simple and effective method to simulate four flavors of staggered smeared link fermions. In this work we extend the four flavor method to two flavors. We define the two flavor action by the square root of the four flavor fermionic determinant and show that by using a polynomial approximation the two flavor action can be evaluated with the necessary accuracy. We test this method by studying the finite temperature phase structure with hypercubic smeared (HYP) link staggered action on N_t=4 temporal lattices.",

      "summary": "Many non-Hermitian but PT-symmetric theories are known to have a real positive spectrum. Since the action is complex for there theories, Monte Carlo methods do not apply. In this paper the first field-theoretic method for numerical simulations of PT-symmetric Hamiltonians is presented. The method is the complex Langevin equation, which has been used previously to study complex Hamiltonians in statistical physics and in Minkowski space. We compute the equal-time one-point and two-point Green's functions in zero and one dimension, where comparisons to known results can be made. The method should also be applicable in four-dimensional space-time. Our approach may also give insight into how to formulate a probabilistic interpretation of PT-symmetric theories.",

      "summary": "The scalar, isovector meson propagator is analyzed in quenched QCD, using the MQA pole-shifting ansatz to study the chiral limit. In addition to the expected short-range exponential falloff characteristic of a heavy scalar meson, the propagator also exhibits a longer-range, negative metric contribution which becomes pronounced for smaller quark masses. We show that this is a quenched chiral loop effect associated with the anomalous structure of the $η'$ propagator in quenched QCD. Both the time dependence and the quark mass dependence of this effect are well-described by a chiral loop diagram corresponding to an $η'- π$ intermediate state, which is light and effectively of negative norm in the quenched approximation. The relevant parameters of the effective Lagrangian describing the scalar sector of the quenched theory are determined.",

In many cases they show qualitative resemblence (typically at small values of the quark mass and distances larger than 0.4 fm) and they differ qualitatively at larger quark masses or at very short distance.

For the case of zero magnetic field we show that the model possesses three phases. For one of these the boundary length grows linearly with disk area, while the other two phases are characterized by a boundary whose size is on the order of the cut-off. A line of continuous magnetic transitions separates the two small boundary phases. We determine the critical exponents of the continuous magnetic phase transition and relate them to predictions from continuum 2-d quantum gravity. This line of continuous transitions appears to terminate on a line of discontinuous phase transitions dividing the small boundary phases from the large boundary phase. We examine the scaling of bulk magnetization and boundary magnetization as a function of boundary magnetic field in the vicinity of this tricritical point.",

      "summary": "The topological susceptibility is one of the few physical quantities that directly measure the properties of the QCD vacuum. Chiral perturbation theory predicts that in the small quark mass limit the topological susceptibility depends quadratically on the pion mass, approaching zero in the chiral limit. Lattice calculations have difficulty reproducing this behavior. In this paper we study the topological susceptibility on dynamical staggered fermion configurations. Our results indicate that the lattice spacing has to be small, around a~0.1fm for thin link staggered fermion actions to show the expected chiral behavior. Our preliminary result indicates that fat link fermions, on the other hand, reproduce the theoretical expectations even on lattices with a~0.17fm. We argue that this is due to the improved flavor symmetry of fat link fermionic actions.",

The chiral quark model provides the framework for the calculation of pseudoscalar meson (pi, K, ...) hadronic transitions among heavy-light excited and ground states. To calculate the excited states masses and wavefunctions, we must resort to a relativistic quark model. Our model includes the leading order corrections in 1/m_(c,b) (e.g. mixing). Numerical results for masses and light hadronic transition rates are compared to existing experimental data. The effective coupling of the chiral quark model can be determined by comparing with independent results from lattice simulations (g^8_A = 0.53 +-/- 0.11) or fitting to known widths (g^8_A = 0.82 +-/- 0.09).",

An irrelevant chiral 4-fermion interaction was added to the standard quark action to allow us to simulate at zero quark mass. Thermodynamics was studied on lattices of temporal extent 6. Clear evidence for a second order chiral transition was observed and the critical exponents $β_{mag}$, $δ$, $ν$ and $γ_{mag}$ were measured. These exponents did not agree with those expected by standard universality arguments. They were, however, consistent with tricritical behaviour. The $π$ and $σ$ screening masses were measured and showed clear evidence for chiral symmetry restoration at this transition.",

These simulations were done using a one-loop Symanzik improved gauge action and an improved Kogut-Susskind quark action. The lattice spacings, and hence also the physical volumes, were tuned to be the same in all the runs to better expose differences due to flavor number. Lattice spacings were tuned using the static quark potential, so as a byproduct we obtain updated results for the effect of sea quarks on the static quark potential. We find indications that the full QCD meson spectrum is in better agreement with experiment than the quenched spectrum. For the 0++ (a0) meson we see a coupling to two pseudoscalar mesons, or a meson decay on the lattice.",

Taking first a general action with nearest-neighbor and clover interactions, we study the mass dependence of the ratio of the hopping parameters, the clover coefficients, and an improvement coefficient for heavy-light vector and axial vector currents. We show how tree-level improvement can be achieved. For a particular choice of the spatial Wilson coupling, the results simplify, and $O(m_0a_τ)$ improvement is possible. (Here $m_0$ is the bare quark mass and $a_τ$ the temporal lattice spacing.)

      "summary": "Recent experimental observations of CP asymmetry in B0 -> psi K0 constitute the first significant signal of CP violation outside the neutral kaon system; thus they represent an important milestone to test the CKM paradigm. We, therefore, undertake a critical appraisal of the existing experimental and theoretical inputs used to deduce constraints on sin(2 beta) and other important parameters and thus find, in particular, sin(2 beta) > 0.50 at 95% CL which is completely compatible with the combined experimental result: sin(2 beta) = 0.46 +- 0.17, representing an important success of the CKM model of CP violation. Searches for new physics in B decays to psi+K0 like final states will require improved precision; we make some suggestions to facilitate these. We also present a global fit including the new CP asymmetry measurements in B->psi+K0 as an additional input yielding e.g. gamma =29-56 degrees, eta-bar = >.19-.36, rho-bar=.15-.37, Jcp=(1.8 - 3.0) X 10^(-5), $Br(K+ -> pi+ nu nu-bar)=(0.51 - 0.90) X 10^(-10) and Br(KL -> pi0 nu nu-bar) = (0.11 - 0.31) X 10^(-10) at 95% CL.",

Furthermore, the approach can be applied to calculate the mass of glueball states (ground or excited states) with any spin $J$ including $J\\geq 4$. Under the quenched approximation, we present pre-calculation results for the masses of $0^{++}$ state and $2^{++}$ state, which are $1754(85)(86)MeV$ and $2417(56)(117)MeV$, respectively.",

      "summary": "The separation of a heavy quark and antiquark pair leads to the formation of a tube of flux, or \"string\", which should break in the presence of light quark-antiquark pairs. This expected zero-temperature phenomenon has proven elusive in simulations of lattice QCD. We study mixing between the string state and the two-meson decay channel in QCD with two flavors of dynamical sea quarks. We confirm that mixing is weak and find that it decreases at level crossing. While our study does not show direct effects of internal quark loops, our results, combined with unitarity, give clear confirmation of string breaking.",

Our results are from a quenched simulation, on a 16^3x32 lattice, with beta=6.0 and an extent in the fifth dimension of 16. We also discuss the expected effects of the residual chiral symmetry breaking inherent in a domain wall fermion simulation with a finite fifth dimension, and study the evidence for both explicit and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking effects in our numerical results. We find that the relations between different renormalisation factors predicted by chiral symmetry are, to a good approximation, satisfied by our results and that systematic effects due to the (low energy) spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and zero-modes can be controlled. Our results are compared against the perturbative predictions for both their absolute value and renormalisation scale dependence.",

Moreover, the space-time chiral structure of these eigenmodes reflects the space-time topological structure of the underlying gauge field. We present evidence from lattice QCD on the local chiral structure of low Dirac eigenmodes leading to the conclusion that topological charge fluctuations of the QCD vacuum are not instanton-dominated. The result supports Witten's arguments that topological charge is produced by confinement-related gauge fluctuations rather than instantons.",

      "summary": "We present a lattice QCD calculation of the form factors and differential decay rates for semileptonic decays of the heavy-light mesons $B$ and $D$ to the final state $πlν$. The results are obtained with three methodological improvements over previous lattice calculations: a matching procedure that reduces heavy-quark lattice artifacts, the first study of lattice-spacing dependence, and the introduction of kinematic cuts to reduce model dependence. We show that the main systematics are controllable (within the quenched approximation) and outline how the calculations could be improved to aid current experiments in the determination of~$|V_{ub}|$ and~$|V_{cd}|$.",
