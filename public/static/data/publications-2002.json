      "title": "Direct simulations of small multi-fermion systems",
      "summary": "I explore computer simulations of the dynamics of small multi-fermion lattice systems. The method is more general, but I concentrate on Hubbard type models where the fermions hop between a small number of connected sites. I use the natural mapping of fermion occupation numbers onto computer bits. Signs from fermion interchange are reduced to bit counting. The technique inherently requires computer resources growing exponentially with the system volume; so, it restricted to modestly small systems. Large volume results would require combining these techniques with further approximations, perhaps in a recursive renormalization group manner.",

      "summary": "Recently, we have pointed out that sign-coherent 4-dimensional structures can not dominate topological charge fluctuations in QCD vacuum at all scales. Here we show that an enhanced lower-dimensional coherence is possible. In pure SU(3) lattice gauge theory we find that in a typical equilibrium configuration about 80% of space-time points are covered by two oppositely-charged connected structures built of elementary 3-dimensional coherent hypercubes. The hypercubes within the structure are connected through 2-dimensional common faces. We suggest that this coherence is a manifestation of a low-dimensional order present in the QCD vacuum. The use of a topological charge density associated with Ginsparg-Wilson fermions (\"chiral smoothing\") is crucial for observing this structure.",

We demonstrate that the residual chiral symmetry breaking, which is present for a finite number of lattice sites in the fifth dimension ($L_s$), can be substantially suppressed using improved gauge actions. In particular the Symanzik action, the Iwasaki action, and a renormalization group improved gauge action, called doubly blocked Wilson (DBW2), are studied and compared to the Wilson action. All improved gauge actions studied show a reduction in the additive residual quark mass, $\\mres$. Remarkably, in the DBW2 case $\\mres$ is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than the Wilson gauge action at $a^{-1}=2$ GeV and $L_s=16$. Significant reduction in $\\mres$ is also realized at stronger gauge coupling corresponding to $a^{-1}=1.3$ GeV. As our numerical investigation indicates, this reduction is achieved by reducing the number of topological lattice dislocations present in the gauge field configurations. We also present detailed results for the quenched light hadron spectrum and the pion decay constant using the DBW2 gauge action.",

      "summary": "We study the finite temperature phase transition of lattice QCD with an irrelevant chiral 4-fermion interaction and two massless quark flavours, on $8^3 \\times 4$ and $12^2 \\times 24 \\times 4$ lattices. The strength of the 4-fermion interaction was reduced to half the minimum value used in previous simulations, to study how the nature of this phase transition depends on this additional interaction. We find that the transition remains first order as the 4-fermion coupling is reduced. Extending our earlier studies indicates that for sufficiently large 4-fermion coupling, the transition is probably second order.",

      "summary": "One of the most serious problems of the staggered fermion lattice action is flavor symmetry violation. Smeared link staggered fermions can improve flavor symmetry by an order of magnitude relative to the standard thin link action. Over the last few years different smearing transformations have been proposed, both with perturbatively and non-perturbatively determined coefficients. What hindered the acceptance and more general use of smeared link fermions until now is the relative difficulty of dynamical simulations and the lack of perturbative calculations with these actions. In both areas there have been significant improvement lately, that I will review in this paper.",

Perturbative tests include calculations of the potential, flavor-changing quark scattering amplitudes, and matching factors for currents. Non-perturbative tests include the potential, measurements of flavor symmetry breaking for staggered fermions, the behavior of topological objects, and properties of overlap actions. Our results display the bad properties of these actions as well as their good ones.",

In particular, the plaquette, the static potential and the static self energy are calculated to this order for massive Wilson, Sheikholeslami-Wohlert and Kogut-Susskind fermions, including the mass and n_f dependence. The results can be used to obtain alpha_{MS} and m_b(m_b) from lattice simulations. We compare our perturbative calculations to simulation data of the static potential and report excellent qualitative agreement with boosted perturbation theory predictions for distances r<1/GeV. We are also able to resolve differences in the running of the coupling between n_f=2 and n_f=0 static potentials. We compute perturbative estimates of the ``beta-shifts'' of QCD with sea quarks, relative to the quenched theory, which we find to agree within 10 % with non-perturbative simulations. This is done by matching the respective static potentials at large distances. The prospects of determining the QCD running coupling from low energy hadron phenomenology in the near future are assessed. We obtain the result $Λ^{(2)}_{\\bar{MS}}r_0=0.69(15)$ for the two flavour QCD Lambda-parameter from presently available lattice data where $r_0^{-1}\\approx 400$ MeV and estimate $α_{\\bar{MS}}^{(5)}(m_Z)=0.1133(59)$.",

We consider the one pion loop renormalisation of the nucleon matrix elements of the corresponding operators and thereby develop formulae with which to extrapolate the moments of the unpolarised, helicity and transversity distributions. These formulae are consistent with chiral perturbation theory in the chiral limit and incorporate the correct heavy quark limits. In the polarised cases, the inclusion of intermediate states involving the $Δ$ isobar is found to be very important. The results of our extrapolations are in general agreement with the phenomenological values of these moments where they are known, and for the first time we perform an extrapolation of the low moments of the isovector transversity distribution which is consistent with chiral symmetry.",

The study of the chiral limit is facilitated by the pole-shifting ansatz of the modified quenched approximation. Pseudoscalar masses and decay constants are determined as a function of quark mass and quenched chiral log effects are estimated. A study of the flavor singlet eta prime hairpin diagram yields a precise determination of the eta prime mass insertion. The corresponding value of the quenched chiral log parameter delta is compared with the observed QCL effects. Removal of QCL effects from the scalar propagator allows a determination of the mass of the lowest lying isovector scalar $q\\bar{q}$ meson.",

Calculations have been extended to a second lattice spacing of about 0.09 fm. At this lattice spacing, there are results in the quenched approximation and for three sets of dynamical quark mass: m_l=m_s; m_l=0.4 m_s and m_l=0.2 m_s, where m_l is the light mass for the u and d quarks and m_s is the strange quark mass. At the coarser lattice spacing, for which results were presented at Lattice 2001, statistics have been increased for two sets of quark masses and three additional sets of quark masses have been studied, giving a total of eight combinations used to interpolate between the quenched and chiral limits. When these calculations are completed, we can study the decay constants taking into account both chiral and continuum extrapolations.",

We replace the usual linear chiral extrapolation with one that includes the logarithm that appears in chiral perturbation theory.

Simulations are being carried out on lattices with Nt=4, 6 and 8 for the case of three degenerate quarks with masses less than or equal to the strange quark mass, $m_s$, and on lattices with Nt=6 and 8 for degenerate up and down quarks with masses in the range 0.2 m_s \\leq m_{u,d} \\leq 0.6 m_s, and the strange quark fixed near its physical value. We also report on first computations of quark number susceptibilities with the Asqtad action. These susceptibilities are of interest because they can be related to event-by-event fluctuations in heavy ion collision experiments. Use of the improved quark action leads to a substantial reduction in lattice artifacts. This can be seen already for free fermions and carries over into our results for QCD.",

MILC data with three light dynamical flavors can be well fit by our formulas. However, two new chiral parameters, which describe order $a^2$ hairpin diagrams for taste-nonsinglet mesons, enter in the fits. To obtain precise results for the physical coefficients at order $p^4$, these new parameters will need to be bounded, at least roughly.",

      "summary": "We simulate lattice QCD at a finite chemical potential $μ_I$ for isospin ($I_3$) at zero and finite temperatures. At some $μ_I=μ_c$ QCD has a second order transition with mean-field critical exponents to a state where ($I_3$) is broken spontaneously by a charged pion condensate. Heating the system with $μ_I > μ_c$ we find there is some temperature at which this condensate evaporates. This transition appears to be second order and mean-field at lower $μ_I$ values, and first order for $μ_I$ sufficiently large. We are determining the dependence of the finite temperature crossover $T_c$ on $μ_I$ for $μ_I < μ_c$. This is expected to be identical to $T_c$'s dependence on quark-number chemical potential $μ_q$ for small $μ_q$.",

We use this representation of the theory to devise a non-local Metropolis algorithm to calculate the chiral susceptibility. For small lattices our algorithm reproduces exact results quite accurately. Applying this algorithm to large volumes yields rather surprising results. In particular we find $m_π\\neq 0$ for all $N$ and it increases with $N$. Since the talk was presented we have found reasons to believe that our algorithm breaks down for large volumes questioning the validity of our results.",

The calculation is done on quenched 16^3x28 lattices of a=0.2 fm using an improved gauge action and overlap fermions, with the pion mass as low as 180 MeV. The Roper state N(1440)1/2+ is clearly observed for the first time as the 1st-excited state of the nucleon from the standard interpolating field. Together with other baryons, our preliminary results indicate that the level-ordering of the low-lying baryon states on the lattice is largely consistent with experiment. The realization is helped by cross-overs between the excited 1/2+ and 1/2- states in the region of pion mass from 300 to 400 MeV.",

The calculation is done on a quenched lattice of size $16^3\\times 28$ and $a = 0.2$ fm with 80 configurations using overlap fermions and an improved gauge action. Using an improved constrained curve fitting technique, we find that the ground state pseudoscalar mass versus bare quark mass behavior is well controlled with small statistical errors; this permits a reliable fit of the quenched chiral log effects, a determination of the chiral log parameter ($δ= 0.26(3)$), and an estimate of the renormalized mass of the light quark ($m^{\\bar{MS}}(μ=2 {\\rm GeV}) = 3.7(3) {\\rm MeV}$).",

The resulting framework is used to demonstrate that the bulk of topological charge in QCD does not appear in the form of unit quantized lumps. This means that the mixing of \"would-be\" zeromodes associated with such lumps is probably not the prevalent microscopic mechanism for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. To characterize the coherent local behavior in topological charge density at low energy, we compute the charges contained in maximal coherent spheres enclosing non-overlapping peaks. We find a continuous distribution essentially ending at ~0.5. Finally, we study, for the first time, the overlap-operator topological-charge-density correlators and find consistency with non-positivity at nonzero physical distance. This represents a non-trivial check on the locality (in gauge paths) of the overlap Dirac operator for realistic gauge backgrounds.",

      "summary": "We explore the quark-mass dependence of two-nucleon systems. Allowed regions for the scattering lengths in the 1S0 and 3S1 channels as functions of the light-quark masses are determined from the current uncertainty in strong-interaction parameters that appear at next-to-leading order in the effective field theory. Where experimental constraints are absent, as is the case for the quark-mass dependent four-nucleon operators, we use naive dimensional analysis. We find it likely that there is no bound state in the 1S0 channel in the chiral limit. However, given the present uncertainties in strong-interaction parameters it is unclear whether the deuteron is bound or unbound in the chiral limit.",

On quenched isotropic lattices with lattice spacings between 0.02 and 0.05 fm, bar{q} q systems with quark masses close to the charm mass and with different spin-parity quantum numbers are studied in the temperature range 0.9 Tc - 3 Tc. Results for temporal correlators of local operators, and the spectral functions constructed from them, are discussed. For the pseudoscalar and vector channels, the correlators are observed to change very little across the deconfinement transition, unlike in the case of the light quarks.",

When the up and down quark masses are much smaller than the strange-quark mass the chiral extrapolation of strange-quark matrix elements in the nucleon from the lattice up and down quark masses to their physical values can be performed with two-flavor chiral perturbation theory, thereby avoiding the slow convergence problem of the three-flavor chiral expansion. We explore the chiral expansion of several matrix elements of strange operators in the nucleon in two-flavor chiral perturbation theory and two-flavor partial-quenched chiral perturbation theory.",

On the shortest length scale, the excitations are consistent with states created by local gluon field operators arising from a multipole operator product expansion. An intermediate crossover region below 2 fm is identified with a dramatic rearrangement of the level orderings. On the largest length scale of 2-3 fm, the spectrum agrees with that expected for string-like excitations. The energies nearly reproduce asymptotic pi/R string gaps, but exhibit a fine structure, providing important clues for developing an effective bosonic string description.",

      "summary": "We present results for $f_B$, $f_{B_s}$, $f_D$, $f_{D_s}$ and their ratios in the presence of two flavors of light sea quarks ($N_f=2$). We use Wilson light valence quarks and Wilson and static heavy valence quarks; the sea quarks are simulated with staggered fermions. Additional quenched simulations with nonperturbatively improved clover fermions allow us to improve our control of the continuum extrapolation. For our central values the masses of the sea quarks are not extrapolated to the physical $u$, $d$ masses; that is, the central values are \"partially quenched.\" A calculation using \"fat-link clover\" valence fermions is also discussed but is not included in our final results. We find, for example, $f_B = 190 (7) (^{+24}_{-17}) (^{+11}_{-2}) (^{+8}_{-0})$ MeV, $f_{B_s}/f_B = 1.16 (1) (2) (2) (^{+4}_{-0})$, $f_{D_s} = 241 (5) (^{+27}_{-26}) (^{+9}_{-4}) (^{+5}_{-0})$ MeV, and $f_{B}/f_{D_s} = 0.79 (2) (^{+5}_{-4}) (3) (^{+5}_{-0})$, where in each case the first error is statistical and the remaining three are systematic: the error within the partially quenched $N_f=2$ approximation, the error due to the missing strange sea quark and to partial quenching, and an estimate of the effects of chiral logarithms at small quark mass. The last error, though quite significant in decay constant ratios, appears to be smaller than has been recently suggested by Kronfeld and Ryan, and Yamada. We emphasize, however, that as in other lattice computations to date, the lattice $u,d$ quark masses are not very light and chiral log effects may not be fully under control.",

      "summary": "The dependence of the nuclear force on standard model parameters plays an important role in bounding time and space variations of fundamental couplings over cosmological time scales. We discuss the quark-mass dependence of deuteron and di-neutron binding in a systematic chiral expansion. The leading quark-mass dependence of the nuclear force arises from one-pion exchange and from local quark-mass dependent four-nucleon operators with coefficients that are presently unknown. By varying these coefficients while leaving nuclear observables at the physical values of the quark masses invariant, we find scenarios where two-nucleon physics depends both weakly and strongly on the quark masses. While the determination of these coefficients is an exciting future opportunity for lattice QCD, we conclude that, at present, bounds on time and space variations of fundamental parameters from the two-nucleon sector are much weaker than previously claimed. This brings into question the reliability of coupling-constant bounds derived from more complex nuclei and nuclear processes.",

      "summary": "The feasibility of using lattice chiral fermions which are free of $O(a)$ errors for both the heavy and light quarks is examined. The fact that the effective quark propagators in these fermions have the same form as that in the continuum with the quark mass being only an additive parameter to a chirally symmetric antihermitian Dirac operator is highlighted. This implies that there is no distinction between the heavy and light quarks and no mass dependent tuning of the action or operators as long as the discretization error $O(m^2 a^2)$ is negligible. Using the overlap fermion, we find that the $O(m^2a^2)$ (and $O(ma^2)$) errors in the dispersion relations of the pseudoscalar and vector mesons and the renormalization of the axial-vector current and scalar density are small. This suggests that the applicable range of $ma$ may be extended to $\\sim 0.56$ with only 5% error, which is a factor of $\\sim 2.4$ larger than that of the improved Wilson action. We show that the generalized Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation with unequal masses can be utilized to determine the finite $ma$ errors in the renormalization of the matrix elements for the heavy-light decay constants and semileptonic decay constants of the B/D meson.",

      "summary": "Several physical problems in particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics require information from non-perturbative QCD to gain a full understanding. In some cases the most reliable technique for quantitative results is to carry out large-scale numerical calculations in lattice gauge theory. As in any numerical technique, there are several sources of uncertainty. This chapter explains how effective field theories are used to keep them under control and, then, obtain a sensible error bar. After a short survey of the numerical technique, we explain why effective field theories are necessary and useful. Then four important cases are reviewed: Symanzik's effective field theory of lattice spacing effects; heavy-quark effective theory as a tool for controlling discretization effects of heavy quarks; chiral perturbation theory as a tool for reaching the chiral limit; and a general field theory of hadrons for deriving finite volume corrections.",

The evaluation or at least stochastic estimation of ratios of fermionic determinants is essential for a recently proposed updating method of smeared link dynamical fermions. This update creates a sequence of configurations by changing a subset of the gauge links by a pure gauge heat bath or over relaxation step. The acceptance of the proposed configuration depends on the ratio of the fermionic determinants on the new and original configurations. We study this ratio as the function of the number of links that are changed in the heat bath update. We find that even when every link of a given direction and parity of a 10fm^4 configuration is updated, the average of the determinant ratio is still close to one and with the improved stochastic estimator the proposed change is accepted with about 20% probability. This improvement suggests that the new updating technique can be efficient even on large lattices.",

The resulting effective density is built from local chiralities studied previously. At every order of the expansion the density exactly sums up to the global topological charge, and the leading term describes the maximally smooth space-time distribution of charge relevant for propagating light fermions. We use this framework to demonstrate our previous suggestion that the bulk of topological charge in QCD does not effectively appear in the form of quantized unit lumps. Our conclusion implies that it is unlikely that the mixing of \"would-be\" zeromodes associated with such lumps is the prevalent microscopic mechanism for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. We also present first results quantitatively characterizing the space-time behavior of effective densities. For coherent fluctuations contained in spherical regions we find a continuous distribution of associated charges essentially ending at ~0.5.",

      "summary": "A cluster algorithm is constructed and applied to study the chiral limit of the strongly coupled lattice Schwinger model involving staggered fermions. The algorithm is based on a novel loop representation of the model. Finite size scaling of the chiral susceptibility based on data from lattices of size up to $64\\times 64$ indicates the absence of long range correlations at strong couplings. Assuming that there is no phase transition at a weaker coupling, the results imply that all mesons acquire a mass at non-zero lattice spacings. Although this does not violate any known physics, it is surprising since typically one expects a single pion to remain massless at non-zero lattice spacings in the staggered fermion formulation.",

At zero temperature there is some $μ_I$, $μ_c$ say, above which $I_3$ and parity are spontaneously broken by a charged pion condensate. This is in qualitative agreement with the prediction of effective (chiral) Lagrangians which also predict $μ_c=m_π$. This transition appears to be second order, with scaling properties consistent with the mean-field predictions of such effective Lagrangian models. We have also studied the restoration of $I_3$ symmetry at high temperature for $μ_I > μ_c$. For $μ_I$ sufficiently large, this finite temperature phase transition appears to be first order. As $μ_I$ is decreased it becomes second order connecting continuously with the zero temperature transition.",

Calculations of proton matrix elements of operators corresponding to these moments through the operator product expansion have been performed on $16^3 \\times 32$ lattices for Wilson fermions at $β= 5.6$ using configurations from the SESAM collaboration and at $β= 5.5$ using configurations from SCRI. One-loop perturbative renormalization corrections are included. At quark masses accessible in present calculations, there is no statistically significant difference between quenched and full QCD results, indicating that the contributions of quark-antiquark excitations from the Dirac Sea are small. Close agreement between calculations with cooled configurations containing essentially only instantons and the full gluon configurations indicates that quark zero modes associated with instantons play a dominant role. Naive linear extrapolation of the full QCD calculation to the physical pion mass yields results inconsistent with experiment. Extrapolation to the chiral limit including the physics of the pion cloud can resolve this discrepancy and the requirements for a definitive chiral extrapolation are described.",

In both of these theories there is some critical chemical potential above which the charge coupled to the chemical potential is spontaneously broken. In each case, the transition appears to be second order. We study the scaling properties near the critical point using scaling functions suggested by effective (chiral) Lagrangians and find evidence for scaling with mean-field critical exponents in each case. The subtleties associated with observing the critical scaling of these theories are discussed.",

      "summary": "Numerical simulations of strongly correlated electron systems suffer from the notorious fermion sign problem which has prevented progress in understanding if systems like the Hubbard model display high-temperature superconductivity. Here we show how the fermion sign problem can be solved completely with meron-cluster methods in a large class of models of strongly correlated electron systems, some of which are in the extended Hubbard model family and show s-wave superconductivity. In these models we also find that on-site repulsion can even coexist with a weak chemical potential without introducing sign problems. We argue that since these models can be simulated efficiently using cluster algorithms they are ideal for studying many of the interesting phenomena in strongly correlated electron systems.",

      "summary": "The reasons for using low-lying Dirac eigenmodes to probe the local structure of topological charge fluctuations in QCD are discussed, and it is pointed out that the qualitative double-peaked behavior of the local chiral orientation probability distribution in these modes is necessary, but not sufficient for dominance of instanton-like fluctuations. The results with overlap Dirac operator in Wilson gauge backgrounds at lattice spacings ranging from a~0.04 fm to a~0.12 fm are reported, and it is found that the size and density of local structures responsible for double-peaking of the distribution are in disagreement with the assumptions of the Instanton Liquid Model. More generally, our results suggest that vacuum fluctuations of topological charge are not effectively dominated by locally quantized (integer-valued) lumps in QCD.",
