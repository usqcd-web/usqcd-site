      "summary": "We present recent lattice results on QCD thermodynamics at non-vanishing baryon number density obtained from a 6th order Taylor expansion in the chemical potential. Results for bulk thermodynamic observables, in particular for fluctuations in the baryon number density, are found to be well described by a hadron resonance gas model at low temperature and an ideal quark gluon gas at high temperature. We also analyze the radius of convergence of the Taylor series and discuss the information it provides on the occurrence of a second order phase transition point in the QCD phase diagram.",

However, both are compatible with results expected in a theory with conformal symmetry. We investigate effective measures of conformal symmetry in the high temperature phase of QCD.",

The free energy of a center vortex extending into two spatial directions, which is introduced into Yang-Mills configurations when acting with the 't Hooft loop operator, is verified to furnish an order parameter for the deconfinement phase transition. It is shown to exhibit a weak discontinuity at the critical temperature, corresponding to the weak first order character of the transition.",

      "summary": "Durr and Hoelbling recently observed that the continuum and chiral limits do not commute in the two dimensional, one flavor, Schwinger model with staggered fermions. I point out that such lack of commutativity can also be seen in four-dimensional staggered chiral perturbation theory (SChPT) in quenched or partially quenched quantities constructed to be particularly sensitive to the chiral limit. Although the physics involved in the SChPT examples is quite different from that in the Schwinger model, neither singularity seems to be connected to the trick of taking the nth root of the fermion determinant to remove unwanted degrees of freedom (\"tastes\"). Further, I argue that the singularities in SChPT are absent in most commonly-computed quantities in the unquenched (full) QCD case and do not imply any unexpected systematic errors in recent MILC calculations with staggered fermions.",

Calculations are performed for three light flavors in the isospin limit and additionally for two light non-degenerate flavors. We use partially-quenched charge matrices that are easy to implement on the lattice. The results presented are necessary for the light quark mass extrapolation and zero-momentum extrapolation of lattice QCD and partially quenched lattice QCD calculations of heavy hadron electromagnetic properties. Additionally relations between the sextet electromagnetic form factors and transition form factors are derived.",

      "title": "Twisted mass chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order",
      "summary": "We study the properties of pions in twisted mass lattice QCD (with two degenerate flavors) using chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). We work to next-to-leading order (NLO) in a power counting scheme in which m_q ~ a Λ_QCD^2, with m_q the physical quark mass and a the lattice spacing. We argue that automatic O(a) improvement of physical quantities at maximal twist, which has been demonstrated in general if m_q >> a Λ_QCD^2, holds even if m_q ~ a Λ_QCD^2, as long as one uses an appropriate non-perturbative definition of the twist angle. We demonstrate this with explicit calculations, for arbitrary twist angle, of all pionic quantities that involve no more than a single pion in the initial and final states: masses, decay constants, form factors and condensates, as well as the differences between alternate definitions of twist angle. We also calculate the axial and pseudoscalar form factors of the pion, quantities which violate flavor and parity, and which vanish in the continuum limit. These are of interest because they are not automatically O(a) improved at maximal twist. They allow a determination of the unknown low energy constants introduced by discretization errors, and provide tests of the accuracy of ChPT at NLO. We extend our results into the regime where m_q ~ a^2 Λ_QCD^3, and argue in favor of a recent proposal that automatic O(a) improvement at maximal twist remains valid in this regime.",

      "summary": "In pure gauge SU(3) near beta = 6, weak and strong coupling expansions break down and the MC method seems to be the only practical alternative. We discuss the possibility of using a modified version of perturbation theory which relies on a large field cutoff and has been successfully applied to the double-well potential (Y. M., PRL 88 141601). Generically, in the case of scalar field theory, the weak coupling expansion is unable to reproduce the exponential suppression of the large field configurations. This problem can be solved by introducing a large field cutoff. The value of this cutoff can be chosen to reduce the discrepancy with the original problem. This optimization can be approximately performed using the strong coupling expansion and bridges the gap between the two expansions. We report recent attempts to extend this procedure for SU(3) gauge theory on the lattice. We compare gauge invariant and gauge dependent (in the Landau gauge) criteria to sort the configurations into ``large-field'' and ``small-field'' configurations. %We discuss the effects of discarding the large field configurations. We discuss the convergence of lattice perturbation theory and the way it can be modified in order to obtain results similar to the scalar case.",

The approach starts from the twisted form of the continuum super Yang Mills action which we show may be written in terms of two real Kahler-Dirac fields whose components transform into each other under the twisted supersymmetry. Once the theory is written in this geometrical language it is straightforward to discretize by mapping the component tensor fields to appropriate geometrical structures in the lattice and by replacing the continuum exterior derivative and its adjoint by appropriate lattice covariant difference operators. The lattice action is local and possesses a unique vacuum state while the use of Kahler-Dirac fermions ensures the model does not exhibit spectrum doubling.",

      "title": "The Analysis of Space-Time Structure in QCD Vacuum I: Localization vs Global Behavior in Local Observables and Dirac Eigenmodes",
      "summary": "The structure of QCD vacuum can be studied from first principles using lattice-regularized theory. This line of research entered a qualitatively new phase recently, wherein the space-time structure (at least for some quantities) can be directly observed in configurations dominating the QCD path integral, i.e. without any subjective processing of typical configurations. This approach to QCD vacuum structure does not rely on any proposed picture of QCD vacuum but rather attempts to characterize this structure in a model-independent manner, so that a coherent physical picture of the vacuum can emerge when such unbiased numerical information accumulates to a sufficient degree. An important part of this program is to develop a set of suitable quantitative characteristics describing the space-time structure in a meaningful and physically relevant manner. One of the basic pertinent issues here is whether QCD vacuum dynamics can be understood in terms of localized vacuum objects, or whether such objects behave as inherently global entities. The first direct studies of vacuum structure strongly support the latter. In this paper, we develop a formal framework which allows to answer this question in a quantitative manner. We discuss in detail how to apply this approach to Dirac eigenmodes and to basic scalar and pseudoscalar composites of gauge fields (action density and topological charge density). The approach is illustrated numerically on overlap Dirac zeromodes and near-zeromodes. This illustrative data provides direct quantitative evidence supporting our earlier arguments for the global nature of QCD Dirac eigenmodes.",

Numerical calculations are done on two lattices with different lattice spacing $a$ and the same physical volume. We have calculated the nonperturbative wave function renormalization function $Z(q)$ and the nonperturbative mass function $M(p)$ for a variety of bare quark masses and perform a simple linear extrapolation to the chiral limit. We focus on the comparison of the behavior of $Z(q)$ and $M(p)$ in the chiral limit in the two gauge fixing schemes as well as the behavior on two lattices with different lattice spacing $a$. We find that the mass functions $M(p)$ are very similar for the two gauges while the wave-function renormalization function $Z(q)$ is more strongly infrared suppressed in the Laplacian gauge than in the Landau gauge on the finer lattice. For Laplacian gauge, it seems that the finite $a$ error is large on the coarse lattice which has a lattice spacing $a$ of about 0.124 fm.",

The fermion propagator on the lattice inevitably yields a diagram with nonvanishing UV degree D=0 contribution in lattice perturbation theory, in contrast to what occurs in the continuum. This diagram gives a finite correction to the boson 2-point function that must be subtracted off in order to obtain the perturbation series of the continuum theory, in the limit where the lattice spacing $a$ vanishes. Using a transfer matrix approach, we provide a nonperturbative proof that this counterterm suffices to yield the desired continuum limit. This analysis also allows us to improve the action to O(a). We demonstrate by Monte Carlo simulation that the spectrum of the continuum theory is well-approximated at finite but small $a$, for both weak and strong coupling. We contrast the above situation for the naive lattice action to what occurs for the supersymmetric lattice action, which preserves a discrete version of half the supersymmetry. There, cancellations between D=0 diagrams occur, obviating the need for counterterms.",

Progressively smaller static magnetic fields are introduced on a $24^4$ latticeat beta=6.0 and the pion mass is probed down to about 500 MeV. Magnetic moments are extracted from the linear response of the masses to the external field.",

      "summary": "We study strongly coupled lattice QCD with $N$ colors of staggered fermions in 3+1 dimensions. While mean field theory describes the low temperature behavior of this theory at large $N$, it fails in the scaling region close to the finite temperature second order chiral phase transition. The universal critical region close to the phase transition belongs to the 3d XY universality class even when $N$ becomes large. This is in contrast to Gross-Neveu models where the critical region shrinks as $N$ (the number of flavors) increases and mean field theory is expected to describe the phase transition exactly in the limit of infinite $N$. Our work demonstrates that close to second order phase transitions infrared fluctuations can sometimes be important even when $N$ is strictly infinite.",

      "summary": "We consider Wilson's SU(N) lattice gauge theory (without fermions) at negative values of beta= 2N/g^2 and for N=2 or 3. We show that in the limit beta -> -infinity, the path integral is dominated by configurations where links variables are set to a nontrivial element of the center on selected non intersecting lines. For N=2, these configurations can be characterized by a unique gauge invariant set of variables, while for N=3 a multiplicity growing with the volume as the number of configurations of an Ising model is observed. In general, there is a discontinuity in the average plaquette when g^2 changes its sign which prevents us from having a convergent series in g^2 for this quantity. For N=2, a change of variables relates the gauge invariant observables at positive and negative values of beta. For N=3, we derive an identity relating the observables at beta with those at beta rotated by +- 2pi/3 in the complex plane and show numerical evidence for a Ising like first order phase transition near beta=-22. We discuss the possibility of having lines of first order phase transitions ending at a second order phase transition in an extended bare parameter space.",

When the discretization errors are significant, there may be an Aoki-like phase for staggered fermions, where the remnant SO(4) taste symmetry is broken down to SO(3). We solve explicitly for the mass spectrum in the 3-flavor degenerate mass case and discuss qualitatively the 2+1-flavor case. From numerical results we find that current simulations are outside the staggered Aoki phase. As for near-future simulations with more improved versions of the staggered action, it seems unlikely that these will be in the Aoki phase for any realistic value of the quark mass, although the evidence is not conclusive.",

Because the data produced by completed computations form the basis for future work, the maintenance of archives of existing data and metadata describing the provenance, generation parameters, and derived characteristics of that data is essential not only as a reference, but also as a basis for future work. Development of these archives according to uniform standards both in the data and metadata formats provided and in the software interfaces to the component services could greatly simplify collaborations between institutions and enable the dissemination of meaningful results.\n  This paper describes the progress made in the development of a set of such archives at the Fermilab lattice QCD facility. We are coordinating the development of the interfaces to these facilities and the formats of the data and metadata they provide with the efforts of the international lattice data grid (ILDG) metadata and middleware working groups, whose goals are to develop standard formats for lattice QCD data and metadata and a uniform interface to archive facilities that store them. Services under development include those commonly associate with data grids: a service registry, a metadata database, a replica catalog, and an interface to a mass storage system. All services provide GSI authenticated web service interfaces following modern standards, including WSDL and SOAP, and accept and provide data and metadata following recent XML based formats proposed by the ILDG metadata working group.",

For the coarse configurations, with a=0.12 fm, eight combinations of dynamical light and strange quarks have been analyzed. For the fine configurations, with a=0.09 fm, three combinations of quark masses are studied. Since we last reported on this calculation, statistics have been increased on the fine ensembles, and, more importantly, a preliminary value for the perturbative renormalization of the axial-vector current has become available. Thus, results for f_B, f_{B_s}, f_D and f_{D_s} can, in principle, be calculated in MeV, in addition to decay-constant ratios that were calculated previously.",

Importantly, flavour-singlet matrix elements can be evaluated without requiring the computation of disconnected diagrams, thus facilitating a calculation of the quark contribution to the spin of the proton and the singlet axial coupling, $g_A^0$. In the two nucleon sector, a background field approach will allow calculation of the magnetic and quadrupole moments of the deuteron and an investigation of the EMC effect directly from lattice QCD. Matrix elements between states of differing momenta are also analysed in the presence of background fields.",

We report our preliminary results on the Polyakov loop in different baryon number sectors which exhibit deconfinement transitions on small lattices. The largest density we obtain around $T_c$ is an order of magnitude larger than that of nuclear matter. From the conserved vector current, we calculate the quark number and verify that the mixing of different baryon sectors is small.",

We find that the finite momenta charmonia show medium modifications when the medium is deconfined; in particular, a modification of the energy-momentum dispersion relation is indicated.",

The results for B decays are preliminary. Combining our results with experimental branching ratios, we then obtain the CKM matrix elements $|V_{cd}|$, $|V_{cs}|$, $|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$.

In the microscopic limit of small energy levels the results should be an accurate description of QCD. This new model can also be scaled so that all physical observables remain at their $μ=0$ values until a first order chiral restoration transition is reached. This gives a more realistic model for the QCD phase diagram than previous RMM. We also mention how the model might aid in determining the phase diagram of QCD from future numerical simulations.",

The suppression is sensitive to the number of light sea quark flavors. Our study is done in the presence of 2+1 flavors of dynamical quarks in the improved staggered fermion formulation. Variance-reduction techniques provide better control of statistical errors. New results from staggered chiral perturbation theory account for taste-breaking effects in the low-quark mass behavior of the susceptibility, thereby reducing scaling violations from this source. Measurements over a range of quark masses at two lattice spacings permit a rough continuum extrapolation to remove the remaining lattice artifacts. The results are consistent with chiral perturbation theory with the correct flavor counting.",

      "summary": "We study the improvement of staggered fermions using hypercubically smeared (HYP) links. We calculate the strange quark mass and the kaon B-parameter, $B_K$, in quenched QCD on a $16^3 \\times 64$ lattice at $β=6.0$. We find $m_s(\\bar{\\rm MS},2 {\\rm GeV})=101.2\\pm1.3\\pm4 $MeV and $B_K(\\bar{\\rm MS},2 {\\rm GeV}) = 0.578 \\pm 0.018\\pm 0.042$, where the first error is from statistics and fitting, and the second from using one-loop matching factors. The scale ($1/a=1.95$GeV) is set by $M_ρ$, and $m_s$ is determined using the kaon mass. Comparing to quenched results obtained using unimproved staggered fermions and other discretizations, we argue that the size of discretization errors in $B_K$ is substantially reduced by improvement.",

The value for $f_K/f_π$ implies $|V_{us}|=0.2219(26)$. We also obtain $m_u/m_d = 0.43(0)(1)(8)$, or, with more input on electromagnetic effects from the continuum, $m_u/m_d = 0.41(0)(1)(4)$. Using the one-loop perturbative mass renormalization, we determine $m_u$ and $m_d$ in the MSbar scheme.",

We extend the staggered chiral Lagrangian to O(a^2 p^2), O(a^4) and O(a^2 m), the orders necessary for a full next-to-leading order calculation of pseudo-Goldstone boson masses and decay constants including analytic terms. We then calculate a number of SO(4) taste-breaking quantities, which involve only a small subset of these NLO operators. We predict relationships between SO(4) taste-breaking splittings in masses, pseudoscalar decay constants, and dispersion relations. We also find predictions for a few quantities that are not SO(4) breaking. All these results hold also for theories in which the fourth-root of the fermionic determinant is taken to reduce the number of quark tastes; testing them will therefore provide evidence for or against the validity of this trick.",

Simulations are carried out using ensembles of unquenched gauge fields generated by the MILC collaboration. With an improved staggered action for light quarks, we are able to simulate at light quark masses down to 1/8 of the strange mass. Consequently, the systematic error from the chiral extrapolation is much smaller than in previous calculations with Wilson-type light quarks. Our results for the form factors at $q^2=0$ are $f_+^{D\\toπ}(0)=0.64(3)(6)$ and $f_+^{D\\to K}(0) = 0.73(3)(7)$, where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic, added in quadrature. Combining our results with experimental branching ratios, we obtain the CKM matrix elements $|V_{cd}|=0.239(10)(24)(20)$ and $|V_{cs}|=0.969(39)(94)(24)$, where the last errors are from experimental uncertainties.",

Independent calculations using two fermion actions were done for consistency and comparison purposes. One calculation uses Wilson fermions with a lattice spacing of $a=0.10 $fm. The other uses tadpole improved Lüsher-Weiss gauge fields and clover quark action with a lattice spacing $a=0.17 $fm. Our results for neutron electric polarizability are compared to experiment.",

In the standard model, quarks have fractional charge, raising the question of whether the basic magnetic monople unit is a multiple of $2 π/e$ or three times that. A simple lattice construction shows how a magnetic monopole of the lower strength is possible if it interacts with gluonic fields as well. Such a monopole is thus a hadron. This is consistent with the construction of magnetic monopoles in grand unified theories.",

Although the method suffers from a sign problem at low temperatures, the new algorithm has many advantages over conventional algorithms. For example, the model can be easily simulated in the Kondo limit without time discretization errors. Further, many observables including the impurity susceptibility and a variety of fermionic observables can be calculated efficiently. Finally the new approach allows us to explore a general technique, called the multi-level algorithm, to solve the sign problem. We find that the multi-level algorithm is able to generate an exponentially large number of configurations with an effort that grows as a polynomial in inverse temperature such that configurations with a positive sign dominate over those with negative signs. Our algorithm can be easily generalized to other multi-impurity problems.",

      "summary": "It is popular to probe the structure of the QCD vacuum indirectly by studying individual fermion eigenmodes, because this provides a natural way to filter out UV fluctuations. The double-peaking in the distribution of the local chiral orientation parameter (X) has been offered as evidence, by some, in support of a particular model of the vacuum. Here we caution that the X-distribution peaking varies significantly with various versions of the definition of X. Furthermore, each distribution varies little from that resulting from a random reshuffling of the left-handed (and independently the right-handed) fields, which destroys any QCD-induced left-right correlation; that is, the double-peaking is mostly a phase-space effect. We propose a new universal definition of the X parameter whose distribution is uniform for randomly reshuffled fields. Any deviations from uniformity for actual data can then be directly attributable to QCD-induced dynamics. We find that the familiar double peak disappears.",

This enables us to study the finite-temperature chiral-symmetry-restoring phase transition for 2 massless quark flavours, which is believed to be second order.

Our earlier simulations on $N_t=4$ and $N_t=6$ lattices revealed that finite lattice-spacing artifacts on such coarse lattices affect the nature of the transition.

      "summary": "As part of our program of lattice simulations of three flavor QCD with improved staggered quarks, we have calculated pseudoscalar meson masses and decay constants for a range of valence quark masses and sea quark masses on lattices with lattice spacings of about 0.125 fm and 0.09 fm. We fit the lattice data to forms computed with staggered chiral perturbation theory. Our results provide a sensitive test of the lattice simulations, and especially of the chiral behavior, including the effects of chiral logarithms. We find: f_π=129.5(0.9)(3.5)MeV, f_K=156.6(1.0)(3.6)MeV, and f_K/f_π=1.210(4)(13), where the errors are statistical and systematic. Following a recent paper by Marciano, our value of f_K/f_πimplies |V_{us}|=0.2219(26). Further, we obtain m_u/m_d= 0.43(0)(1)(8), where the errors are from statistics, simulation systematics, and electromagnetic effects, respectively. The data can also be used to determine several of the constants of the low energy effective Lagrangian: in particular we find 2L_8-L_5=-0.2(1)(2) 10^{-3} at chiral scale m_η. This provides an alternative (though not independent) way of estimating m_u; 2L_8-L_5 is far outside the range that would allow m_u=0. Results for m_s^\\msbar, \\hat m^\\msbar, and m_s/\\hat m can be obtained from the same lattice data and chiral fits, and have been presented previously in joint work with the HPQCD and UKQCD collaborations. Using the perturbative mass renormalization reported in that work, we obtain m_u^\\msbar=1.7(0)(1)(2)(2)MeV and m_d^\\msbar=3.9(0)(1)(4)(2)MeV at scale 2 GeV, with errors from statistics, simulation, perturbation theory, and electromagnetic effects, respectively.",

      "summary": "We simulate 2-flavour lattice QCD at finite isospin chemical potential mu_I, for temperatures close to the finite temperature transition from hadronic matter to a quark-gluon plasma. The mu_I dependence of the transition coupling is observed and used to estimate the decrease in the transition temperature with increasing mu_I. These simulations are performed on an 8^3 times 4 lattice at 3 different quark masses. Our estimate of the magnitude of the fluctuations of the phase of the fermion determinant at small quark-number chemical potential mu, suggest that the position of the small mu and small mu_I transitions should be the same for mu_I=2mu, and we argue that the nature of these transitions should be the same. For all mu_I < m_pi the smoothness of these transitions and the values of the Binder cumulant B_4, indicate that these transitions are mere crossovers, and show no sign of the expected critical endpoint. For mu_I > m_pi and a small isospin (I_3) breaking term lambda, we do find evidence of a critical endpoint which would indicate that, for lambda=0, there is a tricritical point on the phase boundary where the pion condensate evaporates, where this phase transition changes from second to first order.",

We first determine the chiral Lagrangian including discretization effects up to next-to-leading order (NLO) in a combined expansion in which m_π^2/(4πf_π)^2 ~ a Λ(a being the lattice spacing, and Λ= Λ_{QCD}). We then focus on the region where m_π^2/(4πf_π)^2 ~ (a Λ)^2, in which case competition between leading and NLO terms can lead to phase transitions. As for untwisted Wilson fermions, we find two possible phase diagrams, depending on the sign of a coefficient in the chiral Lagrangian. For one sign, there is an Aoki phase for pure Wilson fermions, with flavor and parity broken, but this is washed out into a crossover if the twisted mass is non-vanishing. For the other sign, there is a first order transition for pure Wilson fermions, and we find that this transition extends into the twisted mass plane, ending with two symmetrical second order points at which the mass of the neutral pion vanishes. We provide graphs of the condensate and pion masses for both scenarios, and note a simple mathematical relation between them. These results may be of importance to numerical simulations.",

We formulate the conditions under which the interacting lattice theory can exactly preserve one or more nilpotent anticommuting supersymmetries. We introduce a superfield formalism, which allows the enumeration of all possible lattice supersymmetry invariants. We use it to discuss the formulation of Q-exact lattice actions and their renormalization in a general manner. In some examples, one exact supersymmetry guarantees finiteness of the continuum limit of the lattice theory. As a consequence, we show that the desired quantum continuum limit is obtained without fine tuning for these models. Finally, we discuss the implications and possible further applications of our results to the study of gauge and non-gauge models.",

Pion zero-modes enter the $ε^\\prime$-counting perturbatively, in contrast to both the $ε$- and $δ$-power-countings, since $m_q < q\\bar{q}> V$ remains large. However, these modes are enhanced over those with non-zero momenta and enter at lower orders in the $ε^\\prime$-expansion than they would in large volume chiral perturbation theory.

Ambiguities in the definition of a coupling beyond the perturbative regime are discussed in their relation to phenomenological considerations on heavy quark bound states in the quark gluon plasma. Our analysis suggests that it is more appropriate to characterize the non-perturbative properties of the QCD plasma phase close to T_c in terms remnants of the confinement part of the QCD force rather than a strong Coulombic force.",

      "summary": "We report on a study of QCD thermodynamics with three flavors of quarks, using a Symanzik improved gauge action and the Asqtad O(a^2) improved staggered quark action. Simulations were carried out with lattice spacings 1/4T, 1/6T and 1/8T both for three degenerate quarks with masses less than or equal to the strange quark mass, m_s, and for degenerate up and down quarks with masses in the range 0.1 m_s \\leq m_{u,d} \\leq 0.6 m_s, and the strange quark mass fixed near its physical value. We present results for standard thermodynamics quantities, such as the Polyakov loop, the chiral order parameter and its susceptibility. For the quark masses studied to date we find a rapid crossover rather than a bona fide phase transition. We have carried out the first calculations of quark number susceptibilities with three flavors of sea quarks. These quantities are of physical interest because they are related to event-by-event fluctuations in heavy ion collision experiments. Comparison of susceptibilities at different lattice spacings show that our results are close to the continuum values.",

      "summary": "The $SU(N_f)_L \\otimes SU(N_f)_R$ chiral symmetry of QCD is of central importance for the nonperturbative low-energy dynamics of light quarks and gluons. Lattice field theory provides a theoretical framework in which these dynamics can be studied from first principles. The implementation of chiral symmetry on the lattice is a nontrivial issue. In particular, local lattice fermion actions with the chiral symmetry of the continuum theory suffer from the fermion doubling problem. The Ginsparg-Wilson relation implies Lüscher's lattice variant of chiral symmetry which agrees with the usual one in the continuum limit. Local lattice fermion actions that obey the Ginsparg-Wilson relation have an exact chiral symmetry, the correct axial anomaly, they obey a lattice version of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, and still they do not suffer from the notorious doubling problem. The Ginsparg-Wilson relation is satisfied exactly by Neuberger's overlap fermions which are a limit of Kaplan's domain wall fermions, as well as by Hasenfratz and Niedermayer's classically perfect lattice fermion actions. When chiral symmetry is nonlinearly realized in effective field theories on the lattice, the doubling problem again does not arise. This review provides an introduction to chiral symmetry on the lattice with an emphasis on the basic theoretical framework.",

However, we find that the same observable in the phase-quenched ensemble takes a very different, perhaps encouraging, average value.

The first system is solved with a deflated GMRES method that generates eigenvector information at the same time that the linear equations are solved. Subsequent systems are solved by combining an iterative method with a projection over the previously determined eigenvectors. Restarted GMRES is considered for the iterative method as well as non-restarted methods such as BiCGSTAB. These methods offer an alternative to block methods, and they can also be combined with a block approach. An example is given showing significant improvement for a problem from quantum chromodynamics.",

      "title": "Quark mass dependence of the pseudoscalar hairpin vertex",
      "summary": "In a recent investigation of chiral behavior in quenched lattice QCD, the flavor-singlet pseudoscalar ``hairpin'' vertex associated with the eta prime mass was studied for pion masses ranging from approximately 275 to 675 MeV. Throughout this mass range, the quark-disconnected pseudoscalar correlator is well-described by a pure double-pion-pole diagram with a p^2 independent mass insertion. The residue of the double pole was found to exhibit a significant quark mass dependence, evidenced by a negative slope of the effective mass insertion (m_0^{eff})^2 as a function of m_π^2. It has been observed by Sharpe that, with a consistent NLO calculation in quenched chiral perturbation theory, this mass dependence is uniquely predicted in terms of the single-pole coefficient α_Φ and the Leutwyler parameter L_5. Since α_Φ is found to be approximately zero, the chiral slope of the double-pole residue determines a value for L_5. This provides a consistency check between the chiral slope of the hairpin mass insertion and that of the pion decay constant. We investigate the consistency of these mass dependences in our Monte Carlo results at two values of lattice spacing. Within statistics, the slopes are found to be consistent with the Q\\chiPT prediction, confirming that the observed negative slope of m_0^{eff} arises as an effect of the L_5 Leutwyler term.",

      "summary": "We introduce the ``Sequential Empirical Bayes Method'', an adaptive constrained-curve fitting procedure for extracting reliable priors. These are then used in standard augmented-$χ^2$ fits on separate data. This better stabilizes fits to lattice QCD overlap-fermion data at very low quark mass where {\\it a priori} values are not otherwise known. Lessons learned (including caveats limiting the scope of the method) from studying artificial data are presented. As an illustration, from local-local two-point correlation functions, we obtain masses and spectral weights for ground and first-excited states of the pion, give preliminary fits for the $a_0$ where ghost states (a quenched artifact) must be dealt with, and elaborate on the details of fits of the Roper resonance and $S_{11}(N^{1/2-})$ previously presented elsewhere. The data are from overlap fermions on a quenched $16^3\\times 28$ lattice with spatial size $La=3.2 {\\rm fm}$ and pion mass as low as $\\sim 180 {\\rm MeV}$.",

We also find that the parameters of the model can be scaled to remove the effects of the chemical potential from all thermodynamic quantities until the finite density phase transition is reached.

More precisely, we show how to determine the short-distance contributions to low-momentum transfer electroweak matrix elements in the two-nucleon sector from lattice QCD. In potential model descriptions of multi-nucleon systems, this is equivalent to uniquely determining the meson-exchange currents, while in the context of nuclear effective field theory, this translates into determining the coefficients of local, gauge-invariant, multi-nucleon-electroweak current operators. The energies of the lowest-lying states of two nucleons on a finite volume lattice with periodic boundary conditions in the presence of a background magnetic field are sufficient to determine the local four-nucleon operators that contribute to the deuteron magnetic moment and to the threshold cross-section of n + p -> d + gamma. Similarly, the energy-levels of two nucleons immersed in a background isovector axial weak field can be used to determine the coefficient of the leading local four-nucleon operator contributing to the neutral- and charged-current break-up of the deuteron. This is required for the extraction of solar neutrino fluxes at SNO and future neutrino experiments.",

      "summary": "We have extended our program of QCD simulations with an improved Kogut-Susskind quark action to a smaller lattice spacing, approximately 0.09 fm. Also, the simulations with a approximately 0.12 fm have been extended to smaller quark masses. In this paper we describe the new simulations and computations of the static quark potential and light hadron spectrum. These results give information about the remaining dependences on the lattice spacing. We examine the dependence of computed quantities on the spatial size of the lattice, on the numerical precision in the computations, and on the step size used in the numerical integrations. We examine the effects of autocorrelations in \"simulation time\" on the potential and spectrum. We see effects of decays, or coupling to two-meson states, in the 0++, 1+, and 0- meson propagators, and we make a preliminary mass computation for a radially excited 0- meson.",

The surface of the percolating cluster appears random at short distances, with action density depending on the shape.",

It consists in simulating QCD in the background of a ''electromagnetic\" field whose potential is non-vanishing, but whose field strength is zero. By tuning the background field, phase-shifts at any (but small) momenta can be determined by measuring the shift of the ground state energy. Lattice sizes as small as 5 Fermi can be sufficient for the calculation of phase shifts up to momenta of order of $m_π/2$.",

The spectrum, with string-like excitations on the largest length scales of 2-3 fm, provides clues in its rich fine structure for developing an effective bosonic string description. New results are reported from the three-dimensional Z(2) and SU(2) gauge models, providing further insight into the mechanism of bosonic string formation. The precocious onset of string-like behavior in the Casimir energy of the static quark-antiquark ground state is observed below R=1 fm where most of the string eigenmodes do not exist and the few stable excitations above the ground state are displaced. We find no firm theoretical foundation for the widely held view of discovering string formation from high precision ground state properties below the 1 fm scale.",

We focus on the physics of the remnant O(2) chiral symmetry of staggered fermions in the strong coupling limit using the recently discovered directed path algorithm. Since it is easier to look for power-like singularities as compared to logarithmic ones, our calculations are performed at a fixed finite temperature in the chirally broken phase. We show that the behavior of the chiral condensate, the pion mass and the pion decay constant, for small masses, are all consistent with the predictions of ChPT.\n  However, the values of the quark masses that we need to demonstrate this are much smaller than those being used in dynamical QCD simulations. We also need to use higher order terms in the chiral expansion to fit our data.",
