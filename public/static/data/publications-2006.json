      "summary": "Using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory, we consider the light quark-mass and spatial volume dependence of the matrix elements of ΔB=2 and ΔC=2 four-quark operators relevant for B^{0}_{(s)}{-}\\bar{B}^{0}_{(s)} and D^{0}{-}\\bar{D}^{0} mixing, and the B_{s} meson width difference. Our results for these matrix elements are obtained in the N_{f}=2+1 partially quenched theory, which becomes full QCD in the limit where sea and valence quark masses become equal. They can be used in extrapolation of lattice calculations of these matrix elements to the physical light quark masses and to infinite volume. An important conclusion of this paper is that the chiral extrapolations for matrix elements of heavy-light meson mixing beyond the Standard Model, and those relevant for the B_s width difference are more complicated than that for the Standard Model mixing matrix elements.",

Our analysis is performed using partially-quenched chiral perturbation theory.

These results are useful for extrapolations of lattice calculations of these matrix elements at small momentum transfer to the physical regime.",

      "summary": "The realization of global symmetries can depend on the geometry of the underlying space. In particular, compactification can lead to spontaneous breaking of such symmetries. Four-dimensional QCD with fundamental representation fermions embedded in a space with one compact spatial dimension has a critical length, at which the theory undergoes a phase transition and develops a ground state that is no longer charge conjugation invariant. We show this behavior with simulations of three color, four flavor QCD. We use unrooted staggered fermion at two values of the lattice spacing and several quark masses. We discuss the dependence of the transition on the dynamical fermion mass as well as its connection to the finite temperature and chiral phase transitions.",

This supersymmetry arises after a reformulation of the theory in terms of {\\it twisted} fields. In this paper we derive the action of the other twisted supersymmetries on the component fields and study, using Monte Carlo simulation, a series of corresponding Ward identities. Our results for SU(2) and SU(3) support a restoration of these additional supersymmetries without fine tuning in the infinite volume continuum limit. Additionally we present evidence supporting a restoration of (twisted) rotational invariance in the same limit. Finally we have examined the distribution of scalar field eigenvalues and find evidence for power law tails extending out to large eigenvalue. We argue that these tails indicate that the classical moduli space does not survive in the quantum theory.",

      "summary": "We present results for the static interquark potential, light meson and baryon masses, and light pseudoscalar meson decay constants obtained from simulations of domain wall QCD with one dynamical flavour approximating the $s$ quark, and two degenerate dynamical flavours with input bare masses ranging from $m_s$ to $m_s/4$ approximating the $u$ and $d$ quarks. We compare these quantities obtained using the Iwasaki and DBW2 improved gauge actions, and actions with larger rectangle coefficients, on $16^3\\times32$ lattices. We seek parameter values at which both the chiral symmetry breaking residual mass due to the finite lattice extent in the fifth dimension and the Monte Carlo time history for topological charge are acceptable for this set of quark masses at lattice spacings above 0.1 fm. We find that the Iwasaki gauge action is best, demonstrating the feasibility of using QCDOC to generate ensembles which are good representations of the QCD path integral on lattices of up to 3 fm in spatial extent with lattice spacings in the range 0.09-0.13 fm.

      "summary": "We study a systematic improvement of perturbation theory for gauge fields on the lattice [hep-lat/0606001]; the improvement entails resumming, to all orders in the coupling constant, a dominant subclass of tadpole diagrams.\n  This method, originally proposed for the Wilson gluon action, is extended here to encompass all possible gluon actions made of closed Wilson loops; any fermion action can be employed as well. The effect of resummation is to replace various parameters in the action (coupling constant, Symanzik and clover coefficient) by ``dressed'' values; the latter are solutions to certain coupled integral equations, which are easy to solve numerically.\n  Some positive features of this method are: a) It is gauge invariant, b) it can be systematically applied to improve (to all orders) results obtained at any given order in perturbation theory, c) it does indeed absorb in the dressed parameters the bulk of tadpole contributions.\n  Two different applications are presented: The additive renormalization of fermion masses, and the multiplicative renormalization Z_V (Z_A) of the vector (axial) current. In many cases where non-perturbative estimates of renormalization functions are also available for comparison, the agreement with improved perturbative results is consistently better as compared to results from bare perturbation theory.",

We show that the lattice model has a $SU(2)\\times SU(2)\\times U(1)$ chiral symmetry and can be used to model the two-flavor QCD chiral phase transition in the absence of the anomaly. It is also possible to add a coupling to this model which breaks the chiral symmetry to $SU(2)\\times SU(2)$ and thus mimics the effects of the anomaly in two-flavor QCD. We construct an efficient directed loop algorithm to study such a model. We show that the chiral phase transition in our model is first order in the absence of the anomaly, while it becomes second order with O(4) exponents when the anomaly is turned on.",

We use mixed action effective field theory to discuss that through next-to-leading order, simulations of meson systems which employ valence quarks satisfying the Ginsparg-Wilson relation (lattice-chiral symmetry), depend only upon the physical counterterms of interest, provided one uses a lattice-physical (on-shell) renormalization scheme. With this lattice-physical renormalization, the I = 2 pi-pi, I = 3/2 K-pi, I=1 K-K meson scattering lengths combined with f_K / f_pi share only two linearly independent counterterms, both of which are physical. This allows us to make use of existing lattice QCD simulations to make a prediction of the I = 1 K-K scattering length.",

Using a set of derivative based operators we report our exploratory study of these mesons in charmonium region. We use a 12^3 X 48 anisotropic (xi = 3) clover lattice with inverse temporal lattice spacing a^-1 = 6.05 GeV.

We employ the Sheikholeslami-Wohlert (clover) improved action for Wilson fermions and the Symanzik improved gluon action for 4- and 6-link loops.\n  The quantity which we study is a typical case of a vacuum expectation value resulting in an additive renormalization; as such, it is characterized by a power (linear) divergence in the lattice spacing, and its calculation lies at the limits of applicability of perturbation theory.\n  Our results are polynomial in c_{SW} (clover parameter) and cover a wide range of values for the Symanzik coefficients c_i. Furthermore, the dependence on the number of colors N and the number of fermionic flavors N_f is shown explicitly. In order to compare our results to non perturbative evaluations of kappa_c coming from Monte Carlo simulations, we employ an improved perturbation theory method applied to improved actions.",

      "summary": "Unphysical effects associated with finite lattice spacing and partial quenching may lead to the presence of unphysical terms in chiral extrapolation formulae. These unphysical terms must then be removed during data analysis before physical predictions can be made. In this work, we show that through next-to-leading order, there are no unphysical counterterms in the extrapolation formulae, expressed in lattice-physical parameters, for meson scattering lengths in theories with Ginsparg-Wilson valence quarks. Our work applies to most sea quark discretization, provided that chiral perturbation theory is a valid approximation. We demonstrate our results with explicit computations and show that, in favorable circumstances, the extrapolation formulae do not depend on the unknown constant C_Mix appearing at lowest order in the mixed action chiral Lagrangian. We show that the I=1 KK scattering length does not depend on C_Mix in contrast to the I=3/2 K-pi scattering length. In addition, we show that these observables combined with f_K / f_pi and the I=2 pi-pi scattering length share only two linearly independent sets of counterterms, providing a means to test the mixed action theory at one lattice spacing. We therefore make a prediction for the I=1 KK scattering length.",

Compared to the SU(2) and SU(3) models studied previously, which reproduce the infrared properties of the corresponding Yang-Mills theories on the basis of a simple vortex world-surface curvature action, new dynamical characteristics become important. In the SU(4) case, an explicit dependence of the vortex effective action on the configuration of the Abelian magnetic monopoles residing on the vortices emerges; in the Sp(2) case, a new \"stickiness\" contribution to the vortex action serves to drive the deconfinement phase transition towards the correct first-order behavior.",

The simplest regularization of this type uses the proposition that the classical limit of scalar gauge density associated with trace of D is (up to an additive constant) proportional to tr(FF), while the corresponding operator is local. More general formulations from this class are considered with the aim of exposing interrelations between gauge and fermionic aspects of QCD which are otherwise hidden in generic formulations.

For dynamical simulations, we show that the pion dispersion relation is modified by volume effects. In the isospin limit, we demonstrate that the pion electromagnetic form factor can be computed on the lattice at continuous values of the momentum transfer. Furthermore, the finite volume effects are under theoretical control for extraction of the pion charge radius.",

Using the two-flavor dynamical domain-wall QCD configurations combined with the quenched non-compact QED configurations, the electromagnetic mass splittings between isomultiplets (p, n), (Sigma^+, Sigma^0, Sigma^-), (Xi^0, Xi^-) are investigated. We evaluate the main source of statistical fluctuations in the two-point correlation function, and find that the elimination of O(e) fluctuation (e: the QED charge) is essential to extract the signal. Preliminary results for $m_p - m_n$ as well as other mass splittings are presented. Possible origin of systematic uncertainty is also discussed.",

This has been used by the MILC collaboration to create a large ensemble of lattices using which many quantities of physical interest have been and are being calculated. It is also used extensively in studies of QCD thermodynamics. The main question is whether the theory so defined has the correct continuum limit. There has been significant recent progress towards answering this question. After recalling the issue, and putting it into a broader context of results from statistical mechanics, I critically review the new work. I also address the related issue of the impact of treating valence and sea quarks differently in rooted simulations, discuss whether rooted simulations at finite temperature and density are subject to additional concerns, and briefly update results for quark masses using the MILC configurations. An answer to the question in the title is proposed in the summary.",

      "summary": "We use perturbative Symanzik improvement to create a new staggered-quark action (HISQ) that has greatly reduced one-loop taste-exchange errors, no tree-level order a^2 errors, and no tree-level order (am)^4 errors to leading order in the quark's velocity v/c. We demonstrate with simulations that the resulting action has taste-exchange interactions that are at least 3--4 times smaller than the widely used ASQTAD action. We show how to estimate errors due to taste exchange by comparing ASQTAD and HISQ simulations, and demonstrate with simulations that such errors are no more than 1% when HISQ is used for light quarks at lattice spacings of 1/10 fm or less. The suppression of (am)^4 errors also makes HISQ the most accurate discretization currently available for simulating c quarks. We demonstrate this in a new analysis of the psi-eta_c mass splitting using the HISQ action on lattices where a m_c=0.43 and 0.66, with full-QCD gluon configurations (from MILC). We obtain a result of~111(5) MeV which compares well with experiment. We discuss applications of this formalism to D physics and present our first high-precision results for D_s mesons.",

The Sp(2) gauge group, while allowing for the same set of center vortex fluxes as the SU(2) gauge group, induces a significantly different dynamics on those vortex fluxes, which manifests itself in a first-order deconfinement phase transition. As shown by the construction presented here, a new vortex effective action term which can be interpreted in terms of a vortex stickiness can be used to drive the deconfinement transition towards first-order behavior. The available data from lattice Sp(2) Yang-Mills theory are reproduced quantitatively and, in addition, predictions for the behavior of the spatial string tension at high temperatures are presented.",

These two theories contain the same center vortex degrees of freedom, and yet exhibit deconfinement phase transitions of different order. This is argued to be caused by the effective action governing the vortices being different in the two cases. To buttress this argument, a random vortex world-surface model is constructed which reproduces available lattice data characterizing Sp(2) Yang-Mills confinement properties. A new effective action term which can be interpreted in terms of a vortex stickiness serves to realize a first-order deconfinement phase transition, as found in Sp(2) Yang-Mills theory.

      "summary": "We present results for the pion multiplet spectrum calculated using both unimproved staggered fermions and improved HYP-smeared staggered fermions. In the case of unimproved staggered fermions, we observe (consistent with previous work) that ${\\cal O}(a^2)$ taste symmetry breaking effects are large and comparable to the $\\approx {\\cal O}(p^2)$ contributions to their masses. Higher order ${\\cal O}(a^2 p^2)$ effects are also substantial enough to be seen. For HYP-smeared staggered fermions, we find that taste breaking is much reduced. The ${\\cal O}(a^2)$ effects are observable, but are noticeably smaller than those obtained with AsqTad-improved staggered fermions, and much smaller than those obtained using unimproved staggered fermions, while ${\\cal O}(a^2 p^2)$ effects are suppressed to such a level that we cannot observe them given our statistical errors. From this numerical study, we conclude that HYP staggered fermions are significantly better that AsqTad fermions from the perspective of taste symmetry breaking.",

We present preliminary results for the pseudoscalar meson masses and decay constants from partially quenched simulations and examine the next-to-leading order chiral extrapolations at small quark masses. The simulations were carried out on two lattice volumes : $16^3\\times 32$ and $24^3\\times 64$, with the lattice spacing fixed at about 0.1 fm. The subtleties of the chiral fits are discussed. We also explore the roles of $m_{res}$ and $O(a)$ terms in the NLO chiral expansions and their effects on the chiral extrapolations for the pseudoscalar masses and decay constants.",

      "title": "D-branes, Wilson Bags, and Coherent Topological Charge Structure in QCD",
      "summary": "Monte Carlo studies of pure glue SU(3) gauge theory using the overlap-based topological charge operator have revealed a laminar structure in the QCD vacuum consisting of extended, thin, coherent, locally 3-dimensional sheets of topological charge embedded in 4D space, with opposite sign sheets interleaved. Studies of localization properties of Dirac eigenmodes have also shown evidence for the delocalization of low-lying modes on effectively 3-dimensional surfaces. In this talk, I review some theoretical ideas which suggest the possibility of 3-dimensionally coherent topological charge structure in 4-dimensional gauge theory and provide a possible interpretation of the observed structure. I begin with Luscher's ``Wilson bag'' integral over the 3-index Chern-Simons tensor. The analogy with a Wilson loop as a charged world line in 2-dimensional $CP^{N-1}$ sigma models suggests that the Wilson bag surface represents the world volume of a physical membrane. The large-N chiral Lagrangian arguments of Witten also indicate the existence of multiple ``k-vacuum'' states with discontinuous transitions between k-vacua at $θ=$ odd multiples of $π$. The domain walls between these vacua have the properties of a Wilson bag surface. Finally, I review the AdS/CFT duality view of $θ$ dependence in QCD. The dual realtionship between topological charge in gauge theory and Ramond-Ramond charge in type IIA string theory suggests that the coherent topological charge sheets observed on the lattice are the holographic image of wrapped D6 branes.",

Rooted staggered chiral perturbation theory describes the contributions from the pseudoscalar taste multiplets in terms of only a few low energy constants, which have all been previously determined by the MILC collaboration. In previous work one of us (Prelovsek) showed that the two-meson ``bubble'' contributions could explain the observed anomalies in the lattice data for the isovector a_0 channel. In the present work we extend this analysis to the f_0 channel. On a MILC collaboration lattice ensemble at 0.12 fm with 2+1 flavors of Asqtad-improved staggered fermions, we have made new measurements of correlators in both channels for a variety of momenta. A fit to these correlators gives low energy constants that are reasonably consistent with previous determinations by the MILC collaboration.}",

      "summary": "We report RBC and RBC/UKQCD lattice QCD numerical calculations of nucleon electroweak matrix elements with dynamical domain-wall fermions (DWF) quarks. The first, RBC, set of dynamical DWF ensembles employs two degenerate flavors of DWF quarks and the DBW2 gauge action. Three sea quark mass values of 0.04, 0.03 and 0.02 in lattice units are used with about 200 gauge configurations each. The lattice cutoff is about 1.7 GeV and the spatial volume is about (1.9 fm)^3. Despite the small volume, the ratio of the isovector vector and axial charges g_A/g_V and that of structure function moments <x>_{u-d}/<x>_{Delta u - Delta d} are in agreement with experiment, and show only very mild quark mass dependence. The second, RBC/UK, set of ensembles employs one strange and two degenerate (up and down) dynamical DWF quarks and Iwasaki gauge action. The strange quark mass is set at 0.04, and three up/down mass values of 0.03, 0.02 and 0.01 in lattice units are used. The lattice cutoff is about 1.6 GeV and the spatial volume is about (3.0 fm)^3. Even with preliminary statistics of 25-30 gauge configurations, the ratios g_A/g_V and <x>_{u-d}/<x>_{Delta u - Delta d} are consistent with experiment and show only very mild quark mass dependence. Another structure function moment, d_1, though yet to be renormalized, appears small in both sets.",

      "summary": "The notion of a non-perturbative effect is ambiguous if it requires the subtraction of a perturbative part defined by a diverging series. A common procedure consists in dropping the order of minimal contribution and the higher orders. This allows us to isolate very accurately the one-instanton effect for the double-well potential. For the one plaquette gauge theory, an exact analytical expression can be written for the non-perturbative part. We report recent attempts to extend this approach to the average plaquette of quenched QCD. Our goal is to express the non-perturbative effects in terms of expressions of the form beta^B exp(-A beta) calculable semi-classically. The situation is complicated by zeroes of the partition function in the complex $β$ plane (presumably near 5.75 pm i 0.2). We discuss two methods to describe the intermediate and large order behavior of the perturbative series. One is inspired by mean field theory (logarithmic specific heat) and reproduces accurately the known perturbative series with only two free parameters. A diagrammatic interpretation of this fact is still lacking. The other is based on infra-red renormalons with a factorial growth showing up at order larger than 20 and a possible effective theory interpretation. These extrapolations are compatible with the non-perturbative part of the plaquette being proportional to a^4. We propose an exponential parametrization to the corrections to the universal part of the beta function and find results compatible with the suggestion of a^2 corrections made by C. Allton.",

      "summary": "Moments of unpolarized, helicity, and transversity distributions, electromagnetic form factors, and generalized form factors of the nucleon are presented from a preliminary analysis of lattice results using pion masses down to 359 MeV. The twist two matrix elements are calculated using a mixed action of domain wall valence quarks and asqtad staggered sea quarks and are renormalized perturbatively. Several observables are extrapolated to the physical limit using chiral perturbation theory. Results are compared with experimental moments of quark distributions and electromagnetic form factors and phenomenologically determined generalized form factors, and the implications on the transverse structure and spin content of the nucleon are discussed.",

We show that this theory is non-local at non-zero lattice spacing $a$, and that the non-locality is caused by the breaking of taste symmetry at $a\\ne 0$. We then present a renormalization-group based argument that the theory restores taste symmetry in the continuum limit. As a consequence the theory is local in that limit, and falls into the correct universality class. Finally, we argue that the correct effective theory for the physics of Goldstone bosons at $a\\ne 0$ is given by staggered chiral perturbation theory with the replica trick.",

Operators used in the simulations include local operators and the simplest nonlocal operators that have nontrivial orbital structures. All operators are designed with the use of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the octahedral group so that they transform irreducibly under the group rotations. Matrices of correlation functions are computed for each irreducible representation, and then the variational method is applied to separate mass eigenstates. We obtained 17 states for isospin 1/2 and 11 states for isospin 3/2 in various spin-parity channels including $J^P=5/2^\\pm$. The pattern of the lowest-lying energies from each irrep is discussed.

In this paper we consider the 2-flavor Asqtad staggered action at a lattice spacing of approximately 0.13 fm and probe the properties of the staggered configurations by an overlap valence Dirac operator. By comparing the distribution of the overlap eigenmodes to continuum QCD predictions we investigate if/when the lattice artifacts are small as a function of the staggered quark mass. We define a matching overlap quark mass where the lattice corrections are minimal for the topological susceptibility and from the eigenmode distribution we predict the 2-flavor chiral condensate. Our results indicate that the staggered configurations are consistent with 2-flavor continuum QCD up to small lattice artifacts, and predict a consistent value for the infinite volume chiral condensate.",

      "summary": "An effective field theory exists describing a very large class of biophysically interesting Coulomb gas systems: the lowest order (mean-field) version of this theory takes the form of a generalized Poisson-Boltzmann theory. Interaction terms depend on details (finite-size effects, multipole properties, etc). Convergence of the loop expansion holds only if mutual interactions of mobile charges are small compared to their interaction with the fixed-charge environment, which is frequently not the case. Problems with the strongly- coupled effective theory can be circumvented with an alternative local lattice formulation, with real positive action. In realistic situations, with variable dielectric, a determinant of the Poisson operator must be inserted to generate correct electrostatics. Methods adopted from unquenched lattice QCD do this very efficiently.",

All the diagonal and mixed derivatives of pressure with respect to the quark number (proportional to baryon number) chemical potential ($μ_0$) and isospin chemical potential upto sixth order have been extracted at $μ_0 = μ_I = 0$. These derivatives give the generalized susceptibilities with respect to quark and isospin numbers. Similar estimates for the flavour diagonal and off-diagonal susceptibilities are also presented. Comparison to Lattice QCD (LQCD) data of some of these susceptibilities for which LQCD data are available, show similar temperature dependence, though there are some quantitative deviations above the crossover temperature. We have also looked at the effects of instanton induced flavour-mixing coming from the $U_A(1)$ chiral symmetry breaking 't Hooft determinant like term in the NJL part of the model. The diagonal quark number and isospin susceptibilities are completely unaffected. The off-diagonal susceptibilities show significant dependence near the crossover. Finally we present the chemical potential dependence of specific heat and speed of sound within the limits of chemical potentials where neither diquarks nor pions can condense.",

      "summary": "We consider 3-flavour lattice QCD with a finite chemical potential mu_I for isospin, close to the finite temperature transition from hadronic matter to a quark-gluon plasma. In this region one can argue that the position and probably the nature of this transition mimic those at finite quark-number chemical potential mu. The quark mass is chosen to be close to the critical mass at zero chemical potentials. Since the Binder cumulants used to determine the nature of this transition in HMD(R) simulations are very sensitive to the updating increment dt, we have switched to the newer exact RHMC algorithm for our simulations. Preliminary results indicate that there is no critical endpoint in the small mu_I regime, at least none connected with the critical point at zero chemical potentials.",

The scalar, pseudoscalar and axial vector diquarks are combined with light quarks to form color singlets. The scalar (\"good\") diquark channel shows a stronger attraction than the axial vector (\"bad\") channel in the quenched data set. The pseudoscalar diquark channel shows a finite volume zero mode artifact: the correlator becomes negative at large distance when the quark mass is small. By separating configurations without zero modes from those with zero modes, we found that the zero modes have an important contribution in both the attraction in the scalar channel and the repulsion in the pseudoscalar channel. In the axial vector diquark channel, we did not find apparent zero mode effects.",

      "summary": "The overlap fermion offers the considerable advantage of exact chiral symmetry on the lattice, but is numerically intensive. This can be made affordable while still providing large lattice volumes, by using coarse lattice spacing, given that good scaling and localization properties are established. Here, using overlap fermions on quenched Iwasaki gauge configurations, we demonstrate directly that, with appropriate choice of negative Wilson's mass, the overlap Dirac operator's range is comfortably small in lattice units for each of the lattice spacings 0.20 fm, 0.17 fm, and 0.13 fm (and scales to zero in physical units in the continuum limit). In particular, our direct results contradict recent speculation that an inverse lattice spacing of 1 GeV is too low to have satisfactory localization. Furthermore, hadronic masses (available on the two coarser lattices) scale very well.",

We match both the unrooted and rooted staggered determinants with an overlap fermion determinant of two (one) flavors and a local pure gauge effective action by fitting the coefficients of the effective action and the mass of the overlap operator. The residue of this fit measures the difference of the staggered and overlap fermion actions. We show that this residue scales at least as O(a^2), implying that any difference, be it local or non-local, between the staggered and overlap actions becomes irrelevant in the continuum limit. For the model under consideration here, this observation justifies the rooting procedure for the staggered sea quark action.",

We find that the resulting expression is similar to that in the continuum, and in fact has only two additional unknown parameters. At one-loop order, taste-symmetry violations in the staggered sea sector only contribute to flavor-disconnected diagrams by generating an O(a^2) shift to the masses of taste-singlet sea-sea mesons. Lattice discretization errors also give rise to an analytic term which shifts the tree-level value of B_K by an amount of O(a^2). This term, however, is not strictly due to taste-breaking, and is therefore also present in the expression for B_K for pure G-W lattice fermions. We also present a numerical study of the mixed B_K expression in order to demonstrate that both discretization errors and finite volume effects are small and under control on the MILC improved staggered lattices.",

For the anharmonic oscillator, the double-well potential and the single plaquette gauge theory, the non-perturbative part can be parametrized as A (lambda)^B exp{-C/lambda} and the coefficients can be calculated analytically. For lattice QCD in the quenched approximation, the perturbative series for the average plaquette is dominated at low order by a singularity in the complex coupling plane and the asymptotic behavior can only be reached by using extrapolations of the existing series. We discuss two extrapolations that provide a consistent description of the series up to order 20-25. These extrapolations favor the idea that the non-perturbative part scales like (a/r_0)^4 with a/r_0 defined with the force method. We discuss the large uncertainties associated with this statement. We propose a parametrization of ln((a/r_0)) as the two-loop universal terms plus a constant and exponential corrections. These corrections are consistent with a_{1-loop}^2 and play an important role when beta<6. We briefly discuss the possibility of calculating them semi-classically at large beta.",

This avoids the updating increment ($dt$) dependence of observables which plagues the Hybrid Molecular-dynamics (HMD) method. The RHMC algorithm uses rational approximations to fractional powers of the quadratic Dirac operator. Such approximations are only available when positive upper and lower bounds to the operator's spectrum are known. We apply the RHMC algorithm to simulations of 2 theories for which a positive lower spectral bound is unknown: lattice QCD with staggered quarks at finite isospin chemical potential and lattice QCD with massless staggered quarks and chiral 4-fermion interactions ($χ$QCD). A choice of lower bound is made in each case, and the properties of the RHMC simulations these define are studied. Justification of our choices of lower bounds is made by comparing measurements with those from HMD simulations, and by comparing different choices of lower bounds.",

Calculations with improved staggered fermions have been performed for various light to strange quark mass ratios in the range, 0.05 <= m_l/m_s <= 0.5, and with a strange quark mass fixed close to its physical value. From a combined extrapolation to the chiral (m_l -> 0) and continuum (aT = 1/N_t -> 0) limits we find for the transition temperature at the physical point T_c r_0 = 0.457(7) where the scale is set by the Sommer-scale parameter r_0 defined as the distance in the static quark potential at which the slope takes on the value, (dV_qq(r)/dr)_r=r_0 = 1.65/r_0^2. Using the currently best known value for r_0 this translates to a transition temperature T_c = 192(7)(4)MeV. The transition temperature in the chiral limit is about 3% smaller. We discuss current ambiguities in the determination of T_c in physical units and also comment on the universal scaling behavior of thermodynamic quantities in the chiral limit.",

      "summary": "We present a lattice calculation of the hadronic vacuum polarization and the lowest-order hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment, a_μ= (g-2)/2, using 2+1 flavors of improved staggered fermions. A precise fit to the low-q^2 region of the vacuum polarization is necessary to accurately extract the muon g-2. To obtain this fit, we use staggered chiral perturbation theory, including the vector particles as resonances, and compare these to polynomial fits to the lattice data. We discuss the fit results and associated systematic uncertainties, paying particular attention to the relative contributions of the pions and vector mesons. Using a single lattice spacing ensemble (a=0.086 fm), light quark masses as small as roughly one-tenth the strange quark mass, and volumes as large as (3.4 fm)^3, we find a_μ^{HLO} = (713 \\pm 15) \\times 10^{-10} and (748 \\pm 21) \\times 10^{-10} where the error is statistical only and the two values correspond to linear and quadratic extrapolations in the light quark mass, respectively. Considering systematic uncertainties not eliminated in this study, we view this as agreement with the current best calculations using the experimental cross section for e^+e^- annihilation to hadrons, 692.4 (5.9) (2.4)\\times 10^{-10}, and including the experimental decay rate of the tau lepton to hadrons, 711.0 (5.0) (0.8)(2.8)\\times 10^{-10}.

Where possible, we compare to existing lattice QCD calculations. In particular, we extend the heavy baryon Lagrangian to the next order in partially quenched chiral perturbation theory and use it to compute the masses of the lightest spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 baryons to next-to-next-to leading order. We then construct the twisted mass chiral Lagrangian for baryons and apply it to compute the lattice spacing corrections to the baryon masses simulated with twisted mass lattice QCD.\n  We extend computations of the nucleon electromagnetic structure to account for finite volume effects, as these observables are particularly sensitive to the finite extent of the lattice. We resolve subtle peculiarities for lattice QCD simulations of polarizabilities and we show that using background field techniques, one can make predictions for the 4 spin-dependent nucleon polarizabilities, quantities which are difficult to access experimentally.\n  We then discuss the two-pion system in finite volume, determining the exponentially small volume corrections necessary for lattice determinations of the scattering parameters. We also determine the lattice spacing artifacts that arise for a mixed-action lattice simulation of the two-pion system with Ginsparg-Wilson valence quarks and staggered sea quarks. We show that the isospin 2 scattering length has a near continuum like behavior, differing from the chiral perturbation theory calculation by a computable difference.",

The partition function of this model can be written elegantly as a statistical mechanics of dimers and baryonloops. The model is invariant under an $SO(3)\\times U(1)$ symmetry. At low temperatures we find evidence for superfluidity in the U(1) symmetry sector while the SO(3) symmetry remains unbroken. The finite temperature phase transition appears to belong to the Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class, but the superfluid density jump $ρ_s(T_c)$ at the critical temperature $T_c$ is anomalously higher than the normal value of $2 T_c/π$. We show that by adding a small SO(3) symmetry breaking term to the model, the superfluid density jump returns to its normal value implying that the extra symmetry causes anomalous superfluid behavior. Our results may be of interest to researchers studying superfluidity in spin-1 systems.",

These three parameters, $m_0$, $ζ$, and $c_B=c_E$ are obtained by matching finite-volume, heavy-heavy and heavy-light meson masses to the exact relativistic spectrum through a finite-volume, step-scaling recursion procedure. We demonstrate that accuracy on the level of a few percent can be achieved by carrying out this matching on a pair of lattices with equal physical spatial volumes but quite different lattice spacings. A fine lattice with inverse lattice spacing $1/a=5.4$ GeV and $24^3 \\times 48$ sites and a coarse, $1/a=3.6$ GeV, $16^3 \\times 32$ lattice are used together with a heavy quark mass $m$ approximately that of the charm quark. This approach is unable to determine the initially expected, four heavy-quark parameters: $m_0$, $ζ$, $c_B$ and $c_E$. This apparent non-uniqueness of these four parameters motivated the analytic result, presented in a companion paper, that this set is redundant and that the restriction $c_E=c_B$ is permitted through order $a|\\vec p|$ and to all orders in $m a$ where $\\vec p$ is the heavy quark's spatial momenta.",

The transition to this new form of matter as well as properties of the plasma phase are studied in large scale numerical calculations based on the theory of strong interactions - Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD). Experimentally properties of hot and dense elementary particle matter are studied in relativistic heavy ion collisions such as those currently performed at the relativistic heavy ion collider (RHIC) at BNL. We review here recent results from studies of thermodynamic properties of strongly interacting elementary particle matter performed on Teraflops-Computer. We present results on the QCD equation of state and discuss the status of studies of the phase diagram at non-vanishing baryon number density.",

      "summary": "We calculate the pi+ K+ scattering length in fully-dynamical lattice QCD with domain-wall valence quarks on MILC lattices with rooted staggered sea-quarks at a lattice spacing of b=0.125 fm, lattice spatial size of L =2.5 fm and at pion masses of m_pi=290, 350, 490 and 600 MeV. The lattice data, analyzed at next-to-leading order in chiral perturbation theory, allows an extraction of the full pi K scattering amplitude at threshold. Extrapolating to the physical point gives m_pi a_3/2 = -0.0574 (+- 0.0016)(+0.0024 -0.0058) and m_pi a_1/2 = 0.1725 (+- 0.0017)(+0.0023 -0.0156) for the I=3/2 and I=1/2 scattering lengths, respectively, where the first error is statistical and the second error is an estimate of the systematic due to truncation of the chiral expansion.",

      "title": "Charm as a domain wall fermion in quenched lattice QCD",
      "summary": "We report a study describing the charm quark by a domain-wall fermion (DWF) in lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Our study uses a quenched gauge ensemble with the DBW2 rectangle-improved gauge action at a lattice cutoff of $a^{-1} \\sim 3$ GeV. We calculate masses of heavy-light (charmed) and heavy-heavy (charmonium) mesons with spin-parity $J^P = 0^\\mp$ and $1^\\mp$, leptonic decay constants of the charmed pseudoscalar mesons ($D$ and $D_s$), and the $D^0$-$\\bar{D^0}$ mixing parameter. The charm quark mass is found to be $m^{\\bar{\\rm MS}}_{c}(m_{c})=1.24(1)(18)$ GeV. The mass splittings in charmed-meson parity partners $Δ_{q,J=0}$ and $Δ_{q, J=1}$ are degenerate within statistical errors, in accord with experiment, and they satisfy a relation $Δ_{q=ud, J} > Δ_{q=s, J}$, also consistent with experiment. A C-odd axial vector charmonium state, $h_c), lies 22(11) MeV above the $χ_{c1}$ meson, or $m_{h_{c}} = 3533(11)_{\\rm stat.}$ MeV using the experimental $χ_{c1}) mass. However, in this regard, we emphasize significant discrepancies in the calculation of hyperfine splittings on the lattice. The leptonic decay constants of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are found to be $f_D=232(7)_{\\rm stat.}(^{+6}_{-0})_{\\rm chiral}(11)_{\\rm syst.}$ MeV and $f_{D_s}/f_{D} = 1.05(2)_{\\rm stat.}(^{+0}_{-2})_{\\rm chiral}(2)_{\\rm syst.}$, where the first error is statistical, the second a systematic due to chiral extrapolation and the third error combination of other known systematics. The $D^0$-$\\bar{D^0}$ mixing bag parameter, which enters the $ΔC = 2$ transition amplitude, is found to be $B_D(2{GeV})=0.845(24)_{\\rm stat.}(^{+24}_{-6})_{\\rm chiral}(105)_{\\rm syst.}$.",

      "summary": "We propose the formulation of lattice QCD wherein all elements of the theory (gauge action, fermionic action, theta-term, and all operators) are constructed from a single object, namely the lattice Dirac operator D with exact chiral symmetry. Several regularizations of this type are suggested via constructing scalar densities (gauge actions) that are explicit functions of D. The simplest of these is based on the proposition that classical limit of density associated with Tr D is (up to an additive constant) proportional to FF, while the corresponding operator is local. The possibilities of explicit interrelations between gauge and fermionic aspects of the theory are emphasized together with the utility of such formulations for exploring the QCD vacuum structure.",

      "summary": "The anomalous scaling behavior of the topological susceptibility $χ_t$ in two-dimensional $CP^{N-1}$ sigma models for $N\\leq 3$ is studied using the overlap Dirac operator construction of the lattice topological charge density. The divergence of $χ_t$ in these models is traced to the presence of small instantons with a radius of order $a$ (= lattice spacing), which are directly observed on the lattice. The observation of these small instantons provides detailed confirmation of Lüscher's argument that such short-distance excitations, with quantized topological charge, should be the dominant topological fluctuations in $CP^1$ and $CP^2$, leading to a divergent topological susceptibility in the continuum limit. For the $\\CP$ models with $N>3$ the topological susceptibility is observed to scale properly with the mass gap. These larger $N$ models are not dominated by instantons, but rather by coherent, one-dimensional regions of topological charge which can be interpreted as domain wall or Wilson line excitations and are analogous to D-brane or ``Wilson bag'' excitations in QCD. In Lorentz gauge, the small instantons and Wilson line excitations can be described, respectively, in terms of poles and cuts of an analytic gauge potential.",

The lattice formulation we employ was derived in \\cite{sigma1} and corresponds to a discretization of a {\\it twisted} form of the continuum action. The twisting process exposes a {\\it nilpotent} supercharge $Q$ and allows the action to be rewritten in $Q$-exact form. These properties may be maintained on the lattice. We show how to deform the theory by the addition of potential terms which preserve the supersymmetry. A Wilson mass operator may be introduced in this way with a minimal breaking of supersymmetry. We additionally show how to rewrite the theory in the language of Kähler-Dirac fields and explain why this avenue does not provide a good route to discretization. Our numerical results provide strong evidence for a restoration of full supersymmetry in the continuum limit {\\it without} fine tuning. We also observe a non-vanishing chiral condensate as expected from continuum instanton calculations.",

Here we describe a typical lattice QCD calculation by examining our recent computation of the nucleon axial charge.",

      "summary": "Hadronic matrix elements of operators relevant to nucleon decay in grand unified theories are calculated numerically using lattice QCD. In this context, the domain-wall fermion formulation, combined with non-perturbative renormalization, is used for the first time. These techniques bring reduction of a large fraction of the systematic error from the finite lattice spacing. Our main effort is devoted to a calculation performed in the quenched approximation, where the direct calculation of the nucleon to pseudoscalar matrix elements, as well as the indirect estimate of them from the nucleon to vacuum matrix elements, are performed. First results, using two flavors of dynamical domain-wall quarks for the nucleon to vacuum matrix elements are also presented to address the systematic error of quenching, which appears to be small compared to the other errors. Our results suggest that the representative value for the low energy constants from the nucleon to vacuum matrix elements are given as |alpha| simeq |beta| simeq 0.01 GeV^3. For a more reliable estimate of the physical low energy matrix elements, it is better to use the relevant form factors calculated in the direct method. The direct method tends to give smaller value of the form factors, compared to the indirect one, thus enhancing the proton life-time; indeed for the pi^0 final state the difference between the two methods is quite appreciable.",

Using quenched DWF simulations I show that the eigenvalue spectrum of the transfer matrix Hamiltonian develops a substantial gap and that the residual mass decreases appreciatively. Furthermore, I confirm that topology changing remains active and that the hadron spectrum of the added Wilson fermions is above the lattice cutoff and therefore is irrelevant. I argue that this result should also hold for dynamical DWF and furthermore that it should improve the chiral properties of related fermion methods.",

The method generalizes that used to study the spectrum of the Dirac operator in the continuum, and uses partially quenched chiral perturbation theory for Wilson fermions. The leading-order corrections are proportional to a^2 (a being the lattice spacing). At this order I find that the method works only for one choice of sign of one of the three low energy constants describing discretization errors. If these constants have the relative magnitudes expected from large N_c arguments, then the method works if the theory has an Aoki phase for m of order a^2, but fails if there is a first-order transition. In the former case, the dependence of the gap and the spectral density on m and a^2 are determined. In particular, the gap is found to vanish more quickly as m_pi^2-> 0 than in the continuum. This reduces the region where simulations are safe from fluctuations in the gap.",

The effect of resummation is to replace various parameters in the action (coupling constant, Symanzik coefficients, clover coefficient) by ``dressed'' values; the latter are solutions to certain coupled integral equations, which are easy to solve numerically.\n  Some positive features of this method are: a) It is gauge invariant, b) it can be systematically applied to improve (to all orders) results obtained at any given order in perturbation theory, c) it does indeed absorb in the dressed parameters the bulk of tadpole contributions.\n  Two different applications are presented: The additive renormalization of fermion masses, and the multiplicative renormalization Z_V (Z_A) of the vector (axial) current. In many cases where non-perturbative estimates of renormalization functions are also available for comparison, the agreement with improved perturbative results is significantly better as compared to results from bare perturbation theory.",

      "summary": "For compact U(1) lattice gauge theory (LGT) we have performed a finite size scaling analysis on $N_τ N_s^3$ lattices for $N_τ$ fixed by extrapolating spatial volumes of size $N_s\\le 18$ to $N_s\\to\\infty$. Within the numerical accuracy of the thus obtained fits we find for $N_τ=4$, 5 and~6 second order critical exponents, which exhibit no obvious $N_τ$ dependence. The exponents are consistent with 3d Gaussian values, but not with either first order transitions or the universality class of the 3d XY model. As the 3d Gaussian fixed point is known to be unstable, the scenario of a yet unidentified non-trivial fixed point close to the 3d Gaussian emerges as one of the possible explanations.",

We also provide leading chiral order results for the matrix elements of the electroweak penguin operators which give the dominant ΔI=3/2 contribution to direct CP violation in K->ππdecays. Our calculations were performed with Neuberger fermions on two sets of quenched Wilson gauge configurations at inverse lattice spacings of approximately 2.2 GeV and 1.5 GeV. All renormalizations were implemented non-perturbatively in the RI/MOM scheme, where we accounted for sub-leading operator product expansion corrections and discretization errors. We find ratios of non-SM to SM matrix elements which are roughly twice as large as in the only other dedicated lattice study of these amplitudes. On the other hand, our results for the electroweak penguin matrix elements are in good agreement with two recent domain-wall fermion calculations. As a by-product of our study, we determine the strange quark mass. Our main results are summarized and discussed in Sec. VII. Within our statistics, we find no evidence for scaling violations.",

At the physical value of the pion mass, we predict M_n - M_p |(d-u) = 2.26 +- 0.57 +- 0.42 +- 0.10 MeV where the first error is statistical, the second error is due to the uncertainty in the ratio of light-quark masses, eta=m_u/m_d, determined by MILC, and the third error is an estimate of the systematic due to chiral extrapolation.",

      "title": "A Framework for Systematic Study of QCD Vacuum Structure I: Kolmogorov Entropy and the Principle of Chiral Ordering",
      "summary": "In this series of articles we describe a systematic approach to studying QCD vacuum structure using the methods of lattice gauge theory. Our framework incorporates four major components. (i) The recently established existence of space-time order at all scales (fundamental structure) observed directly in typical configurations of regularized path-integral ensembles. (ii) The notion of scale-dependent vacuum structure (effective structure) providing the means for representing and quantifying the influence of fluctuations at various scales on physical observables (phenomena). (iii) The unified description of gauge and fermionic aspects of the theory which facilitates a high level of space-time order in the path-integral ensembles. (iv) The strict ``Bottom-Up'' approach wherein the process of identifying the vacuum structure proceeds inductively, using the information from valid lattice QCD ensembles as the only input. In this work we first elaborate on the meaning of the notion of space-time order in a given configuration which is conceptually at the heart of the path-integral approach to vacuum structure. It is argued that the algorithmic complexity of binary strings associated with coarse-grained descriptions of the configuration provides a relevant quantitative measure. The corresponding ensemble averages define the ranking of different lattice theories at given cutoff by the degree of space-time order generated via their dynamics. We then introduce the set of local transformations of a configuration, chiral orderings, in which the transformed gauge connection represents an effective matrix phase acquired by chiral fermion when hopping over a given link. It is proposed that chiral orderings facilitate the evolution in the set of actions which increases the degree of space-time order while preserving the physical content of the theory, and should thus be used in the search for the fundamental QCD vacuum structure. The relation to renormalization group ideas is discussed, and the first step in general formulation of effective lattice QCD realizing the notion of scale-dependent vacuum structure is given.",

I specialize to a particularly interesting (4,4) gauge theory, with gauge group U(N_c) \\times U(N_f), and U(N_f) weakly gauged. It describes the infrared limit of the D1/D5 brane system, which has been studied extensively as an example of the AdS_3/CFT_2 correspondence. The construction here preserves two supercharges exactly, and has a lattice structure quite similar to that which has previously appeared in the deconstruction approach; i.e., site, link and diagonal fields with both Bose and Fermi statistics. I remark on possible applications of the lattice theory that would test the AdS_3/CFT_2 correspondence, particularly one that would exploit the recent worldsheet instanton analysis of Chen and Tong [hep-th/0604090].",

      "summary": "Motivated by questions about the QCD deconfining phase transition, we studied in two previous papers Model A (Glauber) dynamics of 2D and 3D Potts models, focusing on structure factor evolution under heating (heating in the gauge theory notation, i.e., cooling of the spin systems). In the present paper we set for 3D Potts models (Ising and 3-state) the scale of the dynamical effects by comparing to equilibrium results at first and second order phase transition temperatures, obtained by re-weighting from a multicanonical ensemble. Our finding is that the dynamics entirely overwhelms the critical and non-critical equilibrium effects.\n  In the second half of the paper we extend our results by investigating the Glauber dynamics of pure SU(3) lattice gauge on $N_τ N_σ^3$ lattices directly under heating quenches from the confined into the deconfined regime. The exponential growth factors of the initial response are calculated, which give Debye screening mass estimates. The quench leads to competing vacuum domains of distinct $Z_3$ triality, which delay equilibration of pure gauge theory forever, while their role in full QCD remains a subtle question. As in spin systems we find for pure SU(3) gauge theory a dynamical growth of structure factors, reaching maxima which scale approximately with the volume of the system, before settling down to equilibrium. Their influence on various observables is studied and different lattice sizes are simulated to illustrate an approach to a finite volume continuum limit. Strong correlations are found during the dynamical process, but not in the deconfined phase at equilibrium.",

      "summary": "We show that the use of the fourth-root trick in lattice QCD with staggered fermions corresponds to a non-local theory at non-zero lattice spacing, but argue that the non-local behavior is likely to go away in the continuum limit. We give examples of this non-local behavior in the free theory, and for the case of a fixed topologically non-trivial background gauge field. In both special cases, the non-local behavior indeed disappears in the continuum limit. Our results invalidate a recent claim that at non-zero lattice spacing an additive mass renormalization is needed because of taste-symmetry breaking.",

We match both the unrooted and rooted staggered determinant with an overlap fermion determinant of two (one) flavors and a local pure gauge effective action by fitting the coefficients of the effective action and the mass of the overlap operator. The residue of this fit measures the difference of the staggered and overlap fermion actions. We show that this residue scales at least as O(a^2), implying that any difference, be it local or non-local, between the staggered and overlap actions becomes irrelevant in the continuum limit.

      "summary": "We simulate lattice QCD with 2 flavours of massless quarks on lattices of temporal extent N_t=8, to study the finite temperature transition from hadronic matter to a quark-gluon plasma. A modified action which incorporates an irrelevant chiral 4-fermion interaction is used, which allows simulations at zero quark mass. We obtain excellent fits of the chiral condensates to the magnetizations of a 3-dimensional O(2) spin model on lattices small enough to model the finite size effects. This gives predictions for correlation lengths and chiral susceptibilities from the corresponding spin-model quantities. These are in good agreement with our measurements over the relevant range of parameters. Binder cumulants are measured, but the errors are too large to draw definite conclusions. From the properties of the O(2) spin model on the relatively small lattices with which we fit our `data', we can see why earlier attempts to fit staggered lattice data to leading-order infinite-volume scaling functions, as well as finite size scaling studies, failed and led to erroneous conclusions.",

Most analyses of this theory have been limited to studying it as a classical field theory. We quantize this theory on a Euclidean 4-dimensional space-time lattice and determine its properties using Monte-Carlo simulations. The electromagnetic field around a static point charge is measured using Luscher-Weisz methods to overcome the sign problem associated with the introduction of this charge. The D field appears identical to that of Maxwell QED. However, the E field is enhanced by quantum fluctuations, while still showing the short distance screening observed in the classical theory. In addition, whereas for the classical theory, the screening increases without bound as the non-linearity increases, the quantum theory approaches a limiting conformal field theory.",

      "title": "The Pomeron and Gauge/String Duality",
      "summary": "The traditional description of high-energy small-angle scattering in QCD has two components -- a soft Pomeron Regge pole for the tensor glueball, and a hard BFKL Pomeron in leading order at weak coupling. On the basis of gauge/string duality, we present a coherent treatment of the Pomeron. In large-N QCD-like theories, we use curved-space string-theory to describe simultaneously both the BFKL regime and the classic Regge regime. The problem reduces to finding the spectrum of a single j-plane Schrodinger operator. For ultraviolet-conformal theories, the spectrum exhibits a set of Regge trajectories at positive t, and a leading j-plane cut for negative t, the cross-over point being model-dependent. For theories with logarithmically-running couplings, one instead finds a discrete spectrum of poles at all t, where the Regge trajectories at positive t continuously become a set of slowly-varying and closely-spaced poles at negative t. Our results agree with expectations for the BFKL Pomeron at negative t, and with the expected glueball spectrum at positive t, but provide a framework in which they are unified. Effects beyond the single Pomeron exchange are briefly discussed.",

      "title": "Staggered Chiral Perturbation Theory and the Fourth-Root Trick",
      "summary": "Staggered chiral perturbation theory (schpt) takes into account the \"fourth-root trick\" for reducing unwanted (taste) degrees of freedom with staggered quarks by multiplying the contribution of each sea quark loop by a factor of 1/4. In the special case of four staggered fields (four flavors, nF=4), I show here that certain assumptions about analyticity and phase structure imply the validity of this procedure for representing the rooting trick in the chiral sector. I start from the observation that, when the four flavors are degenerate, the fourth root simply reduces nF=4 to nF=1. One can then treat nondegenerate quark masses by expanding around the degenerate limit. With additional assumptions on decoupling, the result can be extended to the more interesting cases of nF=3, 2, or 1. A apparent paradox associated with the one-flavor case is resolved. Coupled with some expected features of unrooted staggered quarks in the continuum limit, in particular the restoration of taste symmetry, schpt then implies that the fourth-root trick induces no problems (for example, a violation of unitarity that persists in the continuum limit) in the lowest energy sector of staggered lattice QCD. It also says that the theory with staggered valence quarks and rooted staggered sea quarks behaves like a simple, partially-quenched theory, not like a \"mixed\" theory in which sea and valence quarks have different lattice actions. In most cases, the assumptions made in this paper are not only sufficient but also necessary for the validity of schpt, so that a variety of possible new routes for testing this validity are opened.",

We find evidence that the model undergoes a weak first order phase transition at $μ=0$ which becomes second order at a finite $μ$. Symmetry considerations suggest that the universality class of these phase transitions should be governed by an $O(N)\\times O(2)$ field theory with collinear order, with N=3 at $μ=0$ and N=2 at $μ\\neq 0$. The universality class of the second order phase transition at $μ\\neq 0$ appears to be governed by the decoupled XY fixed point present in the $O(2)\\times O(2)$ field theory. Finally we show that the quantum (T=0) phase transition as a function of $μ$ is a second order mean field transition.",

The essential reason for the complex phase problem of the fermion determinant is shown to be derivative interactions that are not present in the continuum. These irrelevant operators violate the self-conjugacy of the fermion action that is present in the continuum. It is explained why this complex phase problem does not disappear in the continuum limit. The fermion determinant suppression of various branches of the classical moduli space is explored, and found to be supportive of previous claims regarding the continuum limit.",

The extraction of excited-state energies necessitates the evaluation of correlation matrices of sets of operators, and the importance of extended three-quark operators to capture both the radial and orbital structures of baryons is emphasized. The use of both quark-field smearing and link-field smearing in the operators is essential for reducing the couplings of the operators to the high-frequency modes and for reducing statistical noise in the correlators.

      "title": "Radiative Transitions in Charmonium from Lattice QCD",
      "summary": "Radiative transitions between charmonium states offer an insight into the internal structure of heavy-quark bound states within QCD. We compute, for the first time within lattice QCD, the transition form-factors of various multipolarities between the lightest few charmonium states. In addition, we compute the experimentally unobservable, but physically interesting vector form-factors of the $η_c, J/ψ$ and $χ_{c0}$.\n  To this end we apply an ambitious combination of lattice techniques, computing three-point functions with heavy domain wall fermions on an anisotropic lattice within the quenched approximation. With an anisotropy $ξ=3$ at $a_s \\sim 0.1 \\mathrm{fm}$ we find a reasonable gross spectrum and a hyperfine splitting $\\sim 90 \\mathrm{MeV}$, which compares favourably with other improved actions.\n  In general, after extrapolation of lattice data at non-zero $Q^2$ to the photopoint, our results agree within errors with all well measured experimental values. Furthermore, results are compared with the expectations of simple quark models where we find that many features are in agreement; beyond this we propose the possibility of constraining such models using our extracted values of physically unobservable quantities such as the $J/ψ$ quadrupole moment.\n  We conclude that our methods are successful and propose to apply them to the problem of radiative transitions involving hybrid mesons, with the eventual goal of predicting hybrid meson photoproduction rates at the GlueX experiment.",

      "title": "B Meson Semileptonic Form Factors from Unquenched Lattice QCD",
      "summary": "The semileptonic process, B --> πl ν, is studied via full QCD Lattice simulations. We use unquenched gauge configurations generated by the MILC collaboration. These include the effect of vacuum polarization from three quark flavors: the $s$ quark and two very light flavors ($u/d$) of variable mass allowing extrapolations to the physical chiral limit. We employ Nonrelativistic QCD to simulate the $b$ quark and a highly improved staggered quark action for the light sea and valence quarks. We calculate the form factors $f_+(q^2)$ and $f_0(q^2)$ in the chiral limit for the range 16 GeV$^2 \\leq q^2 < q^2_{max}$ and obtain $\\int^{q^2_{max}}_{16 GeV^2} [dΓ/dq^2] dq^2 / |v_{ub}|^2 = 1.46(35) ps^{-1}$. Combining this with a preliminary average by the Heavy Flavor Averaging Group (HFAG'05) of recent branching fraction data for exclusive B semileptonic decays from the BaBar, Belle and CLEO collaborations, leads to $|V_{ub}| = 4.22(30)(51) \\times 10^{-3}$. PLEASE NOTE APPENDIX B with an ERRATUM, to appear in Physical Review D, to the published version of this e-print (Phys.Rev.D 73, 074502 (2006)). Results for the form factor $f_+(q^2)$ in the chiral limit have changed significantly. The last two sentences in this abstract should now read; \"We calculate the form factor $f_+(q^2)$ and $f_0(q^2)$ in the chiral limit for the range 16 Gev$^2 \\leq q^2 < q^2_{max}$ and obtain $\\int^{q^2_{max}}_{16 GeV^2} [dΓ/dq^2] dq^2 / |V_{ub}|^2 = 2.07(57)ps^{-1}$. Combining this with a preliminary average by the Heavy Flavor Averagibg Group (HFAG'05) of recent branching fraction data for exclusive B semileptonic decays from the BaBar, Belle and CLEO collaborations, leads to $|V_{ub}| = 3.55(25)(50) \\times 10^{-3}$.\"",
