      "summary": "We present results on the electroweak form factors and on the lower moments of parton distributions of the nucleon, within lattice QCD using two dynamical flavors of degenerate twisted mass fermions. Results are obtained on lattices with three different values of the lattice spacings, namely a=0.089 fm, a=0.070 fm and a=0.056 fm, allowing the investigation of cut-off effects. The volume dependence is examined by comparing results on two lattices of spatial length L=2.1 fm and L=2.8 fm. The simulations span pion masses in the range of 260-470 MeV. Our results are renormalized non-perturbatively and the values are given in the MS-scheme at a scale mu=2 GeV.",

Preliminary results for hadronic mixing matrix elements are given for a basis of five four-quark, dimension-six, $ΔB=2$ mixing operators that spans the space of all possible hadronic mixing contributions in the Standard Model and beyond. At the intermediate stage of analysis reported on in this work, our errors are competitive with published Standard Model matrix element results.

      "summary": "Recently a class of supersymmetric gauge theories have been successfully implemented on the lattice. However, there has been an ongoing debate on whether lattice versions of some of these theories suffer from a sign problem, with independent simulations for the ${\\cal N} = (2, 2)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in two dimensions yielding seemingly contradictory results. Here, we address this issue from an interesting theoretical point of view. We conjecture that the sign problem observed in some of the simulations is related to the so called Neuberger 0/0 problem, which arises in ordinary non-supersymmetric lattice gauge theories, and prevents the realization of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin symmetry on the lattice. After discussing why we expect a sign problem in certain classes of supersymmetric lattice gauge theories far from the continuum limit, we argue that these problems can be evaded by use of a non-compact parametrization of the gauge link fields.",

We use the publicly-available 2+1 flavor MILC asqtad-improved staggered gauge configurations with multiple light sea-quark masses and three lattice spacings, and compute the kaon mixing matrix element with several partially-quenched valence-quark masses. We then extrapolate to the physical light-quark masses and the continuum using partially-quenched chiral perturbation theory formulated for mixed-action lattice simulations. For B_K we match the lattice four-fermion operator to the continuum using the nonperturbative method of Rome-Southampton. Our new results benefit from two significant improvements over our published work: (1) we have added a third lattice spacing of a~0.06 fm to better control the continuum extrapolation, and (2) we have implemented a new lattice renormalization scheme (the RI/SMOM_{gamma_mu} scheme developed by Sturm et al.) that suppresses chiral-symmetry breaking and other infrared effects and, in practice, also shrinks the size of the 1-loop perturbative coefficient needed to match to the continuum MS-bar scheme. When combined with the use of volume-averaged momentum sources and twisted-boundary conditions, this significantly reduces the systematic uncertainty in the renormalization factor Z_{B_K}.",

In case of re-weighting the sea quark mass, the re-weighting factor is given by the ratio of the determinants of two Dirac operators $D_a$ and $D_b$. A popular approach for computing this ratio is to use a pseudofermion representation of the determinant of the composite operator $Ω=D_a(D_b^\\dagger D_b)^{-1} D_a^\\dagger$. Here, we study using quadrature methods together with noise vectors to compute the ratio of determinants. We show that, with quadrature methods each determinant can be computed separately using the operators $Ω_a=D_a^\\dagger D_a$ and $Ω_b=D_b^\\dagger D_b$. We also discuss using bootstrap re-sampling to remove the bias from the determinant estimator.",

      "summary": "In the low energy effective theory describing the partially quenched extension of two light Wilson fermions, three low energy constants (LECs) appear in terms proportional to a^2 (a being the lattice spacing). We propose methods to separately calculate these LECs, typically called W'_6, W'_7 and W'_8. While only one linear combination of these constants enters into physical quantities, different combinations enter into the description of the spectral density and eigenvalue distributions of the lattice Dirac operator and its Hermitian counterpart. Thus it is useful to be able to determine the LECs separately. Our methods require studying certain correlation functions for either two or three pion scattering, which are accessible only in the partially quenched extension of the theory.",

In addition, we give error projections for a new analysis in progress, based on an extended data set.",

      "title": "On the sign problem in 2D lattice super Yang--Mills",
      "summary": "In recent years a new class of supersymmetric lattice theories have been proposed which retain one or more exact supersymmetries for non-zero lattice spacing. Recently there has been some controversy in the literature concerning whether these theories suffer from a sign problem. In this paper we address this issue by conducting simulations of the N=(2, 2) and N=(8, 8) supersymmetric Yang--Mills theories in two dimensions for the U(N) theories with N=2,3,4, using the new twisted lattice formulations. Our results provide evidence that these theories do not suffer from a sign problem in the continuum limit. These results thus boost confidence that the new lattice formulations can be used successfully to explore non-perturbative aspects of four-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory.",

We compute the heavy-light meson correlation functions on the MILC asqtad-improved staggered gauge configurations which include the effects of three light dynamical sea quarks. We simulate with several values of the light valence- and sea-quark masses (down to ~m_s/10) and at three lattice spacings (a ~ 0.15, 0.12, and 0.09 fm) and extrapolate to the physical up and down quark masses and the continuum using expressions derived in heavy-light meson staggered chiral perturbation theory. We renormalize the heavy-light axial current using a mostly nonperturbative method such that only a small correction to unity must be computed in lattice perturbation theory and higher-order terms are expected to be small. We obtain f_{B^+} = 196.9(8.9) MeV, f_{B_s} = 242.0(9.5) MeV, f_{D^+} = 218.9(11.3) MeV, f_{D_s} = 260.1(10.8) MeV, and the SU(3) flavor-breaking ratios f_{B_s}/f_{B} = 1.229(26) and f_{D_s}/f_{D} = 1.188(25), where the numbers in parentheses are the total statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature.",

Recently, we argued that they act as gates or separatrices for complex RG flows. Using histogram reweighting to construct the density of states, we calculate the Fisher's zeros for pure gauge SU(2) and U(1) on L^4 lattices. For SU(2), these zeros appear to move almost horizontally when the volume increases. They stay away from the real axis which indicates a confining theory at zero temperature. We discuss the effect of an adjoint term on these results. In contrast, using recent multicanonical simulations for the U(1) model for L up to 8 we find that the zeros pinch the real axis near beta =1.0113. Preliminary results concerning U(1) at larger volumes, SU(3) with 3 light flavors and plans to delimit the boundary of the conformal window are briefly discussed.",

Knowing the Standard Model inputs to nucleon matrix elements will be necessary to constrain the couplings of dark matter candidates such as the neutralino, to relate the neutron electric dipole moment to the CP-violating theta parameter, or to search for new TeV-scale particles though non-$V-A$ interactions in neutron beta decay. However, these matrix elements derive from the properties of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at low energies, where the coupling is strong and thus perturbative treatments fail. Using lattice gauge theory, we can nonperturbatively calculate the QCD path integral on a supercomputer.\n  In this proceeding, I will review a few representative areas in which lattice QCD can contribute to understanding the structure inside nucleon and how they can contribute to the search for beyond-the-Standard Model physics, with discussions of the difficulties and prospects for future development.",

      "summary": "We compute nucleon and Roper e.m. elastic and transition form factors using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a contact-interaction. Obtained thereby, the e.m. interactions of baryons are typically described by hard form factors. In contrasting this behaviour with that produced by a momentum-dependent interaction, one achieves comparisons which highlight that elastic scattering and resonance electroproduction experiments probe the infrared evolution of QCD's running masses; e.g., the existence, and location if so, of a zero in the ratio of nucleon Sachs form factors are strongly influenced by the running of the dressed-quark mass. In our description of baryons, diquark correlations are important. These correlations are instrumental in producing a zero in the Dirac form factor of the proton's d-quark; and in determining d_v/u_v(x=1), as we show via a formula that expresses d_v/u_v(x=1) in terms of the nucleon's diquark content. The contact interaction produces a first excitation of the nucleon that is constituted predominantly from axial-vector diquark correlations. This impacts greatly on the gamma*p->P_{11}(1440) form factors. Notably, our quark core contribution to F_2*(Q^2) exhibits a zero at Q^2~0.5mN^2. Faddeev equation treatments of a hadron's quark core usually underestimate its magnetic properties, hence we consider the effect produced by a dressed-quark anomalous e.m. moment. Its inclusion much improves agreement with experiment. On the domain 0<Q^2<2GeV^2, meson-cloud effects are important in making a realistic comparison between experiment and hadron structure calculations. Our computed helicity amplitudes are similar to the bare amplitudes in coupled-channels analyses of the electroproduction process. Thus supports a view that extant structure calculations should directly be compared with the bare-couplings, etc., determined via coupled-channels analyses.",

We computed low-lying eigenvalues for the Hermitian Wilson-Dirac operator and for improved staggered fermions on several quenched ensembles with size $\\approx 1.5$ fm. Comparisons to the expectations from RMT with lattice effects included are made. Wilson RMT describes our Wilson data nicely.

      "summary": "We use Monte Carlo simulation to probe the phase structure of a SU(2) gauge theory containing $N_f$ Dirac fermion flavors transforming in the fundamental representation of the group and interacting through an additional four fermion term. Pairs of physical flavors are implemented using the two tastes present in a reduced staggered fermion formulation of the theory. The resultant lattice theory is invariant under a set of shift symmetries which correspond to a discrete subgroup of the continuum chiral-flavor symmetry. The pseudoreal character of the representation guarantees that the theory has no sign problem. For the case of $N_f=4$ we observe a crossover in the behavior of the chiral condensate for strong four fermi coupling associated with the generation of a dynamical mass for the fermions. At weak gauge coupling this crossover is consistent with the usual continuous phase transition seen in the pure (ungauged) NJL model. However, if the gauge coupling is strong enough to cause confinement we observe a much more rapid crossover in the chiral condensate consistent with a first order phase transition",

The basic idea is to identify unpaired fermionic degrees of freedom that cause sign problems and collect them in a bag. Paired fermions usually act like bosons and do not lead to sign problems. A resummation of all unpaired fermion degrees of freedom inside the bag is sufficient to solve the fermion sign problem in a variety of interesting cases. Using a concept of duality we then argue that the size of the fermion bags is small both at strong and weak couplings. This allows us to construct efficient algorithms in both these limits. Using the fermion bag approach, we study the quantum phase transition of the 3D massless lattice Thirrring model which is of interest in the context of Graphene. Using our method we are able to solve the model on lattices as large as $40^3$ with moderate computational resources. We obtain the precise location of the quantum critical point and the values of the critical exponents through this study.",

We find modest speed-ups (\\sim 20%) from using the force gradient integrator, compared to our previously used Omelyan integrator. On other ensembles, primarily finite temperature 2+1 flavor DWF QCD, we have extensively tuned the Hasenbusch preconditioning masses and achieved speed-ups of 2-3x. Here we have also switched to the force gradient integrator, but this change has not had any impact on the speed. We also report on an improved solver for DWF, which uses Möbius fermions, with a smaller fifth dimension than the original DWF fermions, as an intermediate step in the generation of solutions of the Dirac equation. This approach cuts the number of effective Dirac applications by approximately a factor of 2 when the conjugate gradient iteration count is large.",

      "summary": "We present an approach for computing the real parts of the nonleptonic B to DP and B to D-bar P (P=K,pi) decay amplitudes by using lattice QCD methods. While it remains very challenging to calculate the imaginary parts of these matrix elements on the lattice, we stress that their real parts play a significant role in extracting the angle gamma in the b-d unitarity triangle of the CKM matrix. The real part on its own gives a lower bound to the absolute magnitude of the amplitude which is in itself an important constraint for determining gamma. Also the relevant phase can be obtained by using B-decays in conjunction with relevant charm decay data. Direct four-point function calculations on the lattice, while computationally demanding, does yield the real part as that is not impeded by the Maiani-Testa theorem. As an approximation, we argue that the chiral expansion of these decays is valid in a framework similar to that of hard-pion chiral perturbation theory. In addition to constructing the leading-order operators, we also discuss the features of the next-to-leading order chiral expansion. These include the contributions from the resonance states, as well as the generic forms of the chiral logarithms.",

They provide finer detail than the regular polarizabilities since they require space and time-varying fields. Using an effective action in the weak field limit, we have identified methods to isolate each of the physical quantities ($μ, α, β, γ_{E1}, γ_{M1}, γ_{E2}, γ_{M2}$) for spin-1/2 hadrons, both neutral and charged. We also perform a lattice QCD simulation to investigate the feasibility of the effective action approach.",

At present such fits have rather high values of chi^2/d.o.f., possibly due to the lack of ensembles with lighter-than-physical sea strange-quark masses. We propose solutions to this problem for future work.

The use of staple-shaped Wilson lines allows us to link lattice simulations to TMD effects determined from experiment, and in particular to access non-universal, naively time-reversal odd TMD observables. We present and discuss results for the generalized Sivers and Boer-Mulders transverse momentum shifts for the SIDIS and DY cases. The effect of staple-shaped Wilson lines on T-even observables is studied for the generalized tensor charge and a generalized transverse shift related to the worm gear function g_1T. We emphasize the dependence of these observables on the staple extent and the Collins-Soper evolution parameter. Our numerical calculations use an n_f = 2+1 mixed action scheme with domain wall valence fermions on an Asqtad sea and pion masses 369 MeV as well as 518 MeV.",

We explicitly present the expansion coefficients which have been determined numerically from data of a previous high statistics simulation of the O(4) model on a three-dimensional lattice of linear extension L=120.

For comparison we are now studying QCD with 3 flavours of colour-sextet quarks, which is believed to be conformal in the chiral limit. Here we present the results of simulations of lattice QCD with 3 colour-sextet quarks at finite temperatures on lattices of temporal extent $N_t=4$ and 6, with masses small enough to yield access to the chiral limit. As for the 2-flavour case, we find well-separated deconfinement and chiral-symmetry restoration transitions, both of which move to appreciably weaker couplings as $N_t$ is increased from 4 to 6. If this theory is conformal, we would expect there to be a bulk chiral transition at a fixed coupling. For this reason we conclude that for $N_t=4$ and 6, the chiral and hence the deconfinement transitions are in the strong-coupling domain where the theory is essentially quenched. The similarity between the behaviours of the 2 and 3 flavour theories suggested that the $N_t=4$ and 6 transitions for the 2-flavour theory also lie in the strong-coupling domain. The phase structure of both theories is very similar.",

To illustrate this point we introduce a new coordinate-space definition of the flavor fields that suppresses the O(a) term by two additional powers of a. In fact there are no errors at all from this mechanism. The only source of taste mixing comes from the exchange of highly-virtual gluons and enters in O(a^2). We review the idiosyncrasies of Symanzik improvement for naive/staggerd-quark actions, and show how these results follow from that program.",

      "summary": "Wilson chiral perturbation theory (WChPT) is the effective field theory describing the long- distance properties of lattice QCD with Wilson or twisted-mass fermions. We consider here WChPT for the theory with two light flavors of Wilson fermions or a single light twisted-mass fermion. Discretization errors introduce three low energy constants (LECs) into partially quenched WChPT at O(a^2), conventionally called W'_6, W'_7 and W'_8 . The phase structure of the theory at non-zero a depends on the sign of the combination 2W'_6 + W'_8, while the spectrum of the lattice Hermitian Wilson-Dirac operator depends on all three constants. It has been argued, based on the positivity of partition functions of fixed topological charge, and on the convergence of graded group integrals that arise in the epsilon-regime of ChPT, that there is a constraint on the LECs arising from the underlying lattice theory. In particular, for W'_6 = W'_7 = 0, the constraint found is W'_8 \\le 0. Here we provide an alternative line of argument, based on mass inequalities for the underlying partially quenched theory. We find that W'_8 \\le 0, irrespective of the values of W'_6 and W'_7. Our constraint implies that 2W'_6 > |W'_8| if the phase diagram is to be described by the first-order scenario, as recent simulations suggest is the case for some choices of action.",

We simulate lattice QCD with 2 light color-sextet staggered quarks at finite temperature, and use the dependence of the coupling at the chiral transition on the temporal extent, $N_t$, of the lattice in lattice units to study the running of the bare lattice coupling with lattice spacing. Our goal is to determine whether this theory is QCD-like and `walks', or if it is conformal. If it is QCD-like, the coupling at the chiral transition should tend to zero as $N_t \\rightarrow \\infty$ in a manner controlled by asymptotic freedom, i.e. by the perturbative $β$-function. On the other hand, if this theory is conformal, this coupling will approach a non-zero limit in the $N_t \\rightarrow \\infty$ limit. We are extending our simulations on an $N_t=8$ lattice to determine the position of the chiral transition with greater accuracy, and are performing simulations on an $N_t=12$ lattice.",

For small fermion masses we find two transitions at finite temperature that converge to two well-separated bulk phase transitions. The phase between the two transitions appears to be a novel phase. We identify order parameters showing that the single-site shift symmetry of staggered fermions is spontaneously broken in this phase. We investigate the eigenvalue spectrum of the Dirac operator, the static potential and the meson spectrum, which collectively establish that this novel phase is confining but chirally symmetric. The phase is bordered by first-order phase transitions, and since we find the same phase structure with Nf=8 fermions, we argue that the novel phase is most likely a strong-coupling lattice artifact, the existence of which does not imply IR conformality.",

      "summary": "We study the single site SU(N) lattice gauge theory with N_f=2 adjoint Wilson fermions for values of N up to 53. We determine the phase diagram of the theory as a function of the hopping parameter kappa and the inverse 't Hooft coupling b, searching for the region in which the Z_N^4 center symmetry is unbroken. In this region the theory is equivalent to the infinite volume theory when N goes to infinity. We find a region of values of kappa on both sides of kappa_c for which the symmetry is unbroken, including both light physical quarks and masses ~O(1/a). This is surrounded by a region with a complicated sequence of partially broken phases. We calculate Wilson loop expectation values and find that using N <= 53 it is possible to extract the heavy-quark potential at small distances (1-3 links) but not at longer distances. For this, larger values of N, or lattices with more sites, are needed.",

      "summary": "We present preliminary results of the calculation of the positive-parity ground state charm baryon spectrum using of N_f=2+1+1$ dynamical quarks. The calculation uses a relativistic heavy-quark action for the valence charm quark, clover-Wilson fermions for the valence light quarks and HISQ sea quarks. The spectrum is calculated with a lightest pion mass around 220 MeV and two lattice spacings ($a\\sim0.12$ fm and 0.09 fm) are used to extrapolate to continuum limit. Our preliminary results are consistent with the currently measured baryon spectrum, except for the isospin-averaged $J=1/2$ $Ξ_{cc}$ which is approximately $2 σ$ above the SELEX observed value. We predict the yet-to-be-discovered double and triple-charm baryons $Ξ_{cc}^*$, $Ω_{cc}$, $Ω_{cc}^*$, $Ω_{ccc}$ to have masses 3665(42)(29) MeV, 3694(40)(45) MeV, 3739(35)(21) MeV and 4782(24)(28) MeV, respectively.",

The need for multi-hadron operators in addition to single-hadron operators is emphasized, necessitating the use of a new stochastic method of treating the low-lying modes of quark propagation which exploits Laplacian Heaviside quark-field smearing. A new glueball operator is tested and computing the mixing of this glueball operator with a quark-antiquark operator and multiple two-pion operators is shown to be feasible. Some of our initial results show warning signs about extracting high-lying resonance energies using only single-hadron operators.",

      "summary": "It is argued by the author that the canonical form of the quark energy-momentum tensor with a partial derivative instead of the covariant derivative is the correct definition for the quark momentum and angular momentum fraction of the nucleon in covariant quantization. Although it is not manifestly gauge invariant, its matrix elements in the nucleon will be non-vanishing and are gauge invariant. We test this idea in the path-integral quantization by calculating correlation functions on the lattice with a gauge-invariant nucleon interpolation field and replacing the gauge link in the quark lattice momentum operator with unity, which corresponds to the partial derivative in the continuum. We find that the ratios of three-point to two-point functions are zero within errors for both the u and d quarks, contrary to the case without setting the gauge links to unity.",

We use the Fermilab interpretation of the clover action for heavy valence quarks and the asqtad action for light valence quarks. The central goal of the program is to provide ever more exacting tests of the unitarity of the CKM matrix. We give a progress report on one part of the program, namely the analysis of the semileptonic decay B to D at both zero and nonzero recoil. Although final results are not presented, we discuss improvements in the analysis methods, the statistical errors, and the parameter coverage that we expect will lead to a significant reduction in the final error for |V_cb| from this decay channel.",

We work with MILC N_f=2+1 lattices and use the Highly Improved Staggered Action (HISQ) for both the charm and the light valence quarks. We use both scalar and vector currents to determine the form factors f_0(q^2) and f_+(q^2) for a range of D and D_s form factors including those for D to pi and D to K semileptonic decays. By using a phased boundary condition we are able to tune accurately to q^2=0. We also compare the shape in q^2 to that from experiment. We show that the form factors are very insensitive to the spectator quark: D to K and D_s to eta_s form factors are essentially the same, and the same is true for D to pi and D_s to K. This has important implications when considering the corresponding B/B_s processes.",

      "summary": "GPU has a significantly higher performance in single-precision computing than that of double precision. Hence, it is important to take a maximal advantage of the single precision in the CG inverter, using the mixed precision method. We have implemented mixed precision algorithm to our multi GPU conjugate gradient solver. The single precision calculation use half of the memory that is used by the double precision calculation, which allows twice faster data transfer in memory I/O. In addition, the speed of floating point calculations is 8 times faster in single precision than in double precision. The overall performance of our CUDA code for CG is 145 giga flops per GPU (GTX480), which does not include the infiniband network communication. If we include the infiniband communication, the overall performance is 36 giga flops per GPU (GTX480).",

      "summary": "We report a possible solution to the trouble that the covariance fitting fails when the data is highly correlated and the covariance matrix has small eigenvalues. As an example, we choose the data analysis of highly correlated $B_K$ data on the basis of the SU(2) staggered chiral perturbation theory. Basically, the essence of the problem is that we do not have an accurate fitting function so that we cannot fit the highly correlated and precise data. When some eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are small, even a tiny error of fitting function can produce large chi-square and spoil the fitting procedure. We have applied a number of prescriptions available in the market such as diagonal approximation and cutoff method. In addition, we present a new method, the eigenmode shift method which fine-tunes the fitting function while keeping the covariance matrix untouched.",

      "summary": "The last few years have seen a dramatic improvement in our knowledge of the strange form factors of the nucleon. With regard to the vector from factors the level of agreement between theory and experiment gives us considerable confidence in our ability to calculate with non-perturbative QCD. The calculation of the strange scalar form factor has moved significantly in the last two years, with the application of new techniques which yield values considerably smaller than believed for the past 20 years. These new values turn out to have important consequences for the detection of neutralinos, a favourite dark matter candidate. Finally, very recent lattice studies have resurrected interest in the famed H-dibaryon, with modern chiral extrapolation of lattice data suggesting that it may be only slightly unbound. We review some of the major sources of uncertainty in that chiral extrapolation.",

We also include for the first time the effect of up, down, strange and charm quarks in the sea using 'second generation' gluon field configurations from the MILC collaboration. Using the Υ 2S - 1S splitting to determine the lattice spacing, we are able to obtain the 1P - 1S splitting to 1.4% and the 3S - 1S splitting to 2.4%. Our improved result for M (Upsilon) - M (eta_b) is 70(9) MeV and we predict M(Upsilon) - M(eta_b') = 35(3) MeV. We also calculate pi, K and eta_s correlators using the Highly Improved Staggered Quark action and perform a chiral and continuum extrapolation to give values for M(eta_s) (0.6893(12) GeV) and f_{eta_s} (0.1819(5) GeV) that allow us to tune the strange quark mass as well as providing an independent and consistent determination of the lattice spacing. Combining the NRQCD and HISQ analyses gives mb/ms = 54.7(2.5) and a value for the heavy quark potential parameter of r_1 = 0.3209(26) fm.",

      "summary": "We are doubtlessly familiar with some edition of Jackson's tome on electrodynamics, and Schwinger's calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron in QED. From the perspective of strong interactions, however, electromagnetic effects usually amount to negligible contributions. Despite this fact, electromagnetic probes have always been a fundamental source for our knowledge of QCD experimentally. Elastic scattering of electrons off nucleons provides us a window to their distributions of charge and magnetism. To account for the spectrum of QCD at the percent level, moreover, we need isospin breaking introduced from both quark masses and electric charges. This overview concerns some of the prospects and progress of studying electromagnetic effects in QCD. Our focus is divided between classical and quantum effects. In classical electromagnetic fields, the dynamical response of QCD to external conditions can be investigated. The vacuum and hadrons alike should be viewed as media which respond to external fields: both magnetize and polarize in magnetic fields, for example. At the quantum level, electromagnetism and QCD renormalize each other. In the era of high precision lattice computations, both strong and electromagnetic contributions must be accounted for to make predictions at the percent level.",

      "summary": "Scalar and tensor interactions were once competitors to the now well-established V-A structure of the Standard Model weak interactions. We revisit these interactions and survey constraints from low-energy probes (neutron, nuclear, and pion decays) as well as collider searches. Currently, the most stringent limit on scalar and tensor interactions arise from 0+ -> 0+ nuclear decays and the radiative pion decay pi -> e nu gamma, respectively. For the future, we find that upcoming neutron beta decay and LHC measurements will compete in setting the most stringent bounds. For neutron beta decay, we demonstrate the importance of lattice computations of the neutron-to-proton matrix elements to setting limits on these interactions, and provide the first lattice estimate of the scalar charge and a new average of existing results for the tensor charge. Data taken at the LHC is currently probing these interactions at the 10^-2 level (relative to the standard weak interactions), with the potential to reach the 10^-3 level. We show that, with some theoretical assumptions, the discovery of a charged spin-0 resonance decaying to an electron and missing energy implies a lower limit on the strength of scalar interactions probed at low energy.",

Earlier attempt with unimproved Wilson fermions at β=5.6 to verify the suppression of topological susceptibility with decreasing quark mass (m_q) was unable to unambiguously confirm the suppression. We carry out systematic calculations for two degenerate flavours at two different lattice spacings (β= 5.6 and 5.8). The effects of quark mass, lattice volume and the lattice spacing on the spanning of different topological sectors are presented. We unambiguously demonstrate the suppression of the topological susceptibility with decreasing quark mass, expected from chiral Ward identity and chiral perturbation theory.",

Bare quark masses have been retuned in accord with HPQCD's new r_1 scale. We find significant reductions in discretization effects compared to previous calculations with AsqTad light valence quarks.

These sheets may be interpreted as Luscher's \"Wilson bags,\" which are domain walls between discrete quasivacua labelled by a local value of the $θ$ parameter equal to $2πk$, with $k$ given by the number of units of background Ramond-Ramond flux. This picture of the vacuum is closely analogous to Coleman's description of the 2D massive Schwinger model, where $θ$ is interpreted as a background electric field, and a pointlike charged particle is a domain wall between vacua which differ by one unit of background electric flux. The main effect of the Ramond-Ramond U(1) field in low energy QCD dynamics is the generation of phenomenologically important contact terms: (1) The dominant contact term in the topological charge correlator which leads to positive topological susceptibility, (2) The $η'$ mass insertion, and (3) An $SU(N_f)\\times SU(N_f)$ invariant Nambu-Jona Lasinio 4-quark interaction.",

As the masses vary to unphysical values, regions of both first- and second-order phase transitions are expected.

This complicates matching lattice results with perturbative schemes and clarifies the tautology with attacking the strong CP problem via a vanishing up quark mass.",

Here we decompose the field strength of equilibrium gauge configurations into self-dual and anti-self-dual parts, and apply absolute X-distribution method to the resulting polarization dynamics in order to construct such characteristics. Using lattice regularization and focusing on pure-glue SU(3) gauge theory at zero temperature, we find evidence for positive but very small dynamical tendency for self-duality of vacuum in the continuum limit.",

Since Lattice 2010, we have reduced the statistical errors on the $a\\approx 0.09\\;$fm lattices by a factor of $\\sim 3$, and roughly doubled the size of the $a\\approx0.045\\;$fm ensemble.\n  We find that these improvements have a very significant impact on the continuum extrapolation, with the $a\\approx 0.12\\;$fm data lying outside the range of applicability of simple functional forms. Hence we use only the three smallest lattice spacings to perform the extrapolation, finding $\\hat{B}_K = B_K(\\text{RGI}) = 0.725 \\pm 0.004(\\text{stat}) \\pm 0.038(\\text{sys}) $.

Assuming this running is negligible we find a vanishing anomalous dimension, gamma=-0.03(13), however without this assumption our uncertainty in the running of the coupling leads to a much larger range of allowed values, -0.6 < gamma < 0.6.

      "summary": "We investigate the parity-broken phase (Aoki phase) for staggered-Wilson fermions by using the Gross-Neveu model and the strong-coupling lattice QCD. In the both cases the gap equations indicate the parity-broken phase exists and the pion becomes massless on the phase boundaries. We also show we can take the chiral and continuum limit in the Gross-Neveu model by tuning mass and gauge-coupling parameters. This supports the idea that the staggered-Wilson fermions can be applied to the lattice QCD simulation by taking a chiral limit, as with Wilson fermions.",

      "summary": "The study of QCD at finite baryon density is severely hampered by the so-called fermion sign problem. As a result, we have no known first principles approach to study nuclear matter, or neutron stars from QCD. On the surface, the large Nc limit does not seem to simplify matters. In this limit, however, one can exploit dualities that exist between strongly coupled gauge theories. Our focus will be on some rather novel orbifold equivalences that have recently been discovered at finite density. These equivalences relate strongly coupled theories plagued by a sign problem, to strongly coupled theories free of sign problems. As a result, such dualities give deeper insight into the nature of the sign problem and possibly provide a way to simulate QCD at finite density in the large Nc limit.",

      "summary": "Results of a high-statistics, multi-volume Lattice QCD exploration of the deuteron, the di-neutron, the H-dibaryon, and the Xi-Xi- system at a pion mass of m ~ 390 MeV are presented. Calculations were performed with an anisotropic n_f = 2+1 Clover discretization in four lattice volumes of spatial extent L ~ 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 and 4.0 fm, with a lattice spacing of b_s ~ 0.123 fm in the spatial-direction, and b_t ~ b_s/3.5 in the time-direction. The Xi-Xi- is found to be bound by B_{Xi-Xi-} = 14.0(1.4)(6.7) MeV, consistent with expectations based upon phenomenological models and low-energy effective field theories constrained by nucleon-nucleon and hyperon-nucleon scattering data at the physical light-quark masses. We find weak evidence that both the deuteron and the di-neutron are bound at this pion mass, with binding energies of B_d = 11(05)(12) MeV and B_{nn} = 7.1(5.2)(7.3) MeV, respectively. With an increased number of measurements and a refined analysis, the binding energy of the H-dibaryon is B_H = 13.2(1.8)(4.0) MeV at this pion mass, updating our previous result.",

Knowing the Standard Model inputs to nucleon matrix elements will be necessary to constrain the couplings of dark matter candidates such as the neutralino, to relate the neutron electric dipole moment to the CP-violating theta parameter, or to search for new TeV-scale particles though non-$V-A$ interactions in neutron beta decay. However, these matrix elements derive from the properties of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at low energies, where perturbative treatments fail. Using lattice gauge theory, we can nonperturbatively calculate the QCD path integral on a supercomputer. In this proceeding, I will discuss a few representative areas in which lattice QCD (LQCD) can contribute to the search for BSM physics, emphasizing suppressed operators in neutron decay, and outline prospects for future development.",

These couplings determine the leading interactions in heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory and are central quantities in heavy quark physics, as they control strong decay widths and the light-quark mass dependence of heavy hadron observables. Our analysis makes use of lattice data at six different pion masses, 227 MeV < m_π< 352 MeV, two lattice spacings, a=0.085, 0.112 fm, and a volume of (2.7 fm)^3. Our results for the axial couplings are g_1=0.449(51), g_2=0.84(20), and g_3=0.71(13), where g_1 governs the interaction between heavy-light mesons and pions and g_{2,3} are similar couplings between heavy-light baryons and pions. Using our lattice result for g_3, and constraining 1/m_Q corrections in the strong decay widths with experimental data for Σ_c^{(*)} decays, we obtain Γ[Σ_b^{(*)} \\to Λ_b π^\\pm] = 4.2(1.0), 4.8(1.1), 7.3(1.6), 7.8(1.8) MeV for the Σ_b^+, Σ_b^-, Σ_b^{*+}, Σ_b^{*-} initial states, respectively.

Using methods developed recently for HPQCD's study of $D \\rightarrow K, l ν$ decays, we find $f^{D \\rightarrow π}_+(0) = 0.666(29)$. This signifies a better than factor of two improvement in errors for this quantity compared to previous calculations. Combining the new result with CLEO-c branching fraction data, we extract the CKM matrix element $|V_{cd}| = 0.225(6)_{exp.}(10)_{lat.}$, where the first error comes from experiment and the second from theory. With a total error of $\\sim5.3$\\% the accuracy of direct determination of $|V_{cd}|$ from $D$ semileptonic decays has become comparable to (and in good agreement with) that from neutrino scattering. We also check for second row unitarity using this new $|V_{cd}|$, HPQCD's earlier $|V_{cs}|$ and $|V_{cb}|$ from the Fermilab Lattice \\& MILC collaborations.

From several different observables I extract a common exponent for the scaling of the correlation length xi with the fermion mass m_q, xi proportional to m_q to the power -1/y_m, with y_m ~ 1.35.

      "summary": "We present calculations of axial-current matrix elements between various heavy-meson and heavy-baryon states to the next-to-leading order in heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory in the p-regime. When compared with data from lattice computations or experiments, these results can be used to determine the axial couplings in the chiral Lagrangian. Our calculation is performed in partially-quenched chiral perturbation theory for both SU(4|2) and SU(6|3). We incorporate finite-size effects arising from a single Goldstone meson wrapping around the spatial volume. Results for full QCD with two and three flavours can be obtained straightforwardly by taking the sea-quark masses to be equal to the valence-quark masses. To illustrate the impact of our chiral perturbation theory calculation on lattice computations, we analyse the SU(2) full QCD results in detail. We also study one-loop contributions relevant to the heavy hadron strong-decay amplitudes involving final-state Goldstone bosons, and demonstrate that the quark-mass dependence of these amplitudes can be significantly different from that of the axial current matrix elements containing only single hadron external states.",

      "summary": "Volume modifications to the binding of two-body systems in large cubic volumes of extent L depend upon the total momentum and exponentially upon the ratio of L to the size of the boosted system. Recent work by Bour et al determined the momentum dependence of the leading volume modifications to nonrelativistic systems with periodic boundary conditions imposed on the single-particle wavefunctions, enabling them to numerically determine the scattering of such bound states using a low-energy effective field theory and Luscher's finite-volume method. The calculation of bound nuclear systems directly from QCD using Lattice QCD has begun, and it is important to reduce the systematic uncertainty introduced into such calculations by the finite spatial extent of the gauge-field configurations. We extend the work of Bour et al from nonrelativistic quantum mechanics to quantum field theory by generalizing the work of Luscher and of Gottlieb and Rummukainen to boosted two-body bound states. The volume modifications to binding energies can be exponentially reduced from ~ e^{-kappa L}/L to ~ e^{-2 kappa L}/L in nonrelativistic systems (where kappa is the binding momentum of the state) by forming particular combinations of the binding energies determined in the four lowest-lying boosted systems. Relativistic corrections to this combination, and others, that violate the exponential reduction are determined. An analysis of what can be expected from Lattice QCD calculations of the deuteron is performed, the results of which are representative of a generic loosely bound system.",

Using the two-lattice matching technique we measure the running of the coupling and the anomalous mass dimension. We find slow running of the coupling, compatible with an infrared fixed point. Assuming this running is negligible we find a vanishing anomalous dimension, gamma=-0.03(13), however taking this source of systematic error into account gives a much larger range of allowed values, -0.6 < gamma < 0.6. We also attempt to measure the anomalous mass dimension using the stability matrix method. We discuss the systematic errors affecting the current analysis and possible improvements.",

      "summary": "Chiral perturbation theory makes definitive predictions for the extrinsic behavior of hadrons in external electric and magnetic fields. Near the chiral limit, the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of pions, kaons, and nucleons are determined in terms of a few well-known parameters. In this limit, hadrons become quantum mechanically diffuse as polarizabilities scale with the inverse square-root of the quark mass. In some cases, however, such predictions from chiral perturbation theory have not compared well with experimental data. Ultimately we must turn to first principles numerical simulations of QCD to determine properties of hadrons, and confront the predictions of chiral perturbation theory. To address the electromagnetic polarizabilities, we utilize the background field technique. Restricting our attention to calculations in background electric fields, we demonstrate new techniques to determine electric polarizabilities and baryon magnetic moments for both charged and neutral states. As we can study the quark mass dependence of observables with lattice QCD, the lattice will provide a crucial test of our understanding of low-energy QCD, which will be timely in light of ongoing experiments, such as at COMPASS and HIγS.",

      "summary": "Discretization of supersymmetric Yang--Mills (SYM) theories is an old problem in lattice field theory. It has resisted solution until recently when new ideas drawn from orbifold constructions and topological field theories have been brought to bear on the question. The result has been the creation of a new class of lattice gauge theories in which the lattice action is invariant under one or more supersymmetries. The resultant theories are local, free of doublers and also possess exact gauge-invariance. In principle they form the basis for a truly non-perturbative definition of the continuum SYM theories. In the continuum limit they lead to a version of the Yang-Mills theory formulated in terms of {\\it twisted} fields. In this paper, we briefly review these ideas and then go on to describe the details of a C++ code, which can be used to simulate these theories. We sketch the design of the code, with particular emphasis being placed on SYM theories with $\\mathcal{N}=2$ in two dimensions and $\\mathcal{N}=4$ in three and four dimensions, making one-to-one comparisons between the essential components of the SYM theories and their corresponding counterparts appearing in the simulation",

Calculations were performed at two lattice spacings of b~0.125 fm and b~0.09 fm, at two strange quark masses, multiple light quark masses, and a number of lattice volumes. The ratios of light quark to strange quark masses are in the range 0.1 <= m_l / m_s <= 0.6, while pion masses are in the range 235 < m_π< 680 MeV. A two-flavor chiral perturbation theory analysis of the Lattice QCD calculations constrains the Gasser-Leutwyler coefficients bar{l}_3 and bar{l}_4 to be bar{l}_3 = 4.04(40)(+73-55) and bar{l}_4 = 4.30(51)(+84-60). All systematic effects in the calculations are explored, including those from the finite lattice space-time volume, the finite lattice spacing, and the finite fifth dimension in the domain-wall quark action. A consistency is demonstrated between a chiral perturbation theory analysis at fixed lattice spacing combined with a leading order continuum extrapolation, and the mixed-action chiral perturbation theory analysis which explicitly includes the leading order discretization effects. Chiral corrections to the pion decay constant are found to give f_π/ f = 1.062(26)(+42-40) where f is the decay constant in the chiral limit. The most recent scale setting by the MILC Collaboration yields a postdiction of f_π= 128.2(3.6)(+4.4-6.0)(+1.2-3.3) MeV at the physical pion mass.",

This calculation is performed at a fixed value of the lattice spacing, volume and pion mass that are typical of contemporary lattice computations. We focus on the nucleon axial charge, g_A, for which we use about 7,500 measurements, and on the average momentum of the unpolarized isovector parton distribution, <x>_{u-d}, for which we use about 23,000 measurements. All computations are done employing N_f=2+1+1 maximally-twisted-mass Wilson fermions and using non-perturbatively calculated renormalization factors. Excited state effects are shown to be negligible for g_A whereas they lead to an O(10%) downward shift for <x>_{u-d}.",

Calculations were performed at a pion mass of m_pi~390 MeV with an anisotropic n_f=2+1 clover fermion discretization in four lattice volumes, with spatial extent L~2.0, 2.5, 3.0 and 3.9 fm, and with a lattice spacing of b_s~0.123 fm in the spatial direction and b_t b_s/3.5 in the time direction. The phase-shift is determined from the energy-eigenvalues of pi+pi+ systems with both zero and non-zero total momentum in the lattice volume using Luscher's method. Our calculations are precise enough to allow for a determination of the threshold scattering parameters, the scattering length a, the effective range r, and the shape-parameter P, in this channel and to examine the prediction of two-flavor chiral perturbation theory: m_pi^2 a r = 3+O(m_pi^2/Lambda_chi^2). Chiral perturbation theory is used, with the Lattice QCD results as input, to predict the scattering phase-shift (and threshold parameters) at the physical pion mass. Our results are consistent with determinations from the Roy equations and with the existing experimental phase shift data.",

These operators follow from the subduction of operators of definite helicity into irreducible representations of the appropriate little groups. We show their effectiveness in explicit computations where we find that the spectrum of states interpolated by these operators is close to diagonal in helicity, admitting a description in terms of single-meson states of identified J^{PC}. The variationally determined optimal superpositions of the operators for each state give rapid relaxation in Euclidean time to that state, ideal for the construction of meson-meson operators and for the evaluation of matrix elements at finite momentum.",

The electromagnetic 2-point function is evaluated on the RBC-UKQCD lattice gauge configurations and this is fitted to a continuous form motivated by models of vector dominance. We determine a robust and reliable technique for performing this fit, allowing us to extract the most accurate results possible from our ensembles. This combined with data at very light quark masses produces the result a_μ^{(2)had}=641(33)(32) x 10^{-10} at the physical point, where the first uncertainty is statistical, and the second is an estimate of systematics, which is in agreement with previous results. We outline various methods by which this calculation can and will be improved in order to compete with the accuracy of alternative techniques of deducing this quantity from experimental scattering data.",

Through the comparison of the current set of measurements of higher order cumulants of net baryon number fluctuations with lattice QCD calculations and results from hadron resonance gas model we can learn to what extent freeze-out as, determined by such cumulants, occurs close to the QCD transition temperature and thus can probe critical behavior at small values of the baryon chemical potential. Understanding how the relation between freeze-out conditions and the QCD crossover transition is reflected in properties of the experimentally determined cumulants is an important prerequisite to search for the QCD critical point. We point out that even if perfect continuum extrapolated lattice QCD results would be available, it would be inappropriate to use these observables to extract the value of the QCD transition temperature at vanishing baryon chemical potential from experimental data. We furthermore provide indications that a recently performed comparison of lattice QCD results on cumulants with data from heavy ion experiments suffer from systematic as well as statistical uncertainties in the lattice QCD calculations. This makes such comparison of lattice QCD calculations with experimental data at present not useful.",

When we take into account lattice spacing and quark mass dependence of the hadron masses, the Taylor coefficients at low temperature are equal to those of hadron resonance gas. Thus the equation of state is smoothly connected to the hadron resonance gas equation of state at low temperatures. We also show how the elliptic flow is affected by this equation of state at the maximum SPS energy.",

      "title": "Large-N reduction in QCD with two adjoint Dirac fermions",
      "summary": "We use lattice simulations to study the single-site version of SU(N) lattice gauge theory with two flavors of Wilson-Dirac fermions in the adjoint representation, a theory whose large volume correspondent is expected to be conformal or nearly conformal. Working with N as large as 53, we map out the phase diagram in the plane of bare `t Hooft coupling, g^2 N, and of the lattice quark mass, a*m, and look for the region where the Z_N^4 center symmetry of the theory is intact. In this region one expects the large-N equivalence of the single site and infinite volume theories to be valid. As for the N_f=1 case (see Phys. Rev. D80: 065031), we find that the center-symmetric region is large and includes both light fermion masses and masses at the cutoff scale. We study the N-dependence of the width of this region and find strong evidence that it remains of finite width as N goes to infinity. Simulating with couplings as small as g^2 N = 0.005, we find that the width shrinks slowly with decreasing g^2 N, at a rate consistent with analytic arguments. Within the center-symmetric region our results for the phase structure, when extrapolated to infinite N, apply also for the large volume theory, which is minimal walking technicolor with N=infinity. We find a first-order transition as a function of a*m for all values of b, which we argue favors that the theory is confining in the infrared. Finally, we measure the eigenvalue densities of the Wilson-Dirac operator and its hermitian version, and use large Wilson loops to study the utility of reduction for extracting physical observables.",

We identify a lightest supermultiplet of hybrid mesons with JPC = (0,1,2)-+, 1-- built from a gluonic excitation of chromomagnetic character coupled to qqbar in an S-wave. The next lightest hybrids are suggested to be quark orbital excitations with the same gluonic excitation, while the next distinct gluonic excitation is significantly heavier. Existing models of gluonic excitations are compared to these findings and possible phenomenological consequences explored.",

The physically interesting region of this strongly coupled system can be influenced by an ultraviolet fixed point due to lattice artifacts.

I also introduce a new analysis method for the 2-lattice matching Monte Carlo renormalization group technique that significantly reduces finite volume effects. The combination of these two improvements allows me to measure the bare step scaling function in a region of the gauge coupling where it is clearly negative, indicating a positive renormalization group $β$ function and infrared conformality.",

Our interest is to find ways to effectively use GPUs for lattice calculations using the overlap operator. The large memory footprint of these codes requires the use of multiple GPUs in parallel.

We derive a set of conditions on the eigenvectors of modes with small eigenvalues (near-zero modes), such that staggered fermions reproduce the 't Hooft vertex in the continuum limit. We also show that, assuming these conditions, the correlators of flavor-singlet mesons are free of contributions singular in $1/m$, where $m$ is the quark mass. This conclusion holds also when a single flavor of sea quark is represented by the fourth root of the staggered-fermion determinant. We then test numerically, using the HISQ action, whether these conditions hold on realistic lattice gauge fields. We find that the needed structure does indeed emerge.",

      "summary": "The complex patterns of the hadronic spectrum have puzzled physicists since the early discovery of the \"particle zoo\" in the 1960s. Today, the properties of these myriad particles are understood to be the result of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) with some modification by the electroweak interactions. Despite the discovery of this fundamental theory, the description of the hadronic spectrum has long been dominated by phenomenological models, due to the difficulties of addressing QCD in the strong-coupling regime, where nonperturbative effects are essential. By making numerical calculations in discretized spacetime, lattice gauge theory enables the ab initio study of many low-energy properties of QCD. Significant efforts are underway internationally to use lattice QCD to directly compute properties of ground and excited-state baryons. Detailed knowledge of the hadronic spectrum will provide insight into the character of these states beyond what can be extracted from models.\n  In this review, I will focus on the latest progress in lattice calculations of the $P_{11}(1440)$, the poorly known hyperon spectrum and the energies of highly-excited states of the nucleon, Delta and other light-flavor baryons. In the heavy-flavor sector, I will concentrate on recent lattice-QCD calculations of baryon masses, particularly those that make predictions concerning yet-to-be-discovered baryons, such as $Ω_{cc}$, $Ξ^\\prime_b$ or triply-heavy baryons.",

This non-trivial zero would be an infrared stable fixed point, in which case the theory with massless quarks would be a conformal field theory. However, if the interaction between quarks and antiquarks becomes strong enough that a chiral condensate forms before this IR fixed point is reached, the theory is QCD-like with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry and confinement. However, the presence of the nearby IR fixed point means that there is a range of couplings for which the running coupling evolves very slowly, i.e. it 'walks'. We are simulating the lattice version of this theory with staggered quarks at finite temperature studying the changes in couplings at the deconfinement and chiral-symmetry restoring transitions as the temporal extent ($N_t$) of the lattice, measured in lattice units, is increased. Our earlier results on lattices with $N_t=4,6$ show both transitions move to weaker couplings as $N_t$ increases consistent with walking behaviour. In this paper we extend these calculations to $N_t=8$. Although both transition again move to weaker couplings the change in the coupling at the chiral transition from $N_t=6$ to $N_t=8$ is appreciably smaller than that from $N_t=4$ to $N_t=6$. This indicates that at $N_t=4,6$ we are seeing strong coupling effects and that we will need results from $N_t > 8$ to determine if the chiral-transition coupling approaches zero as $N_t \\rightarrow \\infty$, as needed for the theory to walk.",

      "summary": "We present the first evidence from lattice simulations that the magnetic monopoles in three dimensional compact quantum electrodynamics (cQED3) with N_f=2 and N_f= 4 four-component fermion flavors are in a plasma phase. The evidence is based mainly on the divergence of the monopole susceptibility (polarizability) with the lattice size at weak gauge couplings. A weak four-Fermi term added to the cQED3 action enabled simulations with massless fermions. The exact chiral symmetry of the interaction terms forbids symmetry breaking lattice discretization counterterms to appear in the theory's effective action. It is also shown that the scenario of a monopole plasma does not depend on the strength of the four-Fermi coupling. Other observables such as the densities of \"isolated\" dipoles and monopoles and the so-called specific heat show that a crossover from a dense monopole plasma to a dilute monopole gas occurs at strong couplings. The implications of our results on the stability of U(1) spin liquids in two spatial dimensions are also discussed.",

NVIDIA established CUDA as a parallel computing architecture controlling and making use of the compute power of GPUs. CUDA provides sufficient support for C++ language elements to enable the Expression Template (ET) technique in the device memory domain. QDP++ is a C++ vector class library suited for quantum field theory which provides vector data types and expressions and forms the basis of the lattice QCD software suite Chroma. In this work accelerating QDP++ expression evaluation to a GPU was successfully implemented leveraging the ET technique and using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. The Portable Expression Template Engine (PETE) and the C API for CUDA kernel arguments were used to build the bridge between host and device memory domains. This provides the possibility to accelerate Chroma routines to a GPU which are typically not subject to special optimisation. As an application example a smearing routine was accelerated to execute on a GPU. A significant speed-up compared to normal CPU execution could be measured.",

We show that it is the physical fermion contribution which is largely influenced by the r averaging. We have studied the possible interplay between finite size and cutoff effects by investigating in detail naive, O(a) improved and OStm Wilson fermion cases for a range of volumes and lattice fermion mass (am). For naive Wilson fermions r averaging is shown to remove the effects of the interplay. We have shown that for the pseudoscalar density term to O (g^2) the lattice result differs from the continuum result by exhibiting considerable am dependence which appears to be a manifestation of cutoff effects with naive Wilson fermion. The pseudoscalar density term to O(g^2) is shown to be almost independent of am when r-averaging is performed.",

This is done in terms of expansions in the scaling variable z= t/h^{1/Delta}. The expansions around z=0 and the corresponding asymptotic ones for z --> +- infinity overlap such that no interpolation is needed. The expansion coefficients are determined numerically from the data of a previous high statistics simulation of the O(4) model on a three-dimensional lattice of linear extension L=120. From the scaling function of the magnetization we calculate the leading asymptotic coefficients of the scaling function of the free energy density. As a result we obtain the universal amplitude ratio A^+/A^-=1.84(4) for the specific heat. Comparing the scaling function of the energy density to the data we find the non-singular part of the energy density epsilon_{ns}(T) with high precision and at the same time excellent scaling properties.",

A method for operator construction is introduced that allows for the reliable identification of the continuum spins of baryon states, overcoming the reduced symmetry of the cubic lattice. Using this method, we are able to determine a spectrum of single-particle states for spins up to and including J = 7/2, of both parities, the first time this has been achieved in a lattice calculation. We find a spectrum of states identifiable as admixtures of SU(6) x O(3) representations and a counting of levels that is consistent with the non-relativistic $qqq$ constituent quark model. This dense spectrum is incompatible with quark-diquark model solutions to the \"missing resonance problem\" and shows no signs of parity doubling of states.",

Conventional lattice form-factor calculations can only reach about 2.5 GeV$^2$, but in this work the transfer momentum is pushed as large as 6 GeV$^2$. Here, we demonstrate the results on 2+1-flavor anisotropic clover lattices for the nucleon and pion, comparing with low-$Q^2$ quantities, such as Dirac and Pauli radii, anomalous magnetic moments, $g_A$ and $M_A$. Our approach can be applied to isotropic lattices and lattices with smaller lattice spacing to achieve even larger-$Q^2$ form factors. The form factors are processed to obtain transverse charge and magnetization densities across 2-dimensional impact-parameter space. These measurements could give important theoretical input to experiments, such as those of JLab's 12-GeV program, and provide insight into hadronic structure.",

      "summary": "The volume dependence of the octet baryon masses and relations among them are explored with Lattice QCD. Calculations are performed with n_f=2+1 clover fermion discretization in four lattice volumes, with spatial extent L ~ 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 and 3.9 fm, with an anisotropic lattice spacing of b_s ~ 0.123 fm in the spatial direction, and b_t = b_s/3.5 in the time direction, and at a pion mass of m_pi ~ 390 MeV. The typical precision of the ground-state baryon mass determination is ~0.2%, enabling a precise exploration of the volume dependence of the masses, the Gell-Mann--Okubo mass relation, and of other mass combinations. A comparison of the volume dependence with the predictions of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory is performed in both the SU(2)_L X SU(2)_R and SU(3)_L X SU(3)_R expansions. Predictions of the three-flavor expansion for the hadron masses are found to describe the observed volume dependences reasonably well. Further, the Delta-N-pi axial coupling constant is extracted from the volume dependence of the nucleon mass in the two-flavor expansion, with only small modifications in the three-flavor expansion from the inclusion of kaons and etas. At a given value of m_pi L, the finite-volume contributions to the nucleon mass are predicted to be significantly smaller at m_pi ~ 140 MeV than at m_pi ~ 390 MeV due to a coefficient that scales as ~ m_pi^3. This is relevant for the design of future ensembles of lattice gauge-field configurations. Finally, the volume dependence of the pion and kaon masses are analyzed with two-flavor and three-flavor chiral perturbation theory.",

      "summary": "We report new results for a frequently discussed gauge theory with twelve fermion flavors in the fundamental representation of the SU(3) color gauge group. The model, controversial with respect to its conformality, is important in non-perturbative studies searching for a viable composite Higgs mechanism Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). To resolve the controversy, we subject the model to opposite hypotheses inside and outside of the conformal window. In the first hypothesis we test chiral symmetry breaking ($χ{\\rm SB}$) with its Goldstone spectrum, $F_π$, the $χ{\\rm SB}$ condensate, and several composite hadron states as the fermion mass is varied in a limited range with our best effort to control finite volume effects and extrapolation to the massless chiral limit. Supporting results for $χ{\\rm SB}$ from the running coupling based on the force between static sources and some preliminary evidence for the finite temperature transition are also presented. In the second test for the alternate hypothesis we probe conformal behavior driven by a single anomalous mass dimension under the assumption of unbroken chiral symmetry. Our results show a very low level of confidence in the conformal scenario. Staggered lattice fermions with stout-suppressed taste breaking are used throughout the simulations.",

      "title": "Chiral quark dynamics and topological charge: The role of the Ramond-Ramond U(1) Gauge Field in Holographic QCD",
      "summary": "The Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto construction of holographic QCD in terms of D4 color branes and D8 flavor branes in type IIA string theory is used to investigate the role of topological charge in the chiral dynamics of quarks in QCD. The QCD theta term arises from a compactified 5-dimensional Chern-Simons term on the D4 branes. This term couples the QCD topological charge to the Ramond-Ramond $U(1)$ gauge field of IIA string theory. The nonzero topological susceptibility of pure-glue QCD can be attributed to the presence of D6 branes, which constitute magnetic sources of the RR gauge field. The topological charge of QCD is required, by an anomaly inflow argument, to coincide in space-time with the intersection of the D6 branes and the D4 color branes. This clarifies the relation between D6 branes and the coherent, codimension-one topological charge membranes observed in QCD Monte Carlo calculations. Using open-string/closed-string duality, we interpret a quark loop (represented by a D4-D8 open string loop) in terms of closed-string exchange between color and flavor branes. The role of the RR gauge field in quark-antiquark annihilation processes is discussed. RR exchange in the s-channel generates a 4-quark contact term which produces an $η'$ mass insertion and provides an explanation for the observed spin-parity structure of the OZI rule. The $(\\log {\\rm Det\\;U})^2$ form of the $U(1)$ anomaly emerges naturally. RR exchange in the t-channel of the $q\\overline{q}$ scattering amplitude produces a Nambu-Jona Lasinio interaction which may provide a mechanism for spontaneous breaking of $SU(N_f)\\times SU(N_f)$.",

The volume dependence is examined using simulations on two lattices of spatial length $L=2.1$ fm and $L=2.8$ fm. The simulations span pion masses in the range of 260-470 MeV. Our results are renormalized non-perturbatively and the values are given in the $\\bar{\\rm MS}$ scheme at a scale $ μ=2$ GeV.

We show that the almost naive supercurrent is conserved at one loop. By contrast we find that this is not true for Wilson fermions and a canonical scalar action.

      "summary": "We discuss the relevance of higher order moments of net baryon number fluctuations for the analysis of freeze-out and critical conditions in heavy ion collisions at LHC and RHIC. Using properties of O(4) scaling functions, we discuss the generic structure of these higher moments at vanishing baryon chemical potential and apply chiral model calculations to explore their properties at non-zero baryon chemical potential. We show that the ratios of the sixth to second and eighth to second order moments of the net baryon number fluctuations change rapidly in the transition region of the QCD phase diagram. Already at vanishing baryon chemical potential they deviate considerably from the predictions of the hadron resonance gas model which reproduce the second to fourth order moments of the net proton number fluctuations at RHIC. We point out that the sixth order moments of baryon number and electric charge fluctuations remain negative at the chiral transition temperature. Thus, they offer the possibility to probe the proximity of the thermal freeze-out to the crossover line.",

We lock in the desired quark number sector using an exact Fourier transform of the fermion determinant. We scan the phase space below $T_c$ and look for an S-shape structure in the chemical potential, which signals the coexistence phase of a first order phase transition in finite volume. Applying Maxwell construction, we determine the boundaries of the coexistence phase at three temperatures and extrapolate them to locate the critical point. Using an improved gauge action and improved Wilson fermions on lattices with a spatial extent of $1.8 \\fm$ and quark masses close to that of the strange, we find the critical point at $T_E = 0.925(5) T_c$ and baryon chemical potential $μ_B^E = 2.60(8) T_c$.",

With only two significant lattice QCD calculations of the H-dibaryon binding energy at approximately the same lattice spacing, the forms of the chiral and continuum extrapolations to the physical point are not determined. In this brief report, we consider the constraints on the H-dibaryon imposed by two simple chiral extrapolations. In both instances, the extrapolation to the physical pion mass allows for a bound H-dibaryon or a near-threshold scattering state. Further lattice QCD calculations are required to clarify this situation.",

We compare such intersections with the distribution of zeromodes of the Dirac operator in the fundamental and adjoint representation using both the overlap and asqtad staggered fermion formulations in SU(2) lattice gauge theory. We analyze configurations with four intersections and find that the probability density distribution of fundamental zeromodes in the intersection plane differs significantly from the one obtained analytically in [Phys.\\ Rev.\\ D 66, 85004 (2002)]. The Dirac eigenmodes are clearly sensitive to the traces of the Polyakov (Wilson) lines and do not exactly locate topological charge contributions. Although, the adjoint Dirac operator is able to produce zeromodes for configurations with topological charge |Q|=1/2, they do not locate single vortex intersections, as we prove by forming arbitrary linear combinations of these zeromodes - their scalar density peaks at least at two intersection points. With pairs of thin and thick vortices we realize a situation similar to configurations with topological charge |Q|=1/2. For such configurations the zeromodes do not localize in the regions of fractional topological charge contribution but spread over the whole lattice, avoiding regions of negative traces of Polyakov lines.",

      "summary": "In the large N_c limit, some apparently different gauge theories turn out to be equivalent due to large N_c orbifold equivalence. We use effective field theory techniques to explore orbifold equivalence, focusing on the specific case of a recently discovered relation between an SO(2N_c) gauge theory and QCD. The equivalence to QCD has been argued to hold at finite baryon chemical potential, μ_B, so long as one deforms the SO(2N_c) theory by certain \"double-trace\" terms. The deformed SO(2N_c) theory can be studied without a sign problem in the chiral limit, in contrast to SU(N_c) QCD at finite μ_B. The purpose of the double-trace deformation in the SO(2N_c) theory is to prevent baryon number symmetry from breaking spontaneously at finite density, which is necessary for the equivalence to large N_c QCD to be valid. The effective field theory analysis presented here clarifies the physical significance of double-trace deformations, and strongly supports the proposed equivalence between the deformed SO(2N_c) theory and large N_c QCD at finite density.",

      "title": "Flavour blindness and patterns of flavour symmetry breaking in lattice simulations of up, down and strange quarks",
      "summary": "QCD lattice simulations with 2+1 flavours (when two quark flavours are mass degenerate) typically start at rather large up-down and strange quark masses and extrapolate first the strange quark mass and then the up-down quark mass to its respective physical value. Here we discuss an alternative method of tuning the quark masses, in which the singlet quark mass is kept fixed. Using group theory the possible quark mass polynomials for a Taylor expansion about the flavour symmetric line are found, first for the general 1+1+1 flavour case and then for the 2+1 flavour case. This ensures that the kaon always has mass less than the physical kaon mass. This method of tuning quark masses then enables highly constrained polynomial fits to be used in the extrapolation of hadron masses to their physical values. Numerical results for the 2+1 flavour case confirm the usefulness of this expansion and an extrapolation to the physical pion mass gives hadron mass values to within a few percent of their experimental values. Singlet quantities remain constant which allows the lattice spacing to be determined from hadron masses (without necessarily being at the physical point). Furthermore an extension of this programme to include partially quenched results is given.",

The use of a novel quark field construction has enabled us to overcome the long-standing challenge of efficiently including quark-annihilation contributions. Hidden-flavor mixing angles are extracted and while most states are found to be close to ideally flavor mixed, there are examples of large mixing in the pseudoscalar and axial sectors in line with experiment. The exotic JPC isoscalar states appear at a mass scale comparable to the exotic isovector states.",

We present results for three different sets of constraints: the standard inputs used by CKMfitter and UTFit, the standard inputs minus |Vub|, and the standard inputs minus both |Vub| and |Vcb|. For the required nonperturbative weak matrix elements, we use three-flavor lattice QCD averages from www.latticeaverages.org; these have been updated to reflect all available lattice calculations as of the \"End of 2010\". Given current theoretical and experimental inputs, we observe an approximately 3σ tension in the CKM unitarity triangle that can be interpreted as sign of physics beyond the standard model in the flavor sector. Using a model-independent parameterization of new physics effects, we test the compatibility of new physics in kaon mixing, in B-mixing, or in B \\rightarrow τ ν decay with the current data. Although the tension could be accommodated with each hypothesis, the scenarios with new physics in B-mixing or, to a lesser extent, in B \\rightarrow τ ν decay are strongly preferred. Finally, we interpret these results in terms contributions to ΔS = 2 and ΔB = 2 four-fermion operators. We find that the preferred scale of new physics (with Standard Model like couplings) is in the few hundred GeV range.",

We show that this feature combined with gauge invariance and the large point group symmetry of the lattice theory ensures that the only counterterms that appear at any order in perturbation theory correspond to renormalizations of existing terms in the bare lattice action. In particular we find that no mass terms are generated at any finite order of perturbation theory. We calculate these renormalizations by examining the fermion and auxiliary boson self energies at one loop and find that they all exhibit a common logarithmic divergence which can be absorbed by a single wavefunction renormalization. This finding implies that at one loop only a fine tuning of the finite parts is required to regain full supersymmetry in the continuum limit.",

Continuum limit extrapolations of vector meson and pseudo scalar correlators are performed and their large distance expansion in terms of thermal moments is introduced. We discuss consequences of this analysis for the calculation of the electrical conductivity of the QGP at this temperature.",

I propose two possible strategies to use optical lattices to mimic simulations performed in lattice gauge theory. I discuss how new developments in optical lattices could be used to generate local invariance and link composite operators with adjoint quantum numbers that could play a role similar to the link variables used in lattice gauge theory. This is a slightly expanded version of a poster presented at the KITP Conference: Frontiers of Ultracold Atoms and Molecules (Oct 11-15, 2010) that I plan to turn into a more comprehensive tutorial that could be used by members of the optical lattice and lattice gauge theory communities.

At the core of our analysis is a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector-vector contact interaction. In comparison with relevant quantities the root-mean-square-relative-error/degree-of freedom is 13%. Notable amongst our results is agreement between the computed baryon masses and the bare masses employed in modern dynamical coupled-channels models of pion-nucleon reactions. Our analysis provides insight into numerous aspects of baryon structure; e.g., relationships between the nucleon and Delta masses and those of the dressed-quark and diquark correlations they contain.",

We consider a generalized staggered Gross-Neveu model including two types of four-point interactions. We use generalized mass terms to split the doublers for both staggered and naive fermions. The phase boundaries derived from the gap equations show that the mass splitting of tastes results in an Aoki phase both in the staggered and naive cases. We also discuss the continuum limit of these models and explore taking the chirally-symmetric limit by fine-tuning a mass parameter and two coupling constants. This supports the idea that in lattice QCD we can derive one- or two-flavor staggered fermions by tuning the mass parameter, which are likely to be less expensive than Wilson fermions in QCD simulation.",

We focus on new results obtained on gauge configurations where the pseudo-scalar meson mass is in the range of 170-270 MeV. We will compare our results with various estimates obtained from chiral effective theories since we have some overlap with the quark mass region where results from such theories are believed to be applicable.",

      "summary": "We address a frequently asked question on the covariance fitting of the highly correlated data such as our $B_K$ data based on the SU(2) staggered chiral perturbation theory. Basically, the essence of the problem is that we do not have an accurate fitting function enough to fit extremely precise data. When eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are small, even a tiny error of fitting function yields large chi-square and spoils the fitting procedure. We have applied a number of prescriptions available in the market such as the cut-off method, modified covariance matrix method, and Bayesian method. We also propose a brand new method, the eigenmode shift method which allows a full covariance fitting without modifying the covariance matrix at all. In our case, the eigenmode shift (ES) method and Bayesian method turn out to be the best prescription to the problem. We also provide a pedagogical example of data analysis in which the diagonal approximation and the cut-off method fail in fitting manifestly, but the ES method and the Bayesian approach work well.",

We consider a regime where the quark mass $m$ and the lattice spacing $a$ obey the relative power counting $m\\sim a Λ_{\\rm QCD}^2$: in this situation discretisation effects can be treated as perturbation of the continuum behaviour. While this framework fails to describe lattice spectral density close to the threshold, it allows nevertheless to investigate important properties of the spectrum of the Wilson Dirac operator. We discuss the range of validity of our results and the possible implications in understanding the phase diagram of Wilson fermions.",

      "summary": "Motivated by recent attempts to find nontrivial infrared fixed points in 4-dimensional lattice gauge theories, we discuss the extension of the renormalization group (RG) transformations to complex coupling spaces for O(N) models on LxL lattices, in the large-N limit. We explain the Riemann sheet structure and singular points of the finite L mappings between the mass gap and the 't Hooft coupling. We argue that the Fisher's zeros appear on \"strings\" ending approximately near these singular points. We show that for the spherical model at finite N and L, the density of states is stripwise polynomial in the complex energy plane. We compare finite volume complex flows obtained from the rescaling of the ultraviolet cutoff in the gap equation and from the two-lattice matching. In both cases, the flows are channelled through the singular points and end at the strong coupling fixed points, however strong scheme dependence appear when the Compton wavelength of the mass gap is larger than the linear size of the system. We argue that the Fisher's zeros control the global properties of the complex flows. We briefly discuss the implications for perturbation theory, proofs of confinement and searches for nontrivial infrared fixed points in models beyond the standard model.",

The O(a) corrections to physical quantities are non-negligible and must be included to obtain high-precision simulation results for CKM physics.
