      "summary": "The slowly evolving gauge coupling of gauge-fermion systems near the conformal window makes numerical investigations of these models challenging. We consider finite size scaling and show that this often used technique leads to inconsistent results if the leading order scaling corrections are neglected. When the corrections are included the results become consistent not only between different operators but even when data obtained at different gauge couplings or with different lattice actions are combined. Our results indicate that the SU(3) 12-fermion system is conformal with mass anomalous dimension $γ_m=0.235(15)$.",

      "summary": "We study the single site lattice gauge theory of SU(N) coupled to one Dirac flavor of fermion in the adjoint representation. We utilize Möbius fermions for this study, and accelerate the calculation with graphics processing units (GPUs). Our Monte Carlo simulations indicate that for sufficiently large inverse 't Hooft coupling b = 1/g^2 N, and for N \\leq 10 the distribution of traced Polyakov loops has \"fingers\" that extend from the origin. However, in the massless case the distribution of eigenvalues of the untraced Polyakov loop becomes uniform at large N, indicating preservation of center symmetry in the thermodynamic limit. By contrast, for a large mass and large b, the distribution is highly nonuniform in the same limit, indicating spontaneous center symmetry breaking. These conclusions are confirmed by comparing to the quenched case, as well as by examining another observable based on the average value of the modulus of the traced Polyakov loop. The result of this investigation is that with massless adjoint fermions center symmetry is stabilized and the Eguchi-Kawai reduction should be successful; this is in agreement with most other studies.",

      "summary": "We compare recent lattice QCD calculations of higher order cumulants of net-strangeness fluctuations with hadron resonance gas (HRG) model calculations. Up to the QCD transition temperature Tc=( 154 +/- 9) MeV we find good agreement between QCD and HRG model calculations of second and fourth order cumulants, even when subtle aspects of net-baryon number, strangeness and electric charge fluctuations are probed. In particular, the fourth order cumulants indicate that also in the strangeness sector of QCD the failure of HRG model calculations sets in quite abruptly in the vicinity of the QCD transition temperature and is apparent in most observables for T > 160 MeV.",

This setup is being used by the chiQCD collaboration in calculations of physical quantities such as strangeness in the nucleon and the strange and charm quark masses. The scale independent renormalization constant for the axial vector current is computed using the Ward Identity. The renormalization constants for scalar, pseudoscalar and vector current are calculated in the RI-MOM scheme. Results in the MS-bar scheme are also given. The step scaling function of quark masses in the RI-MOM scheme is computed as well. The analysis uses, in total, six different ensembles of three sea quarks each on two lattices with sizes 24^3x64 and 32^3x64 at spacings a=(1.73 GeV)^{-1} and (2.28 GeV)^{-1}, respectively.",

This ratio is of interest in the context of fermion mass generation within composite Higgs theories.

These include the quark contributions from both the connected and disconnected insertions. The quark disconnected insertion loops are computed with $Z_4$ noise, and the signal-to-noise is improved with unbiased subtractions. The glue operator is comprised of gauge-field tensors constructed from the overlap operator. The calculation is carried out on a $16^3 \\times 24$ quenched lattice at $β= 6.0$ for Wilson fermions with $κ=0.154, 0.155$, and $0.1555$ which correspond to pion masses at $650, 538$, and $478$~MeV, respectively. The chirally extrapolated $u$ and $d$ quark momentum/angular momentum fraction is found to be $0.64(5)/0.70(5)$, the strange momentum/angular momentum fraction is $0.024(6)/0.023(7)$, and that of the glue is $0.33(6)/0.28(8)$. The previous study of quark spin on the same lattice revealed that it carries a fraction of $0.25(12)$ of proton spin. The orbital angular momenta of the quarks are then obtained from subtracting the spin from their corresponding angular momentum components. We find that the quark orbital angular momentum constitutes $0.47(13)$ of the proton spin with almost all of it coming from the disconnected insertions.",

      "summary": "The low-energy structure of hadrons can be described systematically using effective field theory, and the parameters of the effective theory can be determined from lattice QCD computations. Recent work, however, points to inconsistencies between the background field method in lattice QCD and effective field theory matching conditions. We show that the background field problem necessitates inclusion of operators related by equations of motion. In the presence of time-dependent electromagnetic fields, for example, such operators modify Green's functions, thereby complicating the isolation of hadronic parameters which enter on-shell scattering amplitudes. The particularly simple case of a scalar hadron coupled to uniform electromagnetic fields is investigated in detail. At the level of the relativistic effective theory, operators related by equations of motion are demonstrated to be innocuous. The same result does not hold in the non-relativistic effective theory, and inconsistencies in matching are resolved by carefully treating operators related by equations of motion. As uniform external fields potentially allow for surface terms, the problem is additionally analyzed on a torus where such terms are absent. Finite-size corrections are derived for charged scalar correlation functions in uniform electric fields as a useful byproduct.",

We discuss the finite-size scaling near the end point of the line of discontinuity of $\\barψ ψ$ in the beta-mass plane and in the larger beta-lower mass region. We discuss possible interpretations of these results in terms of Wilsonian RG flows and their possible relevance to construct composite Higgs models.",

We use gauge configurations generated by the MILC collaboration with $N_f=2+1+1$ flavors of sea quarks, which incorporate the effects of dynamical charm quarks as well as those of up, down, and strange. We employ data at three lattice spacings to extrapolate to the continuum limit. Our result, $f_+(0) = 0.9704(32)$, where the error is the total statistical plus systematic uncertainty added in quadrature, is the most precise determination to date. Combining our result with the latest experimental measurements of $K$ semileptonic decays, one obtains the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{us}|=0.22290(74)(52)$, where the first error is from $f_+(0)$ and the second one is from experiment. In the first-row test of Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa unitarity, the error stemming from $|V_{us}|$ is now comparable to that from $|V_{ud}|$.",

While more expensive than the staggered fermions used in past studies in this area, Wilson fermions can be used safely to simulate systems with three quark flavors. In this talk, we focus on the (pseudo)critical line that extends from $μ=0$ in the imaginary chemical potential plane, trace it to the Roberge-Weiss line, and determine its location relative to the Roberge-Weiss transition point. In order to smoothly follow the (pseudo)critical line in this plane we perform a multi-histogram reweighting in both temperature and chemical potential. To perform reweighting in the chemical potential we use the compression formula to compute the determinants exactly. Our results are compatible with the standard scenario.",

Static approximation is used for b quark and domain-wall fermion formalism is employed for light quarks. The calculations are done on 2+1 flavor dynamical ensembles, whose lattice spacings are 0.086 fm and 0.11 fm with a fixed physical spatial volume of about (2.7 fm)^3. In the static quark action, link-smearings are used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. We employ two kinds of link-smearings and their results are combined in taking a continuum limit. For the matching between the lattice and the continuum theory, one-loop perturbative calculations are used including O(a) improvements to reduce discretization errors.

This involves using Chiral Perturbation Theory with Electromagnetic corrections to find the renormalized, non-degenerate, light quark masses. The calculations are carried out on QCD ensembles generated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations using Domain Wall Fermions and the Iwasaki and Iwasaki+DSDR Gauge Actions with unitary pion masses down to 170 MeV. Non-compact QED is treated in the quenched approximation. The simulations use a $32^3$ lattice size with $a^{-1}=2.28(3)$ GeV (Iwasaki) and 1.37(1) (Iwasaki+DSDR). This builds on previous work from the RBC/UKQCD collaboration with lattice spacing $a^{-1}=1.78(4)$ GeV.",

      "summary": "We update our determinations of $f_{D^+}$, $f_{D_s}$, $f_K$, and quark mass ratios from simulations with four flavors of HISQ dynamical quarks. The availability of ensembles with light quarks near their physical mass means that we can extract physical results with only small corrections for valence- and sea-quark mass mistunings instead of a chiral extrapolation. The adjusted valence-quark masses and lattice spacings may be determined from an ensemble-by-ensemble analysis, and the results for the quark mass ratios then extrapolated to the continuum limit. Our central values of the charmed meson decay constants, however, come from an alternative analysis, which uses staggered chiral perturbation theory for the heavy-light mesons, and allows us to incorporate data at unphysical quark masses where statistical errors are often smaller. A jackknife analysis propagated through all of these steps takes account of the correlations among all the quantities used in the analysis. Systematic errors from the finite spatial size and EM effects are estimated by varying the parameters in the analysis, and systematic errors from the assumptions in the continuum extrapolation are estimated from the spread of values from different extrapolations.",

We analyze the quark mass and volume dependence of the chiral condensates and chiral susceptibilities in QCD with two degenerate light quarks and a strange quark. The strange quark mass is chosen to be fixed to its physical value ($m^{phy}_s$) and five values of light quark masses ($m_l$) that are varied in the interval 1/20$\\gtrsim m_l/m^{phy}_s \\gtrsim$1/80. Here various quark masses correspond to pseudo Goldstone pion masses ranging from about 160 MeV to about 80 MeV. The O(N) scaling of chiral observables and the influence of universal scaling on physical observables in the region of physical quark mass values are also discussed.",

Averaging the results of calculations performed with periodic and anti-periodic boundary conditions imposed upon the light-quark fields, or other pair-wise averages, improves the volume dependence of the deuteron binding energy from ~exp(-kappa*L)/L to ~exp(-sqrt(2)kappa*L)/L. However, a twist angle of pi/2 in each of the spatial directions improves the volume dependence from ~exp(-kappa*L)/L to ~exp(-2kappa*L)/L. Twist averaging the binding energy with a random sampling of twist angles improves the volume dependence from ~exp^(-kappa*L)/L to ~exp(-2kappa*L)/L, but with a standard deviation of ~exp(-kappa*L)/L, introducing a signal-to-noise issue in modest lattice volumes. Using the experimentally determined phase shifts and mixing angles, we determine the expected energies of the deuteron states over a range of cubic lattice volumes for a selection of twisted boundary conditions.",

In order to reduce the large statistical error coming from the vacuum-subtracted disconnected correlator, we employ a noise reduction method and a large number of configurations. We observe that the flavor-singlet scalar is lighter than the pion in this theory from the calculations with the fermion bilinear and gluonic operators. This peculiar feature is considered to be due to the infrared conformality of this theory, and it is a promissing signal for a walking technicolor, where a light composite Higgs boson is expected to emerge by approximate conformal dynamics.",

      "title": "On the Determination of Elastic and Inelastic Nuclear Observables from Lattice QCD",
      "summary": "One of the overarching goals of nuclear physics is to rigorously compute properties of hadronic systems directly from the fundamental theory of the strong interaction, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Currently, lattice QCD (LQCD) provides the only reliable option for performing calculations of low-energy hadronic observables. LQCD calculations are necessarily performed in a finite Euclidean spacetime. As a result, it is necessary to construct formalism that maps the finite-volume observables determined via LQCD to the infinite-volume quantities of interest. This methodology is commonly referred to as the Luscher method, as it was Martin Luscher who first developed such formalism for scalar bosons with zero total momentum below inelastic thresholds. In this work, we review recent progress on the generalization of this formalism. We present a detailed derivation of the extension of Luscher's seminal work for multi-channel two-body scalar systems, two-nucleon non-relativistic systems, and three-body non-relativistic scalar systems. For all of these scenarios we allow for the total momenta of the systems of interest to be nonzero. We also present steps towards being able to study weak processes involving two-nucleon systems, in particular we show how to determine the transition amplitude for proton-proton fusion (pp->e^+ + nu_e) directly from LQCD.",

      "summary": "We continue our simulations of QCD with 2 flavours of colour-sextet quarks as a model for walking technicolor. QCD with 3 flavours of colour-sextet quarks is also studied for comparison with the 2-flavour theory. We simulate these theories at finite temperatures T, using lattices with a finite extent $N_t a=1/T$ in the (Euclidean) time direction. The lattice coupling at the chiral-symmetry-restoration transition is measured as a function of $N_t$. If this is indeed a finite-temperature transition, the evolution of this coupling with $N_t$ as $N_t \\rightarrow \\infty$ and hence the lattice spacing $a \\rightarrow 0$ should be described by asymptotic freedom. If so, the theory is QCD-like and walking. If, however, this coupling approaches a constant non-zero value in the large $N_t$ limit, the transition is a bulk transition and the continuum theory is conformal. For the 2-flavour theory, the coupling does show a significant decrease between $N_t=8$ and $N_t=12$, favouring the walking scenario. However, preliminary results are that the change is less than that predicted by asymptotic freedom. For the 3-flavour case, which is expected to be conformal, there is still a significant decrease in the coupling between $N_t=6$ and $N_t=8$, indicating that we are not yet at large enough $N_t$.",

We use the twisted mass lattice formulation, with Symanzik improved gluon action.\n  For a comprehensive presentation of our results, along with detailed explanations and a more complete list of references, we refer to our forthcoming publication [1].",

The action is rewritten and the needed gauge-link combinations are precalculated. In tests with a MILC coarse lattice, this procedure accelerates the inverter by a factor of four. The remaining floating-point operations are mostly simple matrix multiplications between gauge links and fermion vectors, which we accelerate by more than an order of magnitude by using CUDA.

We compute the running gauge coupling derived non-perturbatively from the Schrodinger functional of the theory, finding no evidence for an infrared fixed point up through gauge couplings of order 20. This implies that the theory either is governed in the infrared by a fixed point of considerable strength, unseen so far in non-supersymmetric gauge theories, or breaks its global chiral symmetries producing a large number of composite Nambu-Goldstone bosons relative to the number of underlying degrees of freedom. Thus either of these phases exhibits novel behavior.",

We present a generalization of Lüscher's relation between the finite-volume spectrum and S-matrix to three particles. Specifically, we consider a scalar field theory, which has a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that prevents even/odd coupling. The theory is assumed to have no two-particle bound states and to have two-particle phase shifts that are bounded by $π/2$ in the regime of elastic scattering. Considering center of mass energies between one and five particle masses, we evaluate a three-to-three finite-volume correlator to all orders in perturbation theory. Only terms which are exponentially suppressed in volume are neglected. From poles in the correlator we then determine the relation between finite-volume spectrum and scattering quantities. In this analysis one must carefully treat the unitary cusp at two-particle threshold. This point, which was neglected in the conference talks, is described in some detail here. We also describe an important check on our main result by reproducing the large volume expansion of the energy shift from the three-particle threshold. This is found to be consistent with previous work through four non-trivial orders.",

      "summary": "We show that the Tensor Renormalization Group (TRG) method can be applied to O(N) spin models, principal chiral models and pure gauge theories (Z2, U(1) and SU(2)) on (hyper) cubic lattices. We explain that contrarily to some common belief, it is very difficult to write compact formulas expressing the blockspinning of lattice models. We show that in contrast to other approaches, the TRG formulation allows us to write exact blocking formulas with numerically controllable truncations. The basic reason is that the TRG blocking separates neatly the degrees of freedom inside the block and which are integrated over, from those kept to communicate with the neighboring blocks. We argue that the TRG is a method that can handle large volumes, which is crucial to approach quasi-conformal systems. The method can also get rid of some sign problems. We discuss recent results regarding the critical properties of the 2D O(2) nonlinear sigma model with complex beta and chemical potential. As some of these results appeared in a recently published paper (PRD 88, 056005) and two recent preprints (arXiv:1309.4963 and arXiv:1309.6623), these proceedings rather emphasize the conceptual aspects of our ongoing effort.",

A large set of baryonic operators that respect the symmetries of the lattice and are obtained after subduction from their continuum analogues are utilized.

Using novel computational techniques correlation functions of these operators are generated and the variational method is exploited to extract excited states. The lattice spectra that we obtain have baryonic states with well-defined total spins up to 7/2 and the low lying states remarkably resemble the expectations of quantum numbers from SU(6)$\\otimes$O(3) symmetry.",

We analyze two Nf=2+1+1 ensembles having pion masses of 213 MeV and 373 MeV with lattice spacing a=0.064 fm and a=0.082 fm, respectively. First results using an Nf=2 ensemble of twisted mass fermions with a clover term at a physical pion mass and lattice spacing a=0.094 fm are also presented. The renormalization function for the local tensor form factors is evaluated non-perturbatively with a perturbative subtraction of O(a^2)-terms, while for the first moment of the transversity we use a perturbative estimate. Results are given in the MS-bar scheme at a scale of mu=2 GeV, and are compared with recent results obtained using different discretization schemes.",

A large set of baryonic operators that respect the symmetries of the lattice and are obtained after subduction from their continuum analogues are utilized. Using novel computational techniques correlation functions of these operators are generated and the variational method is exploited to extract excited states. The lattice spectra that we obtain have baryonic states with well-defined total spins up to 7/2 and the low lying states remarkably resemble the expectations of quantum numbers from SU(6) $\\otimes$ O(3) symmetry. Various energy splittings between the extracted states, including splittings due to hyperfine as well as spin-orbit coupling, are considered and those are also compared against similar energy splittings at other quark masses. Using those splittings for doubly-charmed baryons, and taking input of experimental $B_c$ meson mass, we predict the mass splittings of $B^*_c - B_c$ to be about 80 $\\pm$ 8 MeV and $m_{Ω_{ccb}} = 8050\\pm10$ MeV.",

We apply the overlap operator as a tool to probe the topological properties of gauge field configurations which have been generated within the Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) discretization scheme on lattices of size $32^3\\times 8$ with $m_l/m_s=1/20$, commonly used for the study of QCD thermodynamics. Although we have at present, only results for one value of the quark masses and thus cannot monitor the change of the eigenvalue distributions with the light quark mass, the distribution of the low-lying eigenvalues of the overlap operator suggests that the $U_A(1)$ is not restored effectively even at 1.5 times the pseudo critical temperature. The corresponding low-lying eigenmodes show localization properties.",

At weak coupling the autocorrelation time of the global topological charge becomes very long because the HMC algorithm has trouble moving between topological sectors. We report the results of simulations that test two ideas for reducing the autocorrelation time of topological charge. In weak coupling quenched simulations we find that the open boundary conditions suggested by Lüscher and Schaefer do not prevent the appearance of extremely long autocorrelation times for topological observables. We discuss the idea of a \"dislocation-enhancing determinant\" and show that it can produce an increase in topological tunneling.",

We use a short Wilson flow to approach the renormalized trajectory before beginning RG blocking steps. By optimizing the length of the Wilson flow, we are able to determine an $s_b$ corresponding to a unique discrete $β$ function, after a few blocking steps. We carry out this study using new ensembles of 12-flavor gauge configurations generated with exactly massless fermions, using volumes up to $32^4$. The results are consistent with the existence of an infrared fixed point (IRFP) for all investigated lattice volumes and number of blocking steps. We also compare different renormalization schemes, each of which indicates an IRFP at a slightly different value of the bare coupling, as expected for an IR-conformal theory.",

      "summary": "This White Paper briefly reviews the present status of the muon (g-2) Standard-Model prediction. This value results in a 3 - 4 standard-deviation difference with the experimental result from Brookhaven E821. The present experimental uncertainty is $\\pm 63 \\times 10^{-11}$ (0.54~ppm), and the Standard-Model uncertainty is $\\simeq \\pm 49 \\times 10^{-11}$. Fermilab experiment E989 has the goal to reduce the experimental error to $\\pm 16 \\times 10^{-11}$. Improvements in the Standard-Model value, which should be achieved between now and when the first results from Fermilab E989 could be available, should lead to a Standard-Model uncertainty of $\\sim \\,\\pm 35 \\times 10^{-11}$. These improvements would halve the uncertainty on the difference between experiment and theory, and should clarify whether the current difference points toward New Physics, or to a statistical fluctuation. At present, the (g-2) result is arguably the most compelling indicator of physics beyond the Standard Model and, at the very least, it represents a major constraint for speculative new theories such as supersymmetry, dark gauge bosons or extra dimensions.",

The lattice scale $w_0/a$, originally proposed by the BMW collaboration, is computed using Symanzik flow at four lattice spacings ranging from 0.15 to 0.06 fm. With a Taylor series ansatz, the results are simultaneously extrapolated to the continuum and interpolated to physical quark masses. We give a preliminary determination of the scale $w_0$ in physical units, along with associated systematic errors, and compare with results from other groups. We also present a first estimate of autocorrelation lengths as a function of flowtime for these ensembles.",

      "summary": "We exploit a method introduced recently to determine parton distribution amplitudes (PDAs) from minimal information in order to obtain light-quark pseudoscalar and vector meson PDAs from the limited number of moments produced by numerical simulations of lattice-regularised QCD. Within errors, the PDAs of pseudoscalar and vector mesons constituted from the same valence quarks are identical; they are concave functions, whose dilation expresses the strength of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking; and SU(3)-flavour symmetry is broken nonperturbatively at the level of 10%. Notably, the appearance of precision in the lattice moments is misleading. The moments also exhibit material dependence on lattice volume, especially for the pion. Improvements need therefore be made before an accurate, unified picture of the light-front structure of light-quark pseudoscalar and vector mesons is revealed.",

We use a stochastic algorithm to measure the mode number up to the cutoff scale on lattices as large as $48^4$. Focusing on SU(3) lattice gauge theory with $N_f = 12$ massless fundamental fermions, we examine systematic effects due to finite volumes and non-zero fermion masses. Our results suggest the existence of an infrared fixed point with $γ_m^{\\star} \\approx 0.25$. Our method provides a unique probe to study systems from the UV to the IR. It is universal and can be applied to any lattice model of interest, including both chirally-broken and IR-conformal systems.",

Along with the performance, NVIDIA has also introduced many new technologies such as direct parallelism, hyper-Q and GPU Direct with RDMA. Apart from other usual GPUs, NVIDIA also released another Kepler 'GeForce' GPU named GTX Titan. GeForce GTX Titan is not only good for gaming but also good for high performance computing with CUDA. Nevertheless, it is remarkably cheaper than Kepler Tesla GPUs. We investigate the performance of GTX Titan and find out how to optimize a CUDA code appropriately for it. Meanwhile, Intel has launched its new many integrated core (MIC) system, Xeon Phi. A Xeon Phi coprocessor could provide similar performance with NVIDIA Kepler GPUs theoretically but, in reality, it turns out that its performance is significantly inferior to GTX Titan.",

Recent work by the SWME collaboration shows a significant disagreement with our previous results for two of these quantities. Since the origin of this disagreement is unknown, it is important to reduce the various uncertainties. In this work, we are using N_f=2+1 DWF with Iwasaki gauge action at inverse lattice spacings of 2.31 and 1.75 GeV, with multiple unitary pions on each ensemble, the lightest being 290 and 330 MeV on the finer and coarser of the two ensembles respectively. This extends previous work by the addition of a second lattice spacing (a^{-1}\\approx 1.75 GeV). Renormalization is carried out non-perturbatively in the RI/MOM scheme and converted perturbatively to MSbar.",

      "summary": "We solve the sign problem in a particle-hole symmetric spin-polarized fermion model on bipartite lattices using the idea of fermion bags. The solution can be extended to a class of models at half filling but without particle-hole symmetry. Attractive Hubbard models with an odd number of fermion species can also be solved. The new solutions should allow us to study quantum phase transitions that have remained unexplored so far due to sign problems.",

      "summary": "We review lattice results related to pion, kaon, D- and B-meson physics with the aim of making them easily accessible to the particle physics community. More specifically, we report on the determination of the light-quark masses, the form factor f+(0), arising in semileptonic K -> pi transition at zero momentum transfer, as well as the decay constant ratio fK/fpi of decay constants and its consequences for the CKM matrix elements Vus and Vud. Furthermore, we describe the results obtained on the lattice for some of the low-energy constants of SU(2)LxSU(2)R and SU(3)LxSU(3)R Chiral Perturbation Theory and review the determination of the BK parameter of neutral kaon mixing. The inclusion of heavy-quark quantities significantly expands the FLAG scope with respect to the previous review. Therefore, for this review, we focus on D- and B-meson decay constants, form factors, and mixing parameters, since these are most relevant for the determination of CKM matrix elements and the global CKM unitarity-triangle fit. In addition we review the status of lattice determinations of the strong coupling constant alpha_s.",

Generalizing the two-flavor case, we present a representation of the partition function in the form of a multidimensional theta function and show that the model exhibits a rich phase structure at zero temperature. The different phases, characterized by certain values of the particle numbers, are separated by first-order phase transitions. We work out the phase structure in detail for three and four fermion flavors and conjecture, based on an exploratory investigation of the five, six, and eight flavor case, that the maximal number of coexisting phases at zero temperature grows exponentially with increasing f.",

All needed Wick contractions are efficiently evaluated using a stochastic method of treating the low-lying modes of quark propagation that exploits Laplacian Heaviside quark-field smearing.

We use HYP-smeared improved staggered fermions on the $N_f = 2+1$ MILC asqtad lattices. Operator matching is done perturbatively at one-loop order. Chiral extrapolations are done using \"golden combinations\" in which one-loop chiral logarithms are absent. For the combined sea-quark mass and continuum extrapolation, we use three lattice spacings: $a \\approx 0.045, 0.06$ and $0.09 \\text{fm}$. Our results have a total error of 5-6%, which is dominated by the systematic error from matching and continuum extrapolation. For two of the BSM $B$-parameters, we agree with results obtained using domain-wall and twisted-mass dynamical fermions, but we disagree by $(4-5)σ$ for the other two.",

We also present results from a larger set of calculations that include an ensemble with pion mass 149 MeV and box size 5.6 fm, which nearly eliminates the uncertainty associated with extrapolation to the physical pion mass. The results show agreement with experiment for the vector form factors, which occurs only when excited-state contributions are reduced. Finally, we show results from a subset of ensembles that have pion mass 254 MeV with varying temporal and spatial box sizes, which we use for a controlled study of finite-volume effects and a test of the \"$m_πL=4$\" rule of thumb.",

We focus on the kinematic region where the $K^*$ or $φ$ recoils softly; there the newly available form factors are most precise and the nonlocal matrix elements can be included via an operator product expansion. Our results for the differential branching fractions calculated in the Standard Model are higher than the experimental data. We consider the possibility that the deviations are caused by new physics, and perform a fit of the Wilson coefficients $C_9$ and $C_9^\\prime$ to the experimental data for multiple $B^0 \\to K^{*0} μ^+ μ^-$ and $B_s^0 \\to φμ^+ μ^-$ observables. In agreement with recent results from complementary studies, we obtain $C_9-C_9^{SM} = -1.0 \\pm 0.6$ and $C_9^\\prime = 1.2 \\pm 1.0$, whose deviations from zero would indicate the presence of non-standard fundamental interactions.",

      "summary": "We perform a detailed, fully-correlated study of the chiral behavior of the pion mass and decay constant, based on 2+1 flavor lattice QCD simulations. These calculations are implemented using tree-level, O(a)-improved Wilson fermions, at four values of the lattice spacing down to 0.054 fm and all the way down to below the physical value of the pion mass. They allow a sharp comparison with the predictions of SU(2) chiral perturbation theory (χPT) and a determination of some of its low energy constants. In particular, we systematically explore the range of applicability of NLO SU(2) χPT in two different expansions: the first in quark mass (x-expansion), and the second in pion mass (ξ-expansion). We find that these expansions begin showing signs of failure around M_π=300 MeV for the typical percent-level precision of our N_f=2+1 lattice results. We further determine the LO low energy constants (LECs), F=88.0 \\pm 1.3\\pm 0.3 and B^\\msbar(2 GeV)=2.58 \\pm 0.07 \\pm 0.02 GeV, and the related quark condensate, Σ^\\msbar(2 GeV)=(271\\pm 4\\pm 1 MeV)^3, as well as the NLO ones, l_3=2.5 \\pm 0.5 \\pm 0.4 and l_4=3.8 \\pm 0.4 \\pm 0.2, with fully controlled uncertainties. We also explore the NNLO expansions and the values of NNLO LECs. In addition, we show that the lattice results favor the presence of chiral logarithms. We further demonstrate how the absence of lattice results with pion masses below 200 MeV can lead to misleading results and conclusions. Our calculations allow a fully controlled, ab initio determination of the pion decay constant with a total 1% error, which is in excellent agreement with experiment.",

In the free fermion case, the pole mass of this kind of unphysical modes is given by $\\tilde{E}=\\ln(1-M_5)$, which acquires an imaginary part, $iπ$, when $M_5>1$ and results in an oscillatory behavior of the domain wall fermion propagator in time. The existence of the unphysical modes in the presence of gauge fields is investigated in the mean field approximation, and their physical consequences are discussed. In addition, we also give a semiquantitative criterion for tuning $M_5$ in the realistic numerical study.",

We have recently completed the first unquenched calculation of the form factors for the rare decay B -> K ll. Extrapolated over the full kinematic range of q^2 via model-independent z expansion, these form factor results allow us to calculate several Standard Model observables. We compare with experiment (Belle, BABAR, CDF, and LHCb) where possible and make predictions elsewhere. We discuss preliminary results for Bs -> K l nu which, when combined with anticipated experimental results, will provide an alternative exclusive determination of |Vub|. We are exploring the possibility of using ratios of form factors for this decay with those for the unphysical decay Bs -> eta_s as a means of significantly reducing form factor errors. We are also studying B -> pi l nu, form factors for which are combined with experiment in the standard exclusive determination of |Vub|.

      "summary": "The last five years have brought considerable progress in the study of the bound-state problem in continuum quantum field theory. We highlight a subset of that progress; viz., that made within the context of Dyson Schwinger equation analyses of cold, sparse hadrons. Our focus is primarily on advances in the reliable computation, explanation and prediction of quantities that are truly measurable; but we also review aspects of a new paradigm that has condensates contained within hadrons, and explain that the asymptotic form of parton distribution amplitudes and functions are practically unreachable with terrestrial facilities. Given the pace of expansion in experiment and improvement in theory, it appears possible that the next five years will bring profound growth in our store of knowledge about hadrons and nuclei.",

      "summary": "After some introductory comments on the peculiar features of slowly running theories, I will report results obtained using the Schrodinger functional technique for two gauge theories that are believed to lie near the bottom of the conformal window: the SU(3) theory with two adjoint Dirac fermions, and the SU(4) theory with six Dirac fermions in the two-index antisymmetric representation. In both cases we find a small beta function in strong coupling, but we cannot confirm or rule out an infrared fixed point. In both theories the mass anomalous dimension levels off, staying well below 0.5, much like the theories with fermions in the two-index symmetric representation investigated earlier.",

      "summary": "Finite size scaling is a powerful tool to study the critical properties of systems governed by one relevant operator, assuming all irrelevant operators have scaling dimensions much smaller then zero. This condition is likely not satisfied in many-fermion conformal systems where perturbation theory predicts a nearly-marginal irrelevant gauge coupling. In this work we carry out a new investigation of SU(3) lattice gauge theory with 12 fundamental flavors. Analyzing data at many different gauge couplings, our preliminary results indicate that a finite size scaling analysis that takes into account the effect of a nearly-marginal gauge coupling can resolve many of the inconsistencies observed previously in this system, leading to results consistent with conformal infrared dynamics and predicting a mass scaling anomalous around $γ_m=0.25$.",

When approaching the critical surface at zero quark mass, the hierarchy of masses in the different sectors of the spectrum gives a new handle to determine the existence of an infrared fixed point. We describe the details of our gluonic measurements and the results obtained on a large number of gauge configurations generated with the HISQ action. In particular, we focus on the scalar glueball and its mixing with a flavour-singlet fermionic state, which is lighter than the pseudoscalar (would-be pion) state. The results are interesting in view of a light composite Higgs boson in walking technicolor theories.",

It is shown that the extractions of the infinite-volume deuteron binding energy and the low-energy scattering parameters, including the S-D mixing angle, are possible from Lattice QCD calculations of two-nucleon systems with boosts of |P| <= 2pi sqrt{3}/L in volumes with spatial extents L satisfying fm <~ L <~ 14 fm.",

The standard model of strong and electroweak interactions, with its modest number of input parameters, dictates the dynamics of the quarks and gluons - the underlying building blocks of protons, neutrons, and nuclei. While the analytic techniques of quantum field theory have played a key role in understanding the dynamics of matter in high energy processes, they encounter difficulties when applied to low-energy nuclear structure and reactions, and dense systems. Expected increases in computational resources into the exa-scale during the next decade will provide the ability to numerically compute a range of important strong interaction processes directly from QCD with quantifiable uncertainties using the technique of Lattice QCD. These calculations will refine the chiral nuclear forces that are used as input into nuclear many-body calculations, including the three- and four-nucleon interactions. I discuss the state-of-the-art Lattice QCD calculations of quantities of interest in nuclear physics, progress that is expected in the near future, and the impact upon nuclear physics.",

      "title": "The QCD chiral transition, $\\ua$ symmetry and the Dirac spectrum using domain wall fermions",
      "summary": "We report on a study of the finite-temperature QCD transition region for temperatures between 139 and 196 MeV, with a pion mass of 200 MeV and two space-time volumes: $24^3\\times8$ and $32^3\\times8$, where the larger volume varies in linear size between 5.6 fm (at T=139 MeV) and 4.0 fm (at T=195 MeV). These results are compared with the results of an earlier calculation using the same action and quark masses but a smaller, $16^3\\times8$ volume. The chiral domain wall fermion formulation with a combined Iwasaki and dislocation suppressing determinant ratio gauge action are used. This lattice action accurately reproduces the $\\sua$ and $\\ua$ symmetries of the continuum. Results are reported for the chiral condensates, connected and disconnected susceptibilities and the Dirac eigenvalue spectrum. We find a pseudo-critical temperature, $T_c$, of approximately 165 MeV consistent with previous results and strong finite volume dependence below $T_c$. Clear evidence is seen for $\\ua$ symmetry breaking above $T_c$ which is quantitatively explained by the measured density of near-zero modes in accordance with the dilute instanton gas approximation.",

      "summary": "The energy spectra of two nucleons in a cubic volume provide access to the two phase shifts and one mixing angle that define the S-matrix in the 3S1-3D1 coupled channels containing the deuteron. With the aid of recently derived energy quantization conditions for such systems, and the known scattering parameters, these spectra are predicted for a range of volumes. It is found that extractions of the infinite-volume deuteron binding energy and leading scattering parameters, including the S-D mixing angle at the deuteron pole, are possible from Lattice QCD calculations of two-nucleon systems with boosts of |P| <= 2pi sqrt{3}/L in volumes with 10 fm <~ L <~ 14 fm. The viability of extracting the asymptotic D/S ratio of the deuteron wavefunction from Lattice QCD calculations is discussed.",

Calculations on several lattice volumes are performed with a range of light quark masses corresponding to pion masses down to about 400 MeV. The distillation method enables us to evaluate the required disconnected contributions with high statistical precision for a large number of meson interpolating fields. We find relatively little mixing between light and strange in most JPC channels; one notable exception is the pseudoscalar sector where the approximate SU(3)F octet, singlet structure of the η, η' is reproduced. We extract exotic JPC states, identified as hybrid mesons in which an excited gluonic field is coupled to a color-octet qqbar pair, along with non-exotic hybrid mesons embedded in a qqbar-like spectrum.",

In our study we use two improved staggered fermion formulations, namely the highly improved staggered quark formulation, and the so-called p4 formulation, as well as several lattice spacings. Second order quark number susceptibilities are calculated using both improved staggered fermion formulations, and we show that in the continuum limit the two formulations give consistent results. The fourth order quark number susceptibilities are studied only using the p4 formulation and at non-zero lattice spacings. We compare our results on quark number susceptibilities with recent weak coupling calculations, and find that these agree reasonably well with the lattice calculations within the estimated uncertainties.",

Based on simulations with the HISQ-type action on several lattice sizes with various fermion masses, we find evidence of a flavor-singlet scalar meson with mass comparable to that of the Nambu-Goldstone pion in both the small fermion-mass region, where chiral perturbation theory works, and the intermediate fermion-mass region where the hyperscaling relation holds. We further discuss its chiral limit extrapolation in comparison with other states studied in our previous paper: the scalar has a mass much smaller than that of the vector meson, which is compared to the Nambu-Goldstone pion having a vanishing mass in that limit.",

This simple framework produces results that are practically indistinguishable from the best otherwise available, an outcome which highlights that the key to describing many features of baryons and unifying them with the properties of mesons is a veracious expression of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the hadron bound-state problem. The following specific results are of particular interest. The Δelastic form factors are very sensitive to m_Δ. Hence, given that the parameters which define extant simulations of lattice-regularised QCD produce Δ-resonance masses that are very large, the form factors obtained therewith are a poor guide to properties of the Δ(1232). Considering the Δ-baryon's quadrupole moment, whilst all computations produce a negative value, the conflict between theoretical predictions entails that it is currently impossible to reach a sound conclusion on the nature of the Δ-baryon's deformation in the infinite momentum frame. Results for analogous properties of the Ωbaryon are less contentious. In connection with the N->Δtransition, the Ash-convention magnetic transition form factor falls faster than the neutron's magnetic form factor and nonzero values for the associated quadrupole ratios reveal the impact of quark orbital angular momentum within the nucleon and Δ; and, furthermore, these quadrupole ratios do slowly approach their anticipated asymptotic limits.",

The quenched valence fermions come in three flavors, two degenerate mass ones and a third heavier flavor.

We use chiral perturbation theory and meson models to address the effect of a Dirichlet boundary on chiral symmetry breaking. While pions are the longest-range modes in QCD, the restoration of chiral symmetry due to a boundary is shown not to depend upon the pion Compton wavelength but rather on that of the sigma meson. Power-law finite size corrections are exposed, and require prohibitively large lattices to overcome. We further speculate on the frustration of the chiral condensate for the case of confinement to the surface of a sphere.",

      "summary": "Recent lattice QCD calculations from the HAL and NPLQCD Collaborations have reported evidence for the existence of a bound state with strangeness -2 and baryon number 2 at quark masses somewhat higher than the physical values. A controlled chiral extrapolation of these lattice results to the physical point suggested that the state, identified with the famed H dibaryon, is most likely slightly unbound (by 13 $\\pm$ 14 MeV) with respect to the $Λ--Λ$ threshold. We report the results of an updated analysis which finds the H unbound by 26 $\\pm$ 11 MeV. Apart from the insight it would give us into how QCD is realized in Nature, the H is of great interest because of its potential implications for the equation of state of dense matter and studies of neutron stars. It may also explain the enhancement above the $Λ--Λ$ threshold already reported experimentally. It is clearly of great importance that the latter be pursued in experiments at the new J-PARC facility.",

We argue that similar results should hold for most models studied by lattice gauge theorists. We provide exact blocking formulas for several 2D spin models (the O(2) and O(3) sigma models and the SU(2) principal chiral model) and for the 3D gauge theories with groups Z_2, U(1) and SU(2). We briefly discuss generalizations to other groups, higher dimensions and practical implementations.",

Further, we discuss how the freeze-out parameters of heavy-ion collisions can be determined in a model-independent way through direct comparisons between experimentally measured higher order cumulants of conserved charges and corresponding Lattice QCD calculations. Utilizing the preliminary data from the STAR and PHENIX experiments we illustrate this method. Although, the Lattice QCD based determinations of the freeze-out parameters utilizing data sets of different experiments and different observables are currently not consistent with each other, it is tantalizing to see that all the observed freeze-out parameters lie very close to the chiral/deconfinement crossover region of QCD.",

Furthermore, there exist many points in the $(f-1)$-dimensional space of traceless chemical potentials where two or three phases can coexist for $f=3$ and two, three, four or six phases can coexist for $f=4$.

This integral is dominated by euclidean momenta of order the muon mass, i.e., momenta not accessible on current lattice volumes with periodic boundary conditions. Twisted boundary conditions can in principle help in accessing momenta of any size even in a finite volume, but their use leads to a modification of the Ward-Takahashi identity that normally guarantees transversality of the vacuum polarization. As a result, the vacuum polarization contains a non-transversal, quadratically divergent term, which arises as an artifact of using twisted boundary conditions in a finite volume. In this article, we show how to determine and remove this term from the vacuum polarization.",

      "summary": "We apply Schroedinger functional methods to two gauge theories with fermions in two-index representations: the SU(3) theory with Nf=2 adjoint fermions, and the SU(4) theory with Nf=6 fermions in the two-index antisymmetric representation. Each theory is believed to lie near the bottom of the conformal window for its respective representation. In the SU(3) theory we find a small beta function in strong coupling but we cannot confirm or rule out an infrared fixed point. In the SU(4) theory we find a hint of walking - a beta function that approaches the axis and then turns away from it. In both theories the mass anomalous dimension remains small even at the strongest couplings, much like the theories with fermions in the two-index symmetric representation investigated earlier.",

      "summary": "A novel method is employed to compute the pion electromagnetic form factor, F_π(Q^2), on the entire domain of spacelike momentum transfer using the Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) framework in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The DSE architecture unifies this prediction with that of the pion's valence-quark parton distribution amplitude (PDA). Using this PDA, the leading-order, leading-twist perturbative QCD result for Q^2 F_π(Q^2) underestimates the full computation by just 15% on Q^2>~8GeV^2, in stark contrast with the result obtained using the asymptotic PDA. The analysis shows that hard contributions to the pion form factor dominate for Q^2>~8GeV^2 but, even so, the magnitude of Q^2 F_π(Q^2) reflects the scale of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, a pivotal emergent phenomenon in the Standard Model.",

      "summary": "It has been argued that the leading scalar-isoscalar WIMP-nucleus interactions receive parametrically enhanced contributions in the context of nuclear effective field theories. These contributions arise from meson-exchange currents (MECs) and potentially modify the impulse approximation estimates of these interactions by 10--60%. We point out that these MECs also contribute to the quark mass dependence of nuclear binding energies, that is, nuclear σ-terms. In this work, we use recent lattice QCD calculations of the binding energies of the deuteron, He-3 and He-4 at pion masses near 500 MeV and 800 MeV, combined with the experimentally determined binding energies at the physical point, to provide approximate determinations of the σ-terms for these light nuclei. For each nucleus, we find that the deviation of the corresponding nuclear σ-term from the single-nucleon estimate is at the few percent level, in conflict with the conjectured enhancement. As a consequence, lattice QCD calculations currently indicate that the cross sections for scalar-isoscalar WIMP-nucleus interactions arising from fundamental WIMP interactions with quarks do not suffer from significant uncertainties due to enhanced meson-exchange currents.",

The calculations have been done using two ensembles of HISQ lattices generated by the MILC Collaboration with 2+1+1 dynamical flavors at a lattice spacing of 0.12 fm and with light-quark masses corresponding to pions with masses 310 and 220 MeV. We perform a systematic study including excited-state degrees of freedom and examine the dependence of the extracted nucleon matrix elements on source-sink separation. This study demonstrates with high-statistics data that including excited-state contributions and generating data at multiple separations is necessary to remove contamination that would otherwise lead to systematic error. We also determine the renormalization constants of the associated quark bilinear operators in the RI-sMOM scheme and make comparisons of our renormalized results with previous dynamical-lattice calculations.",

      "summary": "Recently it has been shown how a topologically twisted version of ${\\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills may be discretized in such a way as to preserve one scalar supersymmetry at nonzero lattice spacing. The remaining fifteen supersymmetries are broken by terms of ${\\cal O}(a)$ where $a$ is the lattice spacing. One would like to know whether these remaining supersymmetries are regained in the continuum limit $a \\to 0$ and, if not, how much tuning of the couplings in the lattice action is required. In this paper we derive the form of these additional twisted supersymmetries by combining a set of discrete R-symmetries of the continuum theory with the action of the scalar supersymmetry. We then argue that restoration of rotational symmetry in the continuum limit of the lattice theory likely implies restoration of R-symmetry and hence should lead to an automatic enhancement to the full ${\\cal N}=4$ supersymmetry without further fine-tuning.",

      "summary": "We apply non-perturbative renormalization to bilinears composed of improved staggered fermions. We explain how to generalize the method to staggered fermions in a way which is consistent with the lattice symmetries, and introduce a new type of lattice bilinear which transforms covariantly and avoids mixing. We derive the consequences of lattice symmetries for the propagator and vertices. We implement the method numerically for hypercubic-smeared (HYP) and asqtad valence fermion actions, using lattices with asqtad sea quarks generated by the MILC collaboration. We compare the non-perturbative results so obtained to those from perturbation theory, using both scale-independent ratios of bilinears (of which we calculate 26), and the scale-dependent bilinears themselves. Overall, we find that one-loop perturbation theory provides a successful description of the results for HYP-fermions if we allow for a truncation error of roughly the size of the square of the one-loop term (for ratios) or of size O(1) \\times α^2 (for the bilinears themselves). Perturbation theory is, however, less successful at describing the non-perturbative asqtad results.",

      "summary": "A method is explained through which a pointwise accurate approximation to the pion's valence-quark distribution amplitude (PDA) may be obtained from a limited number of moments. In connection with the single nontrivial moment accessible in contemporary simulations of lattice-regularised quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the method yields a PDA that is a broad concave function whose pointwise form agrees with that predicted by Dyson-Schwinger equation analyses of the pion. Under leading-order evolution, the PDA remains broad to energy scales in excess of 100 GeV, a feature which signals persistence of the influence of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. Consequently, the asymptotic distribution, φ_π^asy(x), is a poor approximation to the pion's PDA at all such scales that are either currently accessible or foreseeable in experiments on pion elastic and transition form factors. Thus, related expectations based on φ_π^asy(x) should be revised.",

The form factor results, based on the z expansion, are valid over the full kinematic range of q^2.

Before reaching this phase, all physical hadronic masses and scattering amplitudes are expected to behave smoothly with the up-quark mass, even as this mass passes through zero. In Euclidean space, the topological susceptibility of the gauge fields is positive at positive quark masses but diverges to negative infinity as the Dashen phase is approached. A zero in this susceptibility provides a tentative signal for the point where the mass of the up quark vanishes. I discuss potential ambiguities with this determination.",

In this initial study we work in the limit of static b quarks, where the number of independent form factors reduces to two. We use dynamical domain-wall fermions for the light quarks, and perform the calculation at two different lattice spacings and at multiple values of the light-quark masses in a single large volume. Using our form factor results, we calculate the $Λ_b \\to p μ^- \\barν$ differential decay rate in the range $14 GeV^2 \\leq q^2 \\leq q^2_{max}$, and obtain the integral $\\int_{14 GeV^2}^{q^2_{max}} [dΓ/dq^2] dq^2 / |V_{ub}|^2 = 15.3 \\pm 4.2 ps^{-1}$. Combined with future experimental data, this will give a novel determination of $|V_{ub}|$ with about 15\\% theoretical uncertainty. The uncertainty is dominated by the use of the static approximation for the b quark, and can be reduced further by performing the lattice calculation with a more sophisticated heavy-quark action.",

Combined with our previous study, that showed twelve-flavor QCD to be consistent with being in the conformal window, we infer that the lightness of the scalar state is due to infrared conformality.

The quantization condition presented gives access to the scattering parameters of the two-nucleon systems with arbitrary parity, spin, isospin, angular momentum and center of mass motion, from a lattice QCD calculation of the energy eigenvalues. In particular, as it includes all non-central interactions, such as the two-nucleon tensor force, it makes explicit the dependence of the mixing parameters of nucleon-nucleon systems calculated from lattice QCD when there is a physical mixing among different partial-waves, e. g. S-D mixing in the deuteron channel. We provide explicit relations among scattering parameters and their corresponding point group symmetry class eigenenergies with orbital angular momentum l smaller than or equal to 3, and for center of mass boost vectors of the form 2π(2n_1, 2n_2, 2n_3)/L, 2π(2n_1, 2n_2, 2n_3+1)/L and 2π(2n_1+1, 2n_2+1, 2n_3)/L. L denotes the special extent of the cubic volume and n_1,n_2,n_3 are integers. Our results are valid below inelastic thresholds up to exponential volume corrections that are governed by the pion mass.",

      "summary": "In this paper we present the perturbative computation of the renormalization functions for the quark field and for a complete set of ultra-local fermion bilinears. The computation of the relevant Green's functions was carried out at 1-loop level for the staggered action using massive fermions. The gluon links which appear both in the fermion action and in the definition of the bilinears have been improved by applying a stout smearing procedure up to 2 times, iteratively. In the gluon sector we employed the Symanzik improved gauge action for different sets of values of the Symanzik coefficients. The renormalization functions are presented in (two variants of) the RI' and in the MSbar renormalization scheme; the dependence on all stout parameters, as well as on the fermion mass, the gauge fixing parameter and the renormalization scale, is shown explicitly. This work is related to our recent paper [Phys. Rev. D86 (2012) 094512, arXiv:1209.6015].

For temperatures up to the chiral crossover separate contributions of strange mesons and baryons can be well described by an uncorrelated gas of hadrons. Such a description breaks down in the chiral crossover region, suggesting that the deconfinement of strangeness takes place at the chiral crossover. On the other hand, the strangeness carrying degrees of freedom inside the quark gluon plasma can be described by a weakly interacting gas of quarks only for temperatures larger than twice the chiral crossover temperature. In the intermediate temperature window these observables show considerably richer structures, indicative of the strongly interacting nature of the quark gluon plasma.",

Here we present arguments supporting this assumption. First, we show that, for partially quenched QCD with staggered quarks, a transfer matrix can be constructed. This transfer matrix is not Hermitian, but it is bounded, and it can be used to construct correlation functions in the usual way. Combining these observations with an extension of the Vafa--Witten theorem to the partially quenched theory allows us to argue that the partially quenched theory satisfies the cluster property. By extending Leutwyler's analysis of the unquenched case to the partially quenched theory, we then conclude that the existence and properties of the transfer matrix as well as clustering are sufficient for partially quenched chiral perturbation theory to be the correct low-energy theory for partially quenched QCD.",

The configurations are generated by the RBC collaboration on a 24^3*64 lattice with sea quark mass am_l=0.005, am_s=0.04, and inverse lattice spacing a^{-1}=1.73GeV. Both actions have chiral symmetry which is essential in avoiding contamination due to the operator mixing with other flavors. Nucleon propagator and the quark loops are both computed with stochastic grid sources, while low-mode substitution and low-mode averaging methods are used respectively which substantially improve the signal to noise ratio. We obtain the strangeness matrix element f_{T_{s}} = m_s <N|\\bar{s}s|N> / M_N = 0.0334(62), and the charmness content f_{T_{c}} = m_c <N|\\bar{c}c|N> / M_N = 0.094(31) which is resolved from zero by 3σprecision for the first time.",

      "summary": "The proton is arguably the most fundamental of Nature's readily detectable building blocks. It is at the heart of every nucleus and has never been observed to decay. It is nevertheless a composite object, defined by its valence-quark content: u+u+d -- i.e., two up (u) quarks and one down (d) quark; and the manner by which they influence, inter alia, the distribution of charge and magnetisation within this bound-state. Much of novelty has recently been learnt about these distributions; and it now appears possible that the proton's momentum-space charge distribution possesses a zero. Experiments in the coming decade should answer critical questions posed by this and related advances; and we explain how such new information may assist in charting the origin and impact of key emergent phenomena within the strong interaction. Specifically, we show that the possible existence and location of a zero in the proton's electric form factor are a measure of nonperturbative features of the quark-quark interaction in the Standard Model, with particular sensitivity to the running of the dressed-quark mass.",

In particular we analyze the creation of near-zero modes from would-be zero modes of various topological charge contributions from center vortices. We show that classical colorful spherical vortex and instanton ensembles have almost identical Dirac spectra and the low-lying eigenmodes from spherical vortices show all characteristic properties for chiral symmetry breaking. We further show that also vortex intersections are able to give rise to a finite density of near-zero modes, leading to chiral symmetry breaking via the Banks-Casher formula. We discuss the mechanism by which center vortex fluxes contribute to chiral symmetry breaking.",

      "summary": "Multi-hadron operators are crucial for reliably extracting the masses of excited states lying above multi-hadron thresholds in lattice QCD Monte Carlo calculations. The construction of multi-hadron operators with significant coupling to the lowest-lying multi-hadron states of interest involves combining single hadron operators of various momenta. The design and implementation of large sets of spatially-extended single-hadron operators of definite momentum and their combinations into two-hadron operators are described. The single hadron operators are all assemblages of gauge-covariantly-displaced, smeared quark fields. Group-theoretical projections onto the irreducible representations of the symmetry group of a cubic spatial lattice are used in all isospin channels. Tests of these operators on 24^3 x 128 and 32^3 x 256 anisotropic lattices using a stochastic method of treating the low-lying modes of quark propagation which exploits Laplacian Heaviside quark-field smearing are presented. The method provides reliable estimates of all needed correlations, even those that are particularly difficult to compute, such as eta eta -> eta eta in the scalar channel, which involves the subtraction of a large vacuum expectation value. A new glueball operator is introduced, and the evaluation of the mixing of this glueball operator with a quark-antiquark operator, pi-pi, and eta-eta operators is shown to be feasible.",

Our lattice theory uses a reduced staggered fermion formalism to generate two Dirac flavors in the continuum limit. In the current study we have tried to reduce lattice spacing and taste breaking effects by using an improved fermion action incorporating stout smeared links. As in our earlier study we observe two regimes; for weak gauge coupling the chiral condensate behaves as an order parameter differentiating a phase at small four fermi coupling where the condensate vanishes from a phase at strong four fermi coupling in which chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. This picture changes qualitatively when the gauge coupling is strong enough to cause confinement; in this case we observe a first order phase transition for some critical value of the four fermi coupling associated with a strong enhancement of the chiral condensate. We observe that this critical four fermi coupling varies monotonically with bare gauge coupling - decreasing, as expected, as the gauge coupling is increased. We have checked that these results remain stable under differing levels of smearing. They appear to rule out the appearance of new fixed points associated with chirally invariant four fermion interactions in confining non abelian gauge theories.",

The renormalization constants are evaluated non-perturbatively with a perturbative subtraction of ${\\cal O}(a^2)$-terms.

We explain how the BF method is implemented in automated perturbation theory and discuss the technique for matching the relativistic and non-relativistic theories. We compute the one-loop radiative corrections to the sigma.B and Darwin terms for the NRQCD action currently used in simulations, as well as the one-loop coefficients of the spin-dependent O(alpha^2) four-fermion contact terms. The effect of the corrections on the hyperfine splitting of bottomonium is estimated using earlier simulation results; the corrected lattice prediction is found to be in agreement with experiment. Agreement of the hyperfine splitting of bottomonium and the B-meson system is confirmed by recent simulation studies (Dowdall et al.) which include our NRQCD radiative corrections for the first time.",

Lattice computations of these matrix elements by the Fermilab Lattice/MILC collaborations (and earlier by the HPQCD collaboration) convert a light staggered quark into a naive quark, and construct the relevant 4-quark operators as local products of two local bilinears, each involving the naive light quark and the heavy quark. This particular representation of the operators turns out to be important in the chiral calculation, and it results in the presence of \"wrong-spin\" operators, whose contributions however vanish in the continuum limit. If the matrix elements of all five operators are computed on the lattice, then no additional low energy constants are required to describe wrong-spin chiral effects.",

      "summary": "We investigate chiral and conformal properties of the lattice QCD with eight flavors (Nf=8) through meson spectrum using the Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) action. We also compare our results with those of Nf=12 and Nf=4 which we study on the same systematics. We find that the decay constant F_pi of the pseudoscalar meson \"pion\" is non-zero, with its mass M_pi consistent with zero, both in the chiral limit extrapolation of the chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). We also measure other quantities which we find are in accord with the pi data results: The rho meson mass is consistent with non-zero in the chiral limit, and so is the chiral condensate, with its value neatly coinciding with that from the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation in the chiral limit. Thus our data for the Nf=8 QCD are consistent with the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry. Remarkably enough, while the Nf=8 data near the chiral limit are well described by the ChPT, those for the relatively large fermion bare mass m_f away from the chiral limit actually exhibit a finite-size hyperscaling relation, suggesting a large anomalous dimension gamma_m ~ 1. This implies that there exists a remnant of the infrared conformality, and suggests that a typical technicolor (\"one-family model\") as modeled by the Nf=8 QCD can be a walking technicolor theory having an approximate scale invariance with large anomalous dimension gamma_m ~ 1.",

      "summary": "The boundary of a manifold can alter the phase of a theory in the bulk. We explore the possibility of a boundary-induced phase transition for the chiral symmetry of QCD. In particular, we investigate the consequences of imposing homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on the quark fields. Such boundary conditions are sometimes employed in lattice gauge theory computations, for example, when including external electromagnetic fields, or when computing quark propagators with a reduced temporal extent. Homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions force the chiral condensate to vanish at the boundary, and thereby obstruct the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in the bulk. We show the restoration of chiral symmetry due to a boundary is a non-perturbative phenomenon depending upon the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and utilize the sigma model to exemplify the issues. Within this model, we find that chiral symmetry is completely restored if the length of the compact direction is less than 2.0 fm. For lengths greater than about 4 fm, an approximately uniform chiral condensate forms centered about the midpoint of the compact direction. While the volume-averaged condensate approaches the infinite volume value as the compact direction becomes very long, the finite-size corrections are shown to be power law rather than exponential.",

Exploring the spectrum of many-flavour QCD, and its scaling near the chiral limit, is mandatory in order to establish if one of these models realises the Walking Technicolor scenario. Although lattice technologies to study the mesonic spectrum are well developed, scalar flavour-singlet states still require extra effort to be determined. In addition, gluonic observables usually require large-statistic simulations and powerful noise-reduction techniques.

We show that, similarly to the symmetric case, we can build an algorithm that is capable of computing a few smallest magnitude eigenvalues and their corresponding left and right eigenvectors of a nonsymmetric matrix using only a small window of the BiCG residuals while simultaneously solving a linear system with that matrix. For a system with multiple right-hand sides, we give an algorithm that computes incrementally more eigenvalues while solving the first few systems and then uses the computed eigenvectors to deflate BiCGStab for the remaining systems. Our experiments on various test problems, including Lattice QCD, show the remarkable ability of EigBiCG to compute spectral approximations with accuracy comparable to that of the unrestarted, nonsymmetric Lanczos. Furthermore, our incremental EigBiCG followed by appropriately restarted and deflated BiCGStab provides a competitive method for systems with multiple right-hand sides.",

      "summary": "The standard approach for computing the trace of the inverse of a very large, sparse matrix $A$ is to view the trace as the mean value of matrix quadratures, and use the Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate it. This approach is heavily used in our motivating application of Lattice QCD. Often, the elements of $A^{-1}$ display certain decay properties away from the non zero structure of $A$, but random vectors cannot exploit this induced structure of $A^{-1}$. Probing is a technique that, given a sparsity pattern of $A$, discovers elements of $A$ through matrix-vector multiplications with specially designed vectors. In the case of $A^{-1}$, the pattern is obtained by distance-$k$ coloring of the graph of $A$. For sufficiently large $k$, the method produces accurate trace estimates but the cost of producing the colorings becomes prohibitively expensive. More importantly, it is difficult to search for an optimal $k$ value, since none of the work for prior choices of $k$ can be reused.",

Nonperturbative input comes from the calculation of the Upsilon and B_s energies in lattice QCD including the effect of u, d and s sea quarks. We use an improved NRQCD action for the b-quark. This is combined with the heavy quark energy shift in NRQCD determined using a mixed approach of high-beta simulation and automated lattice perturbation theory.

Lattice QCD can provide precise predictions for these systems, which can be compared to other theoretical approaches. In this work, the spectrum of excited states of the Omega_bbb baryon is calculated using lattice NRQCD for the b quarks, and using a domain-wall action for the u, d and s sea quarks. The calculations are done for multiple values of the sea-quark masses, and for two different lattice spacings. The energies of states with angular momentum up to J=7/2 are calculated, and the effects of rotational symmetry breaking by the lattice are analyzed. Precise results are obtained even for the small spin-dependent energy splittings, and the contributions of individual NRQCD interactions to these energy splittings are studied. The results are compared to potential-model calculations.",

      "summary": "We present some of the reasoning and results substantiating the notion that spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking (SChSB) in QCD is encoded in local chiral properties of Dirac eigenmodes. Such association is possible when viewing chirality as a dynamical effect, measured with respect to the benchmark of statistically independent left-right components. Following this rationale leads to describing local chiral behavior by a taylor-made correlation, namely the recently introduced correlation coefficient of polarization C_A. In this language, correlated modes (C_A>0) show dynamical preference for local chirality while anti-correlated modes (C_A<0) favor anti-chirality. Our conclusion is that SChSB in QCD can be viewed as dominance of low-energy correlation (chirality) over anti-correlation (anti-chirality) of Dirac sea. The spectral range of local chirality, chiral polarization scale Lambda_ch, is a dynamically generated scale in the theory associated with SChSB. One implication of these findings is briefly discussed.",

The theoretical error is dominated by hadronic light-by-light diagrams, and since direct measurements are extremely difficult, model calculations factorize it into two-photon diagrams connected by the lightest hadrons. We employ perturbative techniques to express the photon as a superposition of QCD eigenstates accessible in lattice-QCD calculations and found that vector-meson dominance is a poor description of the two-photon decay process when both photons are off shell.",

      "summary": "Both theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo observations indicate that the topological structure of the QCD vacuum consists of a laminated array of extended, coherent codimension-one membranes of alternating sign. Large-$N_c$ arguments, supported by gauge/string holography, indicate that these membranes are domain walls which separate discrete \"flux vacua\" with values of the topological $θ$ parameter which differ by $\\pm 2π$. This exposes a close analogy with 2D U(1) gauge theory, where $θ$ can be interpreted as electric polarization, and the domain walls are pointlike charged particles. In 4D QCD, the $θ$ parameter represents background Ramond-Ramond flux, which can be interpreted as a polarization of the charged membranes in the vacuum. In this framework, the chiral condensate is formed from the quark surface modes on the membranes. Massless Goldstone boson propagation takes place due to a coordination between bulk oscillations of the polarization field $θ$ and the surface currents represented by the Chern-Simons 3-form on the brane surface. This coordination is enforced by overall gauge invariance which imposes an anomaly inflow constraint between bulk and surface currents.",

We extrapolate the results to physical light-quark masses and to the continuum limit. At the current stage of the analysis, most, but not all, of the systematic errors have been estimated.

      "summary": "A calculation of the ratio of leptonic decay constants f_{K^+}/f_{π^+} makes possible a precise determination of the ratio of CKM matrix elements |V_{us}|/|V_{ud}| in the Standard Model, and places a stringent constraint on the scale of new physics that would lead to deviations from unitarity in the first row of the CKM matrix. We compute f_{K^+}/f_{π^+} numerically in unquenched lattice QCD using gauge-field ensembles recently generated that include four flavors of dynamical quarks: up, down, strange, and charm. We analyze data at four lattice spacings a ~ 0.06, 0.09, 0.12, and 0.15 fm with simulated pion masses down to the physical value 135 MeV. We obtain f_{K^+}/f_{π^+} = 1.1947(26)(37), where the errors are statistical and total systematic, respectively. This is our first physics result from our N_f = 2+1+1 ensembles, and the first calculation of f_{K^+}/f_{π^+} from lattice-QCD simulations at the physical point. Our result is the most precise lattice-QCD determination of f_{K^+}/f_{π^+}, with an error comparable to the current world average. When combined with experimental measurements of the leptonic branching fractions, it leads to a precise determination of |V_{us}|/|V_{ud}| = 0.2309(9)(4) where the errors are theoretical and experimental, respectively.",

      "summary": "The scattering lengths and effective ranges that describe low-energy nucleon-nucleon scattering are calculated in the limit of SU(3)-flavor symmetry at the physical strange-quark mass with Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics. The calculations are performed with an isotropic clover discretization of the quark action in three volumes with spatial extents of L \\sim 3.4 fm, 4.5fm and 6.7 fm, and with a lattice spacing of b \\sim 0.145 fm. With determinations of the energies of the two-nucleon systems (both of which contain bound states at these up and down quark masses) at rest and moving in the lattice volume, Luscher's method is used to determine the low-energy phase shifts in each channel, from which the scattering length and effective range are obtained. The scattering parameters, in the 1S0 channel are found to be m_pi a^(1S0) = 9.50^{+0.78}_{-0.69}^{+1.10}_{-0.80} and m_pi r^(1S0) = {4.61^{+0.29}_{-0.31}^{+0.24}_{-0.26}, and in the 3S1 channel are m_pi a^(3S1) = 7.45^{+0.57}_{-0.53}^{+0.71}_{-0.49} and m_pi r^(3S1) = 3.71^{+0.28}_{-0.31}^{+0.28}_{-0.35}. These values are consistent with the two-nucleon system exhibiting Wigner's supermultiplet symmetry, which becomes exact in the limit of large-N_c. In both spin channels, the phase shifts change sign at higher momentum, near the start of the t-channel cut, indicating that the nuclear interactions have a repulsive core even at the SU(3)-symmetric point.",

We provide an overview of lattice QCD methods to compute the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of hadrons. Central to these methods is the lattice simulation of quarks in uniform, classical electromagnetic fields. A long-term goal is the determination of polarizabilities directly from lattice computations, however, in the near term, one may need to rely on partially quenched chiral perturbation theory. Nonetheless the same striking predictions for the pion mass dependence of electric and magnetic polarizabilities can be made from chiral dynamics, and tested with lattice QCD. A particular focus is a novel new method to handle charged particle correlation functions in magnetic fields.",

The Nf=8 in particular is interesting from the model-building point of view: The typical walking technicolor model with the large anomalous dimension is the so-called one-family model (Farhi-Susskind model). Thus we explore the walking behavior in LQCD with 8 HISQ quarks by comparing with the 4-flavor case (in which the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken). We report preliminary results on the spectrum, analyzed through the chiral perturbation theory and the finite-size hyperscaling, and we discuss the availability of the Nf=8 QCD to the phenomenology.",

These were extracted using the Feynman-Hellman theorem from a chiral perturbation theory fit to octet baryon mass data from the PACS-CS collaboration. Of particular interest is the precise determination of the strangeness sigma term $σ_s = 21 \\pm 6$ MeV. In this work, we elaborate on the critical effect which the choice of scale setting has on this value. We discuss the prospect that the comparison of direct and 'spectrum' determinations of the sigma terms from the lattice can provide insight not only into scale setting on the lattice, but into QCD itself.",

      "summary": "Chiral perturbation theory for eigenvalue distributions, and equivalently random matrix theory, has recently been extended to include lattice effects for Wilson fermions. We test the predictions by comparison to eigenvalue distributions of the Hermitian Wilson-Dirac operator from pure gauge (quenched) ensembles. We show that the lattice effects are diminished when using clover improvement for the Dirac operator. We demonstrate that the leading Wilson low-energy constants associated with Wilson (clover) fermions can be determined using spectral information of the respective Dirac operator at finite volume.",

      "summary": "Composite dark matter candidates, which can arise from new strongly-coupled sectors, are well-motivated and phenomenologically interesting, particularly in the context of asymmetric generation of the relic density. In this work, we employ lattice calculations to study the electromagnetic form factors of electroweak-neutral dark-matter baryons for a three-color, QCD-like theory with Nf = 2 and 6 degenerate fermions in the fundamental representation. We calculate the (connected) charge radius and anomalous magnetic moment, both of which can play a significant role for direct detection of composite dark matter. We find minimal Nf dependence in these quantities. We generate mass-dependent cross-sections for dark matter-nucleon interactions and use them in conjunction with experimental results from XENON100, excluding dark matter candidates of this type with masses below 10 TeV.",

      "summary": "We investigate the eigenmodes of the massless Dirac operator to extract the scale-dependent fermion mass anomalous dimension gamma_m(mu). By combining simulations on multiple lattice volumes, and when possible several gauge couplings, we are able to measure the anomalous dimension across a wide range of energy scales. The method that we present is universal and can be applied to any lattice model of interest, including both conformal or chirally broken systems. We consider SU(3) lattice gauge theories with Nf=4, 8 and 12 light or massless fermions. The 4-flavor model behaves as expected for a QCD-like system and demonstrates that systematic effects are manageable in practical lattice calculations. Our 12-flavor results are consistent with the existence of an infrared fixed point, at which we predict the scheme-independent mass anomalous dimension gamma_m^*=0.32(3). For the 8-flavor model we observe a large anomalous dimension across a wide range of energy scales. Further investigation is required to determine whether Nf=8 is chirally broken and walking, or if it possesses a strongly-coupled conformal fixed point.",

      "summary": "The scalar strange-quark matrix element of the nucleon is computed with lattice QCD. A mixed-action scheme is used with domain-wall valence fermions computed on the staggered MILC sea-quark configurations. The matrix element is determined by making use of the Feynman-Hellmann theorem which relates this strange matrix element to the change in the nucleon mass with respect to the strange-quark mass. The final result of this calculation is m_s < N | s-bar s| N > = 49 +-10 +- 15 MeV and, correspondingly f_s = m_s < N | s-bar s |N > / m_N = 0.051 +- 0.011 +- 0.016. Given the lack of a quantitative comparison of this phenomenologically important quantity determined from various lattice QCD calculations, we take the opportunity to present such an average. The resulting conservative determination is f_s = 0.043 +- 0.011.",
