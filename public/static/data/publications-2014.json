      "summary": "We present results of our continuing study on mixed-action hadron spectra and decay constants using overlap valence quarks on MILC's 2+1+1 flavor HISQ gauge configurations. This study is carried out on three lattice spacings, with charm and strange masses tuned to their physical values, and with m_l/m_s = 1/5. We present results of an ongoing determination of the mixed-action parameter Delta_{mix}, which enters into chiral formulae for the masses and decay constants.",

      "summary": "We present a lattice QCD calculation of the glue spin $S_G$ in the nucleon for the first time. It was recently shown that the first moment of the glue helicity distribution could be obtained through the cross-product of the the electric field $\\vec{E}$ and the physical gauge field $\\vec{A}_{phys}$ with the non-Abelian Coulomb gauge condition, i.e. $\\int d^3 x\\, \\,\\vec{E}(x) \\times \\vec{A}_{phys}(x)$ in the infinite momentum frame. We use the gauge field tensor from the overlap Dirac operator to check the frame dependence and calculate glue spin with several momenta. The calculation is carried out with valence overlap fermion on 2+1 flavor DWF gauge configurations on the $24^3 \\times 64$ lattice with $a^{-1}=1.77$ GeV with the light sea quark mass corresponding to a pion mass of 330 MeV.",

      "summary": "We report on the status of our calculation of the hadronic matrix elements for neutral $B$-meson mixing with asqtad sea and valence light quarks and using the Wilson clover action with the Fermilab interpretation for the $b$ quark. We calculate the matrix elements of all five local operators that contribute to neutral $B$-meson mixing both in and beyond the Standard Model. We use MILC ensembles with $N_f=2+1$ dynamical flavors at four different lattice spacings in the range $a \\approx 0.045$--$0.12$~fm, and with light sea-quark masses as low as 0.05 times the physical strange quark mass. We perform a combined chiral-continuum extrapolation including the so-called wrong-spin contributions in simultaneous fits to the matrix elements of the five operators. We present a complete systematic error budget and conclude with an outlook for obtaining final results from this analysis.",

The fermion representation is real, and the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking is SU(2Nf) -> SO(2Nf) with Nf flavors of Dirac fermions. It is an interesting generalization of QCD, for several reasons: it allows direct exploration of an alternate large Nc expansion, it can be simulated at non-zero chemical potential with no sign problem, and several UV completions of composite Higgs systems are built on it. We present preliminary results on the baryon and meson spectra of the theory and compare them with SU(3) results and with expectations for large Nc scaling.",

      "summary": "The fermion bag is a powerful idea that helps to solve fermion lattice field theories using Monte Carlo methods. Some sign problems that had remained unsolved earlier can be solved within this framework. In this work we argue that the fermion bag also gives insight into a new mechanism of fermion mass generation, especially at strong couplings where fermion masses are related to the fermion bag size. On the other hand, chiral condensates arise due to zero modes in the Dirac operator within a fermion bag. Although in traditional four-fermion models the two quantities seem to be related, we show that they can be decoupled. While fermion bags become small at strong couplings, the ability of zero modes of the Dirac operator within fermion bags to produce a chiral condensate, can be suppressed by the presence of additional zero modes from other fermions. Thus, fermions can become massive even without a chiral condensate. This new mechanism of mass generation was discovered long ago in lattice field theory, but has remained unappreciated. Recent work suggests that it may be of interest even in continuum quantum field theory.",

At this stage, we evaluate only connected quark contributions. In particular, we discuss the nucleon vector and axial-vector form factors, nucleon axial charge and the isovector quark momentum fraction. From currently available statistics, we estimate the stochastic accuracy of the determination of $g_A$ and $<x>_{u-d}$ to be around 10%, and we expect to reduce that to 5% within the next year. To reduce the computational cost of our calculations, we extensively use acceleration techniques such as low-eigenmode deflation and all-mode-averaging (AMA). We present a method for choosing optimal AMA parameters.",

This problem can be alleviated by alternative algorithms that reduce the amount of data movement. We investigate this in the context of Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics and implement such an alternative solver algorithm, based on domain decomposition, on Intel Xeon Phi co-processor (KNC) clusters. We demonstrate close-to-linear on-chip scaling to all 60 cores of the KNC. With a mix of single- and half-precision the domain-decomposition method sustains 400-500 Gflop/s per chip. Compared to an optimized KNC implementation of a standard solver [1], our full multi-node domain-decomposition solver strong-scales to more nodes and reduces the time-to-solution by a factor of 5.",

Moreover, our results suggest that vSChSB occurs in two qualitatively different circumstances: there is a quark mass $m_c$ such that for $m > m_c$ the mode condensing Dirac spectrum exhibits standard monotonically increasing density, while for $m_{ch} < m < m_c$ the peak around zero separates from the bulk of the spectrum, with density showing a pronounced depletion at intermediate scales. Valence chiral symmetry restoration may occur at yet smaller masses $m < m_{ch}$, but this has not yet been seen by overlap valence probe, leaving the $m_{ch}=0$ possibility open. The latter option could place massless N$_f$=12 theory outside of conformal window. Anomalous behavior of overlap Dirac spectrum for $m_{ch} < m < m_c$ is qualitatively similar to one observed previously in zero and few-flavor theories as an effect of thermal agitation.",

Having dimension 5, the chromomagnetic operator is characterized by a rich pattern of mixing with operators of equal and lower dimensionality. The multiplicative renormalization factor as well as the mixing coefficients with the operators of equal dimension have been computed at one-loop in perturbation theory. The power divergent coefficients controlling the mixing with operators of lower dimension have been computed non-perturbatively, by imposing suitable subtraction conditions. The numerical simulations have been carried out using the gauge field configurations produced by the European Twisted Mass Collaboration with N_f=2+1+1 dynamical quarks at three values of the lattice spacing. Our preliminary result for the B-parameter of the chromomagnetic operator is B_{CMO}=0.29(11), which can be compared with the estimate B_{CMO}~1-4 currently used in phenomenological analyses.",

One can thus study a variety of quantum phase transitions that have remained unexplored so far due to sign problems.",

These random lines are modeled as being piece-wise linear and an ensemble is generated by Monte Carlo methods. The physical space in which the vortex lines are defined is a cuboid with periodic boundary conditions. Besides moving, growing and shrinking of the vortex configuration, also reconnections are allowed. Our ensemble therefore contains not a fixed, but a variable number of closed vortex lines. This is expected to be important for realizing the deconfining phase transition. Using the model, we study both vortex percolation and the potential V (R) between quark and anti-quark as a function of distance R at different vortex densities, vortex segment lengths, reconnection conditions and at different temperatures. We have found three deconfinement phase transitions, as a function of density, as a function of vortex segment length, and as a function of temperature. The model reproduces the qualitative features of confinement physics seen in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory.",

In order for Lattice QCD to offer insight into the interpretation of few-body states, a theoretical infrastructure must be developed to map Euclidean-time correlation functions to the desired Minkowski-time few-body observables. In this talk, I review the formal challenges associated with the studies of such systems via Lattice QCD, as first introduced by Maiani and Testa, and I also review the methodology to circumvent said limitations. The first main example of the latter is the formalism by Luscher to analyze elastic scattering and a second is the method by Lellouch and Luscher to analyze weak decays. I discus recent theoretical generalizations of these frameworks that allow for the determination of scattering amplitudes, resonances, nonlocal contribution to matrix elements, and form factors below and above inelastic thresholds. Finally, I outline outstanding problems, including those that are now beginning to be addressed.",

We use the MILC asqtad ensembles with $N_f=2+1$ sea quarks at four different lattice spacings in the range $a \\approx 0.045$~fm to $0.12$~fm. The lattice form factors are extrapolated to the continuum limit using SU(2) staggered chiral perturbation theory in the hard pion limit, followed by an extrapolation in $q^2$ to the full kinematic range using a functional $z$-parameterization. The extrapolation is combined with the experimental measurements of the partial branching fraction to extract $|V_{ub}|$. Our preliminary result is $|V_{ub}|=(3.72\\pm 0.14)\\times 10^{-3}$, where the error reflects both the lattice and experimental uncertainties, which are now on par with each other.",

If we neglect the plaquette interactions, we generate an effective theory where link variables are integrated out, producing 4-field operators. Plaquette interactions can be restored order by order as in recent calculations with staggered fermions. In the case of a SU(2) gauge theory with fermions, this strong coupling expansion can be related to the strong coupling expansion of Fermi-Hubbard models possibly implementable on optical lattice. We would like to provide a similar construction relating the U(1)-Higgs model to some Bose-Hubbard model. As a first step in this direction, we discuss a recent proposal to implement the O(2) model on optical lattices using a 87Rb and 41K Bose-Bose mixture of cold atoms.",

An alternative lattice fermion formalism, staggered fermions, does not have a conventional single-time-step transfer matrix. Nonetheless, with a simple modification, the variational method can also be applied to that formalism. In some cases the method also provides a mechanism for separating the commonly paired parity-partner states. We discuss the extension to staggered fermions and illustrate it by applying it to the calculation of the spectrum of charmed-antistrange mesons consisting of a clover charm quark and a staggered strange antiquark.",

An improved version of the Fermilab action, the Oktay-Kronfeld action, can be used to reduce heavy-quark discretization effects in calculations performed at the physical bottom and charm quark masses.

      "summary": "The idea of blocking in configuration space has played an important role in the development of the RG ideas. However, despite being half a century old and having had a huge intellectual impact, generic numerical methods to perform blocking for lattice models have progressed more slowly than sampling methods. Blocking may be essential to deal with near conformal situations. Typically, blocking methods have smaller statistical errors but larger systematic errors than sampling methods. This situation is evolving with recent developments based on the Tensor RG (TRG) method. We report recent results for spin and gauge lattice models obtained with this new method regarding searches for fixed points, calculations of critical exponents and resolutions of sign problems. An interesting model for comparison is the 2-dimensional O(2) model with a chemical potential which has a sign problem with conventional Monte Carlo but allows sampling with the worm algorithm and blocking with various TRG formulations. We compare the efficiency and accuracy of these two methods.",

      "summary": "We study the transition between spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and conformal behavior in the SU(3) theory with multiple fermion flavors. Instead of the traditional approach of changing the number of flavors, we keep the number of fermions fixed but lift the mass of a subset, keeping the remaining fermions near to the massless chiral limit. This way we can interpolate continuously between the conformal and chirally broken dynamics. In particular, we consider four light and eight heavy flavors and investigate the running/walking gauge coupling and the low energy meson spectrum, including the 0++ iso-singlet scalar state in this system. Our preliminary data reveal an iso-singlet scalar that is considerably lighter than the pion at large fermion mass but becomes heavier at smaller masses. This behavior is of particular phenomenological interest.",

Our study uses lattice QCD with $N_f=2+1$ light quark flavors to describe the non-perturbative thermal QCD medium between $140$MeV$<T<249$MeV and deploys lattice regularized non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) effective field theory to capture the physics of heavy quark bound states immersed therein. The spectral functions of the $^3S_1$ $(Υ)$ and $^3P_1$ $(χ_{b1})$ bottomonium states are extracted from Euclidean time Monte Carlo simulations using a novel Bayesian prescription, which provides higher accuracy than the Maximum Entropy Method. Based on a systematic comparison of interacting and free spectral functions we conclude that the ground states of both the S-wave $(Υ)$ and P-wave $(χ_{b1})$ channel survive up to $T=249$MeV. Stringent upper limits on the size of the in-medium modification of bottomonium masses and widths are provided.",

We observe significant in-medium modifications for the $φ$ and $D_s$ meson channels already at temperatures around the chiral crossover region.

Our primary results are $f_{D^+} = 212.6(0.4)({}^{+1.0}_{-1.2})\\ \\mathrm{MeV}$, $f_{D_s} = 249.0(0.3)({}^{+1.1}_{-1.5})\\ \\mathrm{MeV}$, and $f_{D_s}/f_{D^+} = 1.1712(10)({}^{+29}_{-32})$, where the errors are statistical and total systematic, respectively.

These quantization conditions are used, along with experimentally known scattering parameters of two-nucleon systems in the coupled 3S1-3D1 channels, to demonstrate the expected effect of a selection of twisted boundary conditions on the spectrum of the deuteron. It is shown that an order of magnitude reduction in the finite-volume corrections to the deuteron binding energy arise in moderate volumes with a proper choice of boundary conditions on the proton and the neutron, or by averaging the result of periodic and anti-periodic boundary conditions. These observations mean that a sub-percent accuracy can be achieved in the determination of the deuteron binding energy at (spatial) volumes as small as ~(9[fm])^3 in upcoming lattice QCD calculations of this nucleus with physical light-quark masses. The results reviewed in this talk are presented in details in Ref. [1].",

      "summary": "Coupled-channel $πK$ and $ηK$ scattering amplitudes are determined by studying the finite-volume energy spectra obtained from dynamical lattice QCD calculations. Using a large basis of interpolating operators, including both those resembling a $q\\bar{q}$ construction and those resembling a pair of mesons with relative momentum, a reliable excited-state spectrum can be obtained. Working at ${m_π=391\\,\\mathrm{MeV}}$, we find a gradual increase in the $J^P=0^+$ $πK$ phase-shift which may be identified with a broad scalar resonance that couples strongly to $πK$ and weakly to $ηK$. The low-energy behavior of this amplitude suggests a virtual bound-state that may be related to the $κ$ resonance. A bound state with $J^P=1^-$ is found very close to the $πK$ threshold energy, whose coupling to the $πK$ channel is compatible with that of the experimental $K^\\star(892)$. Evidence is found for a narrow resonance in $J^P=2^+$. Isospin--3/2 $πK$ scattering is also studied and non-resonant phase-shifts spanning the whole elastic scattering region are obtained.",

To assess the improvement, we extend previous numerical tests with heavy-meson masses by analyzing data generated on a finer ($a \\approx 0.12\\;$fm) lattice with the correct tadpole factors for the $c_5$ term in the action. We update the analyses of the inconsistency parameter and the hyperfine splittings for the rest and kinetic masses.",

We have also corrected an error in a two-loop anomalous dimension used to evolve results between different scales.

We find that the CP-violating phase of the continuum theory, which occurs for sufficiently large non-degeneracy, is continuously connected to the Aoki phase found in the lattice theory with degenerate quarks. Both for the Aoki and first-order scenarios, this results in a critical surface along which at least one of the pions is massless. In the pion spectrum, we focus mainly on the untwisted case, where there is competition between the effects of non-degeneracy and discretization errors.

The ground and the first excited states of scalar and tensor glueballs are identified unambiguously by using the variational method on the basis of large operator sets. We calculate their wave functions in the Coulomb gauge and use two lattices with different lattice spacings to check the discretization artifacts. For ground states, the radial wave functions are approximately Gaussian and the size of the tensor is twice as large as that of the scalar. For the first excited states, the radial nodes are clearly observed for both the scalar and the tensor glueballs, such that they can be interpreted as the first radial excitations. These observations may shed light on the theoretical understanding of the inner structure of glueballs.",

The components consist of the quark mass term, the quark energy term, the glue energy term and the trace anomaly term. We calculate these components of mesons with lattice QCD for the first time. The calculation is carried out with overlap fermion on $2+1$ flavor domain-wall fermion gauge configurations. We confirm that $\\sim 50\\%$ of the light pion mass comes from the quark mass and $\\sim 10\\%$ comes from the quark energy, whereas, the contributions are found to be the other way around for the $ρ$ mass. The combined glue components contribute $\\sim 40 - 50\\%$ for both mesons. It is interesting to observe that the quark mass contribution to the mass of the vector meson is almost linear in quark mass over a large quark mass region below the charm quark mass. For heavy mesons, the quark mass term dominates the masses, while the contribution from the glue components is about $400\\sim500$ MeV for the heavy pseudoscalar and vector mesons. The charmonium hyperfine splitting is found to be dominated by the quark energy term which is consistent with the quark potential model.",

We test the method using strange quark correlators calculated on MILC Collaboration's $n_f = 2+1+1$ HISQ ensembles at multiple values of the lattice spacing, multiple volumes and multiple light sea quark masses (including physical pion mass configurations). We find the (connected) contribution to the anomalous moment from the strange quark vacuum polarisation to be $a^s_μ=53.41(59)\\times 10^{-10}$, and the contribution from charm quarks to be $a^c_μ=14.42(39)\\times 10^{-10}$ - 1% accuracy is achieved for the strange quark contribution. The extension of our method to the light quark contribution and to that from the quark-line disconnected diagram is straightforward.",

These include a proof that only a single fine-tuning needs to be performed, so long as the moduli space is not lifted by nonperturbative effects. We extend our investigations of supersymmetry restoration in the continuum limit by initiating Monte Carlo renormalization group studies. We present additional numerical evidence that the lattice theory does not suffer from a sign problem. Finally we study the static potential, which we find to be Coulombic at both weak and strong coupling. We compare the static potential Coulomb coefficients to perturbation theory, including initial results for N=3 colors in addition to N=2.",

A discussion of the systematic uncertainties and the computation of the disconnected contributions using dynamical simulations is also included. Results emerging the properties of particles other than the nucleon are summarized, highlighting selected hyperon and meson form factors.",

      "summary": "We report on a preliminary scale determination with gradient-flow techniques on the $N_f = 2 + 1 + 1$ HISQ ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration. The ensembles include four lattice spacings, ranging from 0.15 to 0.06 fm, and both physical and unphysical values of the quark masses. The scales $\\sqrt{t_0}/a$ and $w_0/a$ are computed using Symanzik flow and the cloverleaf definition of $\\langle E \\rangle$ on each ensemble. Then both scales and the meson masses $aM_π$ and $aM_K$ are adjusted for mistunings in the charm mass. Using a combination of continuum chiral perturbation theory and a Taylor series ansatz in the lattice spacing, the results are simultaneously extrapolated to the continuum and interpolated to physical quark masses. Our preliminary results are $\\sqrt{t_0} = 0.1422(7)$fm and $w_0 = 0.1732(10)$fm. We also find the continuum mass-dependence of $w_0$.",

In addition to spatially-extended single-meson operators, large numbers of two-meson operators are used, involving a wide variety of light isovector, isoscalar, and strange meson operators of varying relative momenta.

A large set of baryonic operators that respect the symmetries of the lattice and are obtained after subduction from their continuum analogues are utilized.

The lattice spectra that we obtain have baryonic states with well-defined total spins up to 7/2 and the low lying states remarkably resemble the expectations of quantum numbers from SU(6) $\\otimes$ O(3) symmetry.

As such it provides a description of the Higgs sector of the standard model, in which the Higgs field is replaced by the Goldstone `pions' of this QCD-like theory, and the Higgs itself is the $σ$. Such a theory will need to be extended if it is to also give masses to the quarks and leptons. What we are attempting to determine is whether it is indeed QCD-like and hence walking, or if it has an infrared fixed point making it a conformal field theory. We do this by simulating its lattice version at finite temperature and observing the running of the bare (lattice) coupling at the chiral transition, as the lattice spacing is varied, and comparing this running with that predicted by 2-loop perturbation theory. Our results on lattices with temporal extents ($N_t$) up to 12 indicate that the coupling runs, but not as fast as asymptotic freedom predicts.

      "summary": "We describe a new technique (presented in arXiv:1403.1778) to determine the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) of the muon coming from the hadronic vacuum polarisation using lattice QCD. Our method uses Padé approximants to reconstruct the Adler function from its derivatives at $q^2=0$. These are obtained simply and accurately from time-moments of the vector current-current correlator at zero spatial momentum. We test the method using strange quark correlators calculated on MILC Collaboration's $n_f$ = 2+1+1 HISQ ensembles at multiple values of the lattice spacing, multiple volumes and multiple light sea quark masses (including physical pion mass configurations).",

      "summary": "We discuss the resolution of an inconsistency between lattice background field methods and nonrelativistic QED matching conditions. In particular, we show that lack of on-shell conditions in lattice QCD with time-dependent background fields generally requires that certain operators related by equations of motion should be retained in an effective field theory to correctly describe the behavior of Green's functions. The coefficients of such operators in a nonrelativistic hadronic theory are determined by performing a robust nonrelativistic expansion of QED for relativistic scalar and spin-half hadrons including nonminimal electromagnetic couplings. Provided that nonrelativistic QED is augmented with equation-of-motion operators, we find that the background field method can be reconciled with the nonrelativistic QED matching conditions without any inconsistency. We further investigate whether nonrelativistic QED can be employed in the analysis of lattice QCD correlation function in background fields, but we are confronted with difficulties. Instead, we argue that the most desirable approach is a hybrid one which relies on a relativistic hadronic theory with operators chosen based on their relevance in the nonrelativistic limit. Using this hybrid framework, we obtain practically useful forms of correlation functions for scalar and spin-half hadrons in uniform electric and magnetic fields.",

The highest temperature studied is approximately 1.4Tc. Up to this temperature no significant variation of the spectral function is seen in the PS channel. The V channel shows some temperature dependence, which seems to be consistent with a temperature dependent low frequency peak related to heavy quark transport, plus a temperature independent term at omega > 0.

The lattice action is constructed to exactly preserve a single supersymmetry charge at non-zero lattice spacing, up to additional potential terms included to stabilize numerical simulations. The software evolved from the MILC code for lattice QCD, and retains a similar large-scale framework despite the different target theory. Many routines are adapted from an existing serial code, which SUSY LATTICE supersedes. This paper provides an overview of the new parallel software, summarizing the lattice system, describing the applications that are currently provided and explaining their basic workflow for non-experts in lattice gauge theory. We discuss the parallel performance of the code, and highlight some notable aspects of the documentation for those interested in contributing to its future development.",

The model contains a $SU(4)$ symmetry which forbids non-zero fermion bilinear mass terms, due to which there is a massless fermion phase at weak couplings. However, even at strong couplings fermion bilinear condensates do not appear in our model, although fermions do become massive. While the existence of this exotic strongly coupled massive fermion phase was established long ago, the nature of the transition between the massless and the massive phase has remained unclear. Using Monte Carlo calculations in three space-time dimensions, we find evidence for a direct second order transition between the two phases suggesting that the exotic lattice phase may have a continuum limit at least in three dimensions. A similar exotic second order critical point was found recently in a bilayer system on a honeycomb lattice.",

Using the gradient flow running coupling, and comparing two different nHYP-smeared staggered lattice actions, we calculate the 8-flavor step-scaling function at significantly stronger couplings than were previously accessible. Our continuum-extrapolated results for the discrete beta function show no sign of an IR fixed point up to couplings of g^2~14. At the same time, we find that the gradient flow coupling runs much more slowly than predicted by two-loop perturbation theory, reinforcing previous indications that the 8-flavor system possesses nontrivial strongly coupled IR dynamics with relevance to BSM phenomenology.",

      "summary": "We have made significant progress on extending lattice QCD calculation of the polarizability of the neutron and other hadrons to include the effects of charged dynamical quarks. This is done by perturbatively reweighting the charges of the sea quarks to couple them to the background field. The dominant challenge in such a calculation is stochastic estimation of the weight factors, and we discuss the difficulties in this estimation. Here we use an extremely aggressive dilution scheme with N = 124,416 sources per configuration to reduce the stochastic noise to a manageable level. We find that α_E = 2.70(55) * 10^-4 fm^3 for the neutron on one ensemble. We show that low-mode substitution can be used in tandem with dilution to construct an even better estimator, and introduce the offdiagonal matrix element mapping technique for predicting estimator quality.",

      "summary": "We propose a \"locally-smeared Operator Product Expansion\" (sOPE) to decompose non-local operators in terms of a basis of locally-smeared operators. The sOPE formally connects nonperturbative matrix elements of smeared degrees of freedom, determined numerically using the gradient flow, to non-local operators in the continuum. The nonperturbative matrix elements do not suffer from power-divergent mixing on the lattice, provided the smearing scale is kept fixed in the continuum limit. The presence of this smearing scale prevents a simple connection to the standard operator product expansion and therefore requires the construction of a two-scale formalism. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using the example of real scalar field theory.",

      "summary": "We use overlap fermions as valence quarks to calculate meson masses in a wide quark mass range on the $2+1$-flavor domain-wall fermion gauge configurations generated by the RBC and UKQCD Collaborations. The well-defined quark masses in the overlap fermion formalism and the clear valence quark mass dependence of meson masses observed from the calculation facilitate a direct derivation of physical current quark masses through a global fit to the lattice data, which incorporates $O(a^2)$ and $O(m_c^4a^4)$ corrections, chiral extrapolation, and quark mass interpolation. Using the physical masses of $D_s$, $D_s^*$ and $J/ψ$ as inputs, Sommer's scale parameter $r_0$ and the masses of charm quark and strange quark in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme are determined to be $r_0=0.465(4)(9)$ fm, $m_c^{\\overline{\\rm MS}}(2\\,{\\rm GeV})=1.118(6)(24)$ GeV (or $m_c^{\\overline{\\rm MS}}(m_c)=1.304(5)(20)$ GeV), and $m_s^{\\overline{\\rm MS}}(2\\,{\\rm GeV})=0.101(3)(6)\\,{\\rm GeV}$, respectively. Furthermore, we observe that the mass difference of the vector meson and the pseudoscalar meson with the same valence quark content is proportional to the reciprocal of the square root of the valence quark masses. The hyperfine splitting of charmonium, $M_{J/ψ}-M_{η_c}$, is determined to be 119(2)(7) MeV, which is in good agreement with the experimental value. We also predict the decay constant of $D_s$ to be $f_{D_s}=254(2)(4)$ MeV. The masses of charmonium $P$-wave states $χ_{c0}, χ_{c1}$ and $h_c$ are also in good agreement with experiments.",

The reliable determination of such correlators is often hampered by an exponential degradation of signal/noise at late time separations. We demonstrate that it is sometimes possible to achieve significant enhancements of signal/noise by appropriately optimizing correlators with respect to the source and sink interpolating operators, and highlight the large range of possibilities that are available for this task. The ideas are discussed for both a toy model, and single hadron correlators in the context of quantum chromodynamics.",

      "summary": "Topological insulators are substances which are bulk insulators but which carry current via special \"topologically protected\" edge states. The understanding of long range topological order in these systems is built around the idea of a Berry connection, which is a gauge connection obtained from the phase of the electron wave function transported over momentum space rather than coordinate space. The phase of a closed Wilson loop of the Berry connection around the Brillouin zone defines a topological order parameter which labels discrete flux vacua. The conducting states are surface modes on the domain walls between discrete vacua. Evidence from large-$N_c$ chiral dynamics, holographic QCD, and Monte Carlo observations has pointed to a picture of the QCD vacuum that is very similar to that of a topological insulator, with discrete quasivacua labelled by $θ$ angles that differ by mod $2π$. In this picture, the domain walls are membranes of Chern-Simons charge, and the quark condensate consists of surface modes on these membranes, which are delocalized and thus support the long range propagation of Goldstone pions. The Berry phase in QED2 describes charge polarization of fermion-antifermion pairs, while in 4D QCD it describes the polarization of Chern-Simons membranes.",

The light degrees of freedom are represented by dynamical lattice QCD configurations of the HotQCD collaboration with $N_f = 2 + 1$ flavors. Bottomonium correlators are obtained from bottom quark propagators, computed in nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD) under the background of these gauge field configurations. The spectral functions for the $^3S_1$ ($Υ$) and $^3P_1$ ($χ_{b1}$) channel are extracted from the Euclidean time correlators using a novel Bayesian approach in the temperature region $140 {\\rm MeV} \\le T \\le 249 {\\rm MeV}$ and the results are contrasted to those from the standard maximum entropy method. We find that the new Bayesian approach is far superior to the maximum entropy method. It enables us to study reliably the presence or absence of the lowest state signal in the spectral function of a certain channel, even under the limitations present in the finite temperature setup. We find that $χ_{b1}$ survives up to $T=249 {\\rm MeV}$, the highest temperature considered in our study and put stringent constraints on the size of the medium modification of $Υ$ and $χ_{b1}$ states.",

These calculations, performed at quark masses corresponding to $m_π\\sim 800$ MeV, reveal that the structure of these nuclei at unphysically heavy quark masses closely resembles that at the physical quark masses. In particular, we find that the magnetic moment of ${}^3$He differs only slightly from that of a free neutron, as is the case in nature, indicating that the shell-model configuration of two spin-paired protons and a valence neutron captures its dominant structure. Similarly a shell-model-like moment is found for the triton, $μ_{{}^3{\\rm H}} \\sim μ_p$. The deuteron magnetic moment is found to be equal to the nucleon isoscalar moment within the uncertainties of the calculations.",

Using the gradient flow, we propose to calculate the QCD component of key beyond the Standard Model (BSM) matrix elements related to quark and strong theta CP violation and the strange content within the nucleon. The former set of matrix elements impacts our understanding of Electric Dipole Moments (EDMs) of nucleons and nuclei (a key signature of BSM physics), while the latter contributes to elastic recoil of Dark Matter particles off nucleons and nuclei. If successful, these results will lay the foundation for extraction of BSM observables from future low-energy, high-intensity and high-accuracy experimental measurements.",

      "summary": "Lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) will soon become the primary theoretical tool in rigorous studies of single- and multi-hadron sectors of QCD. It is truly ab initio meaning that its only parameters are those of standard model. The result of a lattice QCD calculation corresponds to that of nature only in the limit when the volume of spacetime is taken to infinity and the spacing between discretized points on the lattice is taken to zero. A better understanding of these discretization and volume effects not only provides the connection to the infinite-volume continuum observables, but also leads to optimized calculations that can be performed with available computational resources. This thesis includes various formal developments in this direction, along with proposals for improvements, to be applied to the upcoming lattice QCD studies of nuclear and hadronic systems. Among these developments are i) an analytical investigation of the recovery of rotational symmetry with the use of suitably-formed smeared operators toward the continuum limit, ii) an extension of the Luscher finite-volume method to two-nucleon systems with arbitrary angular momentum, spin, parity and center of mass momentum, iii) the application of such formalism in extracting the scattering parameters of the 3S1-3D1 coupled channels, iv) an investigation of twisted boundary conditions in the single- and two-hadron sectors, with proposals for improving the volume-dependence of the deuteron binding energy upon proper choices of boundary conditions, and v) exploring the volume dependence of the masses of hadrons and light-nuclei due to quantum electrodynamic interactions, including the effects arising from particles' compositeness. The required background as well as a brief status report of the field pertinent to the discussions in this thesis are presented.",

By exposing more parallelism to the accelerator through inverting multiple vectors at the same time we obtain a performance 250 GFlop/s on both architectures. This more than doubles the performance of the inversions. We give a short overview of both architectures, discuss some details of the implementation and the effort required to obtain the achieved performance.",

      "summary": "The dynamical effects of topological charge in two-dimensional QED can be expressed in terms of a topological order parameter via a Berry phase construction. The Berry phase describes the electric charge polarization of the vacuum in a manner similar to the theory of polarization in topological insulators. The topological order parameter labels discrete vacua which differ by units of electric flux. Here the associated Berry connection is explicitly constructed from the Dirac Hamiltonian eigenstates by introducing a small attractive Thirring coupling, so that there is still a stable boson in the limit of zero EM coupling. The Berry connection arises from the analytic structure of the Bethe ansatz states in complex rapidity near the free fermion point.",

We consider all possible combinations of charm and bottom quarks, and compute a total of 36 different states with $J^P = \\frac12^+$ and $J^P = \\frac32^+$. We use domain-wall fermions for the up, down, and strange quarks, a relativistic heavy-quark action for the charm quarks, and nonrelativistic QCD for the bottom quarks. Our analysis includes results from two different lattice spacings and seven different pion masses. We perform extrapolations of the baryon masses to the continuum limit and to the physical pion mass using $SU(4|2)$ heavy-hadron chiral perturbation theory including $1/m_Q$ and finite-volume effects. For the 14 singly heavy baryons that have already been observed, our results agree with the experimental values within the uncertainties. We compare our predictions for the hitherto unobserved states with other lattice calculations and quark-model studies.",

For systems of any number of identical pseudo-scalar mesons of maximal isospin, these inequalities prove that interactions between the constituent mesons must be repulsive and that no bound states can form in these channels. Similar constraints in less symmetric systems are also extracted. These results are compatible with experimental results (where known) and recent lattice QCD calculations, and also lead to a more stringent bound on the nucleon mass than previously derived, $m_N \\ge 3/2 m_π$.",

For Domain Wall Fermion action (DWF) we found that Modified Conjugate Residual(MCR) as the most efficient solver compared to CG and GCR.

      "summary": "The renormalization factors of local quark-bilinear operators are computed non-perturbatively for $N_f=3$ flavors of SLiNC fermions, with emphasis on the various procedures for the chiral and continuum extrapolations. The simulations are performed at a lattice spacing $a=0.074$ fm, and for five values of the pion mass in the range of 290-465 MeV, allowing a safe and stable chiral extrapolation. Emphasis is given in the subtraction of the well-known pion pole which affects the renormalization factor of the pseudoscalar current. We also compute the inverse propagator and the Green's functions of the local bilinears to one loop in perturbation theory. We investigate lattice artifacts by computing them perturbatively to second order as well as to all orders in the lattice spacing. The renormalization conditions are defined in the RI$'$-MOM scheme, for both the perturbative and non-perturbative results. The renormalization factors, obtained at different values of the renormalization scale, are translated to the ${\\bar{\\rm MS}}$ scheme and are evolved perturbatively to 2 GeV. Any residual dependence on the initial renormalization scale is eliminated by an extrapolation to the continuum limit. We also study the various sources of systematic errors.\n  Particular care is taken in correcting the non-perturbative estimates by subtracting lattice artifacts computed to one loop perturbation theory using the same action. We test two different methods, by subtracting either the ${\\cal O}(g^2\\,a^2)$ contributions, or the complete (all orders in $a$) one-loop lattice artifacts.",

We consider a relativistic scalar field theory in which the couplings are arbitrary aside from a Z2 symmetry that removes vertices with an odd number of particles. The theory is assumed to have two-particle phase shifts that are bounded by π/2 in the regime of elastic scattering. We determine the spectrum of the finite-volume theory from the poles in the odd-particle-number finite-volume correlator, which we analyze to all orders in perturbation theory. We show that it depends on the infinite-volume two-to-two K-matrix as well as a nonstandard infinite-volume three-to-three K-matrix. A key feature of our result is the need to subtract physical singularities in the three-to-three amplitude and thus deal with a divergence-free quantity. This allows our initial, formal result to be truncated to a finite dimensional determinant equation. At present, the relation of the three-to-three K-matrix to the corresponding scattering amplitude is not known, although previous results in the non-relativistic limit suggest that such a relation exists.",

      "summary": "Computing platforms equipped with accelerators like GPUs have proven to provide great computational power. However, exploiting such platforms for existing scientific applications is not a trivial task. Current GPU programming frameworks such as CUDA C/C++ require low-level programming from the developer in order to achieve high performance code. As a result porting of applications to GPUs is typically limited to time-dominant algorithms and routines, leaving the remainder not accelerated which can open a serious Amdahl's law issue. The lattice QCD application Chroma allows to explore a different porting strategy. The layered structure of the software architecture logically separates the data-parallel from the application layer. The QCD Data-Parallel software layer provides data types and expressions with stencil-like operations suitable for lattice field theory and Chroma implements algorithms in terms of this high-level interface. Thus by porting the low-level layer one can effectively move the whole application in one swing to a different platform. The QDP-JIT/PTX library, the reimplementation of the low-level layer, provides a framework for lattice QCD calculations for the CUDA architecture. The complete software interface is supported and thus applications can be run unaltered on GPU-based parallel computers. This reimplementation was possible due to the availability of a JIT compiler (part of the NVIDIA Linux kernel driver) which translates an assembly-like language (PTX) to GPU code. The expression template technique is used to build PTX code generators and a software cache manages the GPU memory. This reimplementation allows us to deploy an efficient implementation of the full gauge-generation program with dynamical fermions on large-scale GPU-based machines such as Titan and Blue Waters which accelerates the algorithm by more than an order of magnitude.",

We extract new values for the QCD coupling and for the $c$ quark's $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ mass: $α_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}(M_Z,n_f=5) = 0.11822(74)$ and $m_c(3\\mathrm{GeV}, n_f=4) = 0.9851(63)$GeV. These agree well with our earlier simulations using $n_f=3$ sea quarks, vindicating the perturbative treatment of $c$ quarks in that analysis. We also obtain a new nonperturbative result for the ratio of $c$~and $s$~quark masses: $m_c/m_s=11.652(65)$. This ratio implies $m_s(2\\,\\mathrm{GeV}, n_f=3)=93.6(8)$MeV when it is combined with our new~$c$~mass. Combining $m_c/m_s$ with our earlier $m_b/m_c$ gives $m_b/m_s=52.55(55)$, which is several standard deviations (but only 4%) away from the Georgi-Jarlskop prediction from certain GUTs. Finally we obtain an $n_f=4$ estimate for $m_b/m_c=4.528(54)$ which agrees well with our earlier $n_f=3$ result. The new ratio implies~$m_b(m_b,n_f=5)=4.162(48)$GeV.",

The comparison emphasises that experiment is sensitive to the momentum dependence of the running couplings and masses in the strong interaction sector of the Standard Model and highlights that the key to describing hadron properties is a veracious expression of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the bound-state problem. Amongst the results we describe, the following are of particular interest: $G_E^p(Q^2)/G_M^p(Q^2)$ possesses a zero at $Q^2=9.5GeV^2$; any change in the interaction which shifts a zero in the proton ratio to larger $Q^2$ relocates a zero in $G_E^n(Q^2)/G_M^n(Q^2)$ to smaller $Q^2$; and there is likely a value of momentum transfer above which $G_E^n>G_E^p$. Regarding the $Δ(1232)$-baryon, we find that, inter alia: the electric monopole form factor exhibits a zero; the electric quadrupole form factor is negative, large in magnitude, and sensitive to the nature and strength of correlations in the $Δ(1232)$ Faddeev amplitude; and the magnetic octupole form factor is negative so long as rest-frame P- and D-wave correlations are included. In connection with the N-to-Delta transition, the momentum-dependence of the magnetic transition form factor, $G_M^\\ast$, matches that of $G_M^n$ once the momentum transfer is high enough to pierce the meson-cloud; and the electric quadrupole ratio is a keen measure of diquark and orbital angular momentum correlations.",

      "summary": "We employ the lattice QCD data on Taylor expansion coefficients up to sixth order to construct an equation of state at finite net-baryon density. When we take into account how hadron masses depend on lattice spacing and quark mass, the coefficients evaluated using the p4 action are equal to those of hadron resonance gas at low temperature. Thus the parametrised equation of state can be smoothly connected to the hadron resonance gas equation of state. We see that the equation of state using Taylor coefficients up to second order is realistic only at low densities, and that at densities corresponding to s/n_B > 40, the expansion converges by the sixth order term.",

      "summary": "We show that inconsistency between background field methods, which are relevant for lattice QCD spectroscopy, and effective field theory matching conditions, which are obtained from scattering amplitudes, can be resolved by augmenting nonrelativistic QED with operators related by the equations of motion. To determine the coefficients of such operators, we perform the nonrelativistic expansion of QED for a spin-half hadron including non-minimal electromagnetic couplings. As an effective field theory framework could provide a valuable tool to analyze lattice QCD correlation functions in external fields, we investigate whether nonrelativistic QED can be used to this end. We argue, however, that the most desirable approach is a hybrid one, which combines a relativistic hadron theory with operator selection based on nonrelativistic QED power counting. In this hybrid framework, new results are obtained for charged spin-half hadrons in uniform magnetic fields, including a proper treatment of Landau levels both in infinite volume and on a torus.",

The lessons learned from the lattice radial quantization of the 3D Ising model on a longitudinal cylinder with 2D Icosahedral cross-section suggested the need for an improved discretization. We consider here the use of the Finite Element Methods(FEM) to descretize the universally-equivalent $φ^4$ Lagrangian on $\\mathbb R \\times \\mathbb S^2$. It is argued that this lattice regularization will approach the exact conformal theory at the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in the continuum. Numerical tests are underway to support this conjecture.",

While in infinite volume, QED contributions to low-energy charged particle scattering must be resummed to all orders in perturbation theory (the Coulomb ladder diagrams), in a finite volume the momentum operator is gapped, allowing for a perturbative treatment. The leading QED corrections to the two-particle finite-volume energy quantization condition below the inelastic threshold, as well as approximate formulas for energy eigenvalues, are obtained. In particular, we focus on two spinless hadrons in the A1+ irreducible representation of the cubic group, and truncate the strong interactions to the s-wave. These results are necessary for the analysis of Lattice QCD+QED calculations of charged-hadron interactions, and can be straightforwardly generalized to other representations of the cubic group, to hadrons with spin, and to include higher partial waves.",

      "summary": "Hadronic matrix elements that depend on momentum are required for numerous phenomenological applications. Probing the low-momentum regime is often problematic for lattice QCD computations on account of the restriction to periodic momentum modes. Recently a novel method has been proposed to compute matrix elements at zero momentum, for which straightforward evaluation of the matrix elements would otherwise yield a vanishing result. We clarify an assumption underlying this method, and thereby establish the theoretical framework required to address the associated finite volume effects. Using the pion electromagnetic form factor as an example, we show how the charge radius and two higher moments can be calculated at zero momentum transfer, and determine the corresponding finite volume effects. These computations are performed using chiral perturbation theory to account for modified infrared physics, and can be generalized to ascertain finite volume effects for other hadronic matrix elements extracted at zero momentum.",

      "summary": "We compute the leptonic decay constants $f_{D^+}$, $f_{D_s}$, and $f_{K^+}$, and the quark-mass ratios $m_c/m_s$ and $m_s/m_l$ in unquenched lattice QCD using the experimentally determined value of $f_{π^+}$ for normalization. We use the MILC highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) ensembles with four dynamical quark flavors---up, down, strange, and charm---and with both physical and unphysical values of the light sea-quark masses. The use of physical pions removes the need for a chiral extrapolation, thereby eliminating a significant source of uncertainty in previous calculations. Four different lattice spacings ranging from $a\\approx 0.06$ fm to $0.15$ fm are included in the analysis to control the extrapolation to the continuum limit. Our primary results are $f_{D^+} = 212.6(0.4)({}^{+1.0}_{-1.2})\\ \\mathrm{MeV}$, $f_{D_s} = 249.0(0.3)({}^{+1.1}_{-1.5})\\ \\mathrm{MeV}$, and $f_{D_s}/f_{D^+} = 1.1712(10)({}^{+29}_{-32})$, where the errors are statistical and total systematic, respectively. The errors on our results for the charm decay constants and their ratio are approximately two to four times smaller than those of the most precise previous lattice calculations. We also obtain $f_{K^+}/f_{π^+} = 1.1956(10)({}^{+26}_{-18})$, updating our previous result, and determine the quark-mass ratios $m_s/m_l = 27.35(5)({}^{+10}_{-7})$ and $m_c/m_s = 11.747(19)({}^{+59}_{-43})$. When combined with experimental measurements of the decay rates, our results lead to precise determinations of the CKM matrix elements $|V_{us}| = 0.22487(51) (29)(20)(5)$, $|V_{cd}|=0.217(1) (5)(1)$ and $|V_{cs}|= 1.010(5)(18)(6)$, where the errors are from this calculation of the decay constants, the uncertainty in the experimental decay rates, structure-dependent electromagnetic corrections, and, in the case of $|V_{us}|$, the uncertainty in $|V_{ud}|$, respectively.",

      "summary": "We present a lattice QCD calculation of the polarizability of the neutron and other neutral hadrons that includes the effects of the background field on the sea quarks. This is done by perturbatively reweighting the charges of the sea quarks to couple them to the background field. The main challenge in such a calculation is stochastic estimation of the weight factors, and we discuss the difficulties in this estimation. Here we use an extremely aggressive dilution scheme to reduce the stochastic noise to a manageable level. The pion mass in our calculation is 306 MeV and the lattice size is 3 fm. For neutron, we find that $α_E = 2.70(55) * 10^{-4}fm^3$, which is the most precise lattice QCD determination of the polarizability to date that includes sea effects.",

      "summary": "Neutral $B$ meson mixing matrix elements and $B$ meson decay constants are calculated. Static approximation is used for $b$ quark and domain-wall fermion formalism is employed for light quarks. The calculations are carried out on $2+1$ flavor dynamical ensembles generated by RBC/UKQCD Collaborations with lattice spacings $0.086$fm ($a^{-1}\\sim 2.3$GeV) and $0.11$fm ($1.7$GeV), and a fixed physical spatial volume of about $(2.7{\\rm fm})^3$. In the static quark action, link-smearings are used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. We employ two kinds of link-smearings, HYP1 and HYP2, and their results are combined in taking the continuum limit. For the matching between the lattice and the continuum theory, one-loop perturbative $O(a)$ improvements are made to reduce discretization errors. As the most important quantity of this work, we obtain SU(3) breaking ratio $ξ=1.208(60)$, where the error includes statistical and systematic one. (Uncertainty from infinite $b$ quark mass is not included.) We also find other neutral $B$ meson mixing quantities $f_B\\sqrt{\\hat{B}_B}=240(22)$MeV, $f_{B_s}\\sqrt{\\hat{B}_{B_s}}=290(22)$MeV, $\\hat{B}_B=1.17(22)$, $\\hat{B}_{B_s}=1.22(13)$ and $B_{B_s}/B_B=1.028(74)$, $B$ meson decay constants $f_B=219(17)$MeV, $f_{B_s}=264(19)$MeV and $f_{B_s}/f_B=1.193(41)$, in the static limit of $b$ quark, which do not include infinite $b$ quark mass uncertainty.",

      "summary": "We perform a model-independent, non-perturbative investigation of two-point and three-point finite-volume correlation functions in the energy regime where two-particle states can go on-shell. We study three-point functions involving a single incoming particle and an outgoing two-particle state, relevant, for example, for studies of meson decays (e.g., B-to-pi Kll) or meson photo production (e.g., pi gamma-to-pi pi). We observe that, while the spectrum solely depends on the on-shell scattering amplitude, the correlation functions also depend on off-shell amplitudes. The main result of this work is a generalization of the Lellouch-Luscher formula relating matrix elements of currents in finite and infinite spatial volumes. We extend that work by considering a theory with multiple, strongly-coupled channels and by accommodating external currents which inject arbitrary four-momentum as well as arbitrary angular momentum. The result is exact up to exponentially suppressed corrections governed by the pion mass times the box size. We also apply our master equation to various examples, including the two processes mentioned above as well as examples where the final state is an admixture of two open channels.",

      "title": "Nuclear Reactions from Lattice QCD",
      "summary": "One of the overarching goals of nuclear physics is to rigorously compute properties of hadronic systems directly from the fundamental theory of strong interactions, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In particular, the hope is to perform reliable calculations of nuclear reactions which will impact our understanding of environments that occur during big bang nucleosynthesis, the evolution of stars and supernovae, and within nuclear reactors and high energy/density facilities. Such calculations, being truly ab initio, would include all two-nucleon and three- nucleon (and higher) interactions in a consistent manner. Currently, lattice QCD provides the only reliable option for performing calculations of some of the low- energy hadronic observables. With the aim of bridging the gap between lattice QCD and nuclear many-body physics, the Institute for Nuclear Theory held a workshop on Nuclear Reactions from Lattice QCD on March 2013. In this review article, we report on the topics discussed in this workshop and the path planned to move forward in the upcoming years.",

We show that the autocorrelation functions of these observables obey a simple diffusion equation and we measure the diffusion coefficient, finding that it scales like the square of the lattice spacing. We use this result and measurements of the rate of tunneling between topological charge sectors to calculate the scaling behavior of the autocorrelation times of these observables on periodic and open lattices. There is a characteristic lattice spacing at which open boundary conditions become worthwhile for reducing autocorrelations and we show how this lattice spacing is related to the diffusion coefficient, the tunneling rate, and the lattice Euclidean time extent.",

      "summary": "We report the first lattice QCD calculation of the form factors for the standard model tree-level decay $B_s\\to K \\ellν$. In combination with future measurement, this calculation will provide an alternative exclusive semileptonic determination of $|V_{ub}|$. We compare our results with previous model calculations, make predictions for differential decay rates and branching fractions, and predict the ratio of differential branching fractions between $B_s\\to Kτν$ and $B_s\\to Kμν$. We also present standard model predictions for differential decay rate forward-backward asymmetries, polarization fractions, and calculate potentially useful ratios of $B_s\\to K$ form factors with those of the fictitious $B_s\\toη_s$ decay. Our lattice simulations utilize NRQCD $b$ and HISQ light quarks on a subset of the MILC Collaboration's $2+1$ asqtad gauge configurations, including two lattice spacings and a range of light quark masses.",

      "summary": "We have been studying QCD with 2 flavours of colour-sextet quarks as a candidate walking-Technicolor theory using lattice-QCD simulations. The evolution of the coupling constant with lattice spacing is measured at the finite-temperature chiral transition to determine if this theory is asymptotically free and hence QCD-like. The lattice spacing is varied by changing the number of lattice sites, $N_t$, in the Euclidean time direction. QCD with 3 flavours is studied for comparison. Since this theory is expected to be conformal, with an infrared fixed point, the coupling constant at the chiral transition should approach a non-zero value as $N_t$ becomes large. Our earlier simulations on lattices with $N_t=4$ and $N_t=6$ exhibited a significant decrease in coupling at the chiral transition as $N_t$ was increased. We have now extended these simulations to $N_t=8$, and performed additional simulations at $N_t=6$ to measure the coupling constant at the chiral transition more precisely. These indicate that while there is an appreciable decrease in coupling between $N_t=6$ and $N_t=8$, this is much smaller than that between $N_t=4$ and $N_t=6$. Thus we are hopeful that we are approaching the large-$N_t$ limit. However, further simulations at larger $N_t$(s) are needed.",

Using the domain wall fermion formulation, we investigate the light hadron spectrum, chiral condensate and electroweak S parameter. We consider a range of light fermion masses on two lattice volumes at a single gauge coupling chosen so that IR scales approximately match those from our previous studies of the two- and six-flavor systems. Our results for the Nf=8 spectrum suggest spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, though fits to the fermion mass dependence of spectral quantities do not strongly disfavor the hypothesis of mass-deformed infrared conformality. Compared to Nf=2 we observe a significant enhancement of the chiral condensate relative to the symmetry breaking scale F, similar to the situation for Nf=6. The reduction of the S parameter, related to parity doubling in the vector and axial-vector channels, is also comparable to our six-flavor results.",

      "summary": "Motivated by the application of Lüscher's finite volume method to the study of the lightest scalar resonance in the $ππ\\to ππ$ isoscalar channel, in this article we describe our studies of multi-pion correlation functions computed using stochastic propagators in quenched lattice QCD, harnessing GPUs for acceleration. We consider two methods for constructing the correlation functions. One \"outer product\" approach becomes quite expensive at large lattice extent $L$, having an ${\\cal O}(L^7)$ scaling. The other \"stochastic operator\" approach scales as ${\\cal O}(N_r^2 L^4)$, where $N_r$ is the number of random sources. It would become more efficient if variance reduction techniques are used and the volume is fairly large. It is also found that correlations between stochastic propagators appearing in the same diagram, when a single set of random source vectors is used, lead to much larger errors than if separate random sources are used for each propagator. The calculations involve states with quantum numbers of the vacuum, so all-to-all propagators must be computed. For this reason, GPUs are ideally suited to accelerating the calculation. For this work we have integrated the Columbia Physics System (CPS) and QUDA GPU inversion library, in the case of clover fermions. Finally, we show that the completely quark disconnected diagram is crucial to the results, and that neglecting it would lead to answers which are far from the true value for the effective mass in this channel. This is unfortunate, because as we also show, this diagram has very large errors, and in fact dominates the error budget.",

      "summary": "Hadron masses can be decomposed as a sum of quark and glue components which are defined through hadronic matrix elements of QCD operators. The components consist of the quark mass term, the quark energy term, the glue energy term, and the trace anomaly term. We calculate these components for mesons with lattice QCD for the first time. The calculation is carried out with overlap fermion on $2+1$ flavor domain-wall fermion gauge configurations. We confirm that $\\sim 50\\%$ of the light pion mass comes from the quark mass term and $\\sim 10\\%$ comes from the quark energy; whereas, while for the $ρ$ meson, the quark energy contributes roughly half of its mass but the quark mass term contributes little. The combined glue components contribute $\\sim 40 - 50\\%$ for both mesons. It is interesting to observe that the quark mass contribution to the mass of the vector meson is almost linear in quark mass over a large quark mass region below the charm quark mass. For heavy mesons, the quark mass term dominates the masses, while the contribution from the glue components is about $200$ MeV (a bare value around 2GeV) for the heavy pseudoscalar and vector mesons. The charmonium hyperfine splitting is found to be dominated by the quark energy term which is consistent with the picture of the quark potential model.",

      "summary": "It was recently conjectured that, in SU(3) gauge theories with fundamental quarks, valence spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is equivalent to condensation of local dynamical chirality and appearance of chiral polarization scale $Λ_{ch}$. Here we consider more general association involving the low-energy layer of chirally polarized modes which, in addition to its width ($Λ_{ch}$), is also characterized by volume density of participating modes ($Ω$) and the volume density of total chirality ($Ω_{ch}$). Few possible forms of the correspondence are discussed, paying particular attention to singular cases where $Ω$ emerges as the most versatile characteristic. The notion of finite-volume \"order parameter\", capturing the nature of these connections, is proposed. We study the effects of temperature (in N$_f$=0 QCD) and light quarks (in N$_f$=12), both in the regime of possible symmetry restoration, and find agreement with these ideas. In N$_f$=0 QCD, results from several volumes indicate that, at the lattice cutoff studied, the deconfinement temperature $T_c$ is strictly smaller than the overlap-valence chiral transition temperature $T_{ch}$ in real Polyakov line vacuum. Somewhat similar intermediate phase (in quark mass) is also seen in N$_f$=12. It is suggested that deconfinement in N$_f$=0 is related to indefinite convexity of absolute X-distributions.",

We demonstrate the potential of the approach with a generic two-state system, and then explore the practical applicability of the method for single hadron correlators in lattice quantum chromodynamics. In the latter case, we determine the ground state energies of the pion, proton, and delta baryon, as well as the ground and first excited state energy of the rho meson using matrices of correlators computed on an exemplary ensemble of anisotropic gauge configurations. In the majority of cases, we find a modest reduction in the statistical uncertainties on extracted energies compared to conventional variational techniques. However, in the case of the delta baryon, we achieve a factor of three reduction in statistical uncertainties. The variety of outcomes achieved for single hadron correlators illustrates an inherent dependence of the method on the properties of the system under consideration and the operator basis from which the correlators are constructed.",

      "summary": "Parton physics, when formulated as light-front correlations, are difficult to study non-perturbatively, despite the promise of light-front quantization. Recently an alternative approach to partons have been proposed by re-visiting original Feynman picture of a hadron moving at asymptotically large momentum. Here I formulate the approach in the language of an effective field theory for a large hadron momentum $P$ in lattice QCD, LaMET for short. I show that using this new effective theory, parton properties, including light-front parton wave functions, can be extracted from lattice observables in a systematic expansion of $1/P$, much like that the parton distributions can be extracted from the hard scattering data at momentum scales of a few GeV.",

      "summary": "We compare lattice QCD results for appropriate combinations of net strangeness fluctuations and their correlations with net baryon number fluctuations with predictions from two hadron resonance gas (HRG) models having different strange hadron content. The conventionally used HRG model based on experimentally established strange hadrons fails to describe the lattice QCD results in the hadronic phase close to the QCD crossover. Supplementing the conventional HRG with additional, experimentally uncharted strange hadrons predicted by quark model calculations and observed in lattice QCD spectrum calculations leads to good descriptions of strange hadron thermodynamics below the QCD crossover. We show that the thermodynamic presence of these additional states gets imprinted in the yields of the ground-state strange hadrons leading to a systematic 5--8 MeV decrease of the chemical freeze-out temperatures of ground-state strange baryons.",

      "summary": "We calculate the B-meson decay constants f_B, f_Bs, and their ratio in unquenched lattice QCD using domain-wall light quarks and relativistic b-quarks. We use gauge-field ensembles generated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations using the domain-wall fermion action and Iwasaki gauge action with three flavors of light dynamical quarks. We analyze data at two lattice spacings of a ~ 0.11, 0.086 fm with unitary pion masses as light as M_pi ~ 290 MeV; this enables us to control the extrapolation to the physical light-quark masses and continuum. For the b-quarks we use the anisotropic clover action with the relativistic heavy-quark interpretation, such that discretization errors from the heavy-quark action are of the same size as from the light-quark sector. We renormalize the lattice heavy-light axial-vector current using a mostly nonperturbative method in which we compute the bulk of the matching factor nonperturbatively, with a small correction, that is close to unity, in lattice perturbation theory. We also improve the lattice heavy-light current through O(alpha_s a). We extrapolate our results to the physical light-quark masses and continuum using SU(2) heavy-meson chiral perturbation theory, and provide a complete systematic error budget. We obtain f_B0 = 199.5(12.6) MeV, f_B+ = 195.6(14.9) MeV, f_Bs = 235.4(12.2) MeV, f_Bs/f_B0 = 1.197(50), and f_Bs/f_B+ = 1.223(71), where the errors are statistical and total systematic added in quadrature. These results are in good agreement with other published results and provide an important independent cross check of other three-flavor determinations of $B$-meson decay constants using staggered light quarks.",

      "summary": "Ratios of cumulants of conserved net charge fluctuations are sensitive to the degrees of freedom that are carriers of the corresponding quantum numbers in different phases of strong interaction matter. Using lattice QCD with 2+1 dynamical flavors and quenched charm quarks we calculate second and fourth order cumulants of net charm fluctuations and their correlations with other conserved charges such as net baryon number, electric charge and strangeness. Analyzing appropriate ratios of these cumulants we probe the nature of charmed degrees of freedom in the vicinity of the QCD chiral crossover region. We show that for temperatures above the chiral crossover transition temperature, charmed degrees of freedom can no longer be described by an uncorrelated gas of hadrons. This suggests that the dissociation of open charm hadrons and the emergence of deconfined charm states sets in just near the chiral crossover transition. Till the crossover region we compare these lattice QCD results with two hadron resonance gas models --including only the experimentally established charmed resonances and also including additional states predicted by quark model and lattice QCD calculations. This comparison provides evidence for so far unobserved charmed hadrons that contribute to the thermodynamics in the crossover region.",

      "summary": "A recent numerical lattice calculation of the kaon mixing matrix elements of general $ΔS=2$ four-fermion operators using staggered fermions relied on two auxiliary theoretical calculations. Here we describe the methodology and present the results of these two calculations. The first concerns one-loop matching coefficients between staggered lattice operators and the corresponding continuum operators. Previous calculations with staggered fermions have used a non-standard regularization scheme for the continuum operators, and here we provide the additional matching factors needed to connect to the standard regularization scheme. This is the scheme in which two-loop anomalous dimensions are known. We also observe that all previous calculations of this operator matching using staggered fermions have overlooked one matching step in the continuum. This extra step turns out to have no impact on three of the five operators (including that relevant for $B_K$), but does affect the other two operators. The second auxiliary calculation concerns the two-loop renormalization group (RG) evolution equations for the $B$-parameters of the $ΔS=2$ operators. For one pair of operators, the standard analytic solution to the two-loop RG equations fails due to a spurious singularity introduced by the approximations made in the calculation. We give a non-singular expression derived using analytic continuation, and check the result using a numerical solution to the RG equations. We also describe the RG evolution for \"golden\" combinations of $B$-parameters, and give numerical results for RG evolution matrices needed in the companion lattice calculation.",

      "summary": "We introduce a non-perturbative improvement for the renormalization group step scaling function based on the gradient flow running coupling, which may be applied to any lattice gauge theory of interest. Considering first SU(3) gauge theory with $N_f = 4$ massless staggered fermions, we demonstrate that this improvement can remove $O(a^2)$ lattice artifacts, and thereby increases our control over the continuum extrapolation. Turning to the 12-flavor system, we observe an infrared fixed point in the infinite-volume continuum limit. Applying our proposed improvement reinforces this conclusion by removing all observable $O(a^2)$ effects. For the finite-volume gradient flow renormalization scheme defined by $c = \\sqrt{8t} / L = 0.2$, we find the continuum conformal fixed point to be located at $g_\\star^2 = 6.2(2)$",

The uncertainties come from two sources: the truncation of perturbation theory and the uncertainties in input parameters. We review the current status of perturbative calculations and note that these are already reaching the parts-per-mil level of accuracy for the major decay modes. The main sources of uncertainty will then come from the parametric dependences on alpha_s, m_b, and m_c. Knowledge of these parameters is systematically improvable through lattice gauge theory calculations. We estimate the precision that lattice QCD will achieve in the next decade and the corresponding precision of the Standard Model predictions for Higgs boson partial widths.",

A unique aspect of this mixing calculation is the definition of the glue EM tensor operator. The glue operator is comprised of gauge-field tensors constructed from the overlap Dirac operator. The resulting perturbative calculations are performed using methods similar to the Kawai approach using the Wilson action for all QCD vertices and the overlap Dirac operator to define the glue EM tensor.

The light sea quark mass corresponds to a pion mass of 330 MeV. The mass of the Roper, chirally extrapolated to the physical pion mass, is 1404(112) MeV which is consistent with the experimental value at 1440 MeV. When compared to the Roper state calculation with variational method for Clover and twisted mass fermions, it is found that the Roper states from SEB with overlap fermion are systematically lower by 400 - 800 MeV for all the quark masses ranging from light to the strange mass region. We study the origin of the difference by exploring the size of the interpolation field in relation to the radial wavefunction of the Roper and also the dynamical influence of the higher Fock space.",

Our previous analysis \\cite{Bazavov:2011aa} computed the decay constants at lattice spacings $a \\approx 0.14, 0.11$ and $0.083$ fm. We have extended the simulations to finer $a \\approx 0.058$ and $0.043$ fm lattice spacings, and have also increased statistics; this allows us to address many important sources of uncertainty. Technical advances include a two-step two-point fit procedure, better tuning of the heavy quark masses and a better determination of the axial-vector current matching. The present analysis remains blinded, so here we focus on the improvements and their predicted impact on the error budget compared to the prior analysis.",

The strong suppression of the decay constant of the second excited state is consistent with its interpretation as a predominantly hybrid state.",

      "summary": "We present the first observation of a flavor-singlet scalar meson as light as the pion in $N_f=8$ QCD on the lattice, using the Highly Improved Staggered Quark action. Such a light scalar meson can be regarded as a composite Higgs with mass 125 GeV. In accord with our previous lattice results showing that the theory exhibits walking behavior, the light scalar may be a technidilaton, a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson of the approximate scale symmetry in walking technicolor.",

Wave functions of hadrons and their excitations may also be studied in lattice QCD, and I illustrate it with two recent examples of such calculations.

All lattice simulations are performed for a system of 2+1 dynamical quark flavors, at the physical mass for light and strange quarks; all results are continuum extrapolated. We show that it is possible to extract an upper value for the freeze-out temperature, as well as precise baryo-chemical potential values corresponding to the four highest collision energies of the experimental beam energy scan. Consistency between the freeze-out parameters obtained from baryon number and electric charge fluctuations is found. The freeze-out chemical potentials are now in agreement with the statistical hadronization model.",

This technique is expected to be particularly useful in situations where relatively few tunneling events are observed. Restriction to a lattice subvolume on which topological charge is not quantized is explored, and may lead to further improvement when the global topology is poorly sampled. We test our proposed method on a set of lattice data, and compare it to traditional methods.",

Results are presented at one value of the lattice spacing, $a=0.12$ fm, and two values of light quarks corresponding to $M_π=310$ and $220$ MeV.

The electric form factor of each octet baryon is extrapolated to the physical pseudoscalar masses, after finite-volume corrections have been applied, at six fixed values of $Q^2$ in the range 0.2-1.3 GeV$^2$. The extrapolated lattice results accurately reproduce the experimental form factors of the nucleon at the physical point, indicating that omitted disconnected quark loop contributions are small. Furthermore, using the results of a recent lattice study of the magnetic form factors, we determine the ratio $μ_p G^p_E/G^p_M$. This quantity decreases with $Q^2$ in a way qualitatively consistent with recent experimental results.",

The calculation is performed within single-channel Lüscher's finite-size formalism. The threshold scattering parameters, namely the scattering length $a_0$ and the effective range $r_0$, for the $s$-wave scattering in $J^P=1^+$ channel are extracted. For the cases in our study, the interaction between the two charmed mesons is weakly repulsive. Our lattice results therefore do not support the possibility of a shallow bound state for the two mesons for the pion mass values we studied. This calculation provides some useful information on the nature of the newly discovered resonance-like structure $Z_c(3900)$ by various experimental groups.",

      "title": "Neutron in a Strong Magnetic Field: Finite Volume Effects",
      "summary": "We investigate the neutron's response to magnetic fields on a torus with the aid of chiral perturbation theory, and expose effects from non-vanishing holonomies. The determination of such effects necessitates non-perturbative treatment of the magnetic field; and, to this end, a strong-field power counting is employed. Using a novel coordinate-space method, we find the neutron propagates in a coordinate-dependent effective potential that we obtain by integrating out charged pions winding around the torus. Knowledge of these finite volume effects will aid in the extraction of neutron properties from lattice QCD computations in external magnetic fields. In particular, we obtain finite volume corrections to the neutron magnetic moment and magnetic polarizability. These quantities have not been computed correctly in the literature. In addition to effects from non-vanishing holonomies, finite volume corrections depend on the magnetic flux quantum through an Aharonov-Bohm effect. We make a number of observations that demonstrate the importance of non-perturbative effects from strong magnetic fields currently employed in lattice QCD calculations. These observations concern neutron physics in both finite and infinite volume.",

We use an improved staggered action for the light valence and sea quarks (the MILC \\asqtad\\ configurations), and the Fermilab action for the heavy quarks. Our calculations incorporate higher statistics, finer lattice spacings, and lighter quark masses than our 2008 work. As a byproduct of tuning the new data set, we obtain the $D_s$ and $B_s$ hyperfine splittings with few-MeV accuracy. For the zero-recoil form factor, we obtain $\\mathcal{F}(1)=0.906(4)(12)$, where the first error is statistical and the second is the sum in quadrature of all systematic errors. With the latest HFAG average of experimental results and a cautious treatment of QED effects, we find $|V_{cb}| = (39.04 \\pm 0.49_\\text{expt} \\pm 0.53_\\text{QCD} \\pm 0.19_\\text{QED})\\times10^{-3}$.

      "summary": "Now that Lattice QCD calculations are beginning to include QED, it is important to better understand how hadronic properties are modified by finite-volume QED effects. They are known to exhibit power-law scaling with volume, in contrast to the exponential behavior of finite-volume strong interaction effects. We use non-relativistic effective field theories describing the low-momentum behavior of hadrons to determine the finite-volume QED corrections to the masses of mesons, baryons and nuclei out to O(1/L^4) in a volume expansion, where L is the spatial extent of the cubic volume. This generalizes the previously determined expansion for mesons, and extends it by two orders in 1/L to include contributions from the charge radius, magnetic moment and polarizabilities of the hadron. We make an observation about direct calculations of the muon g-2 in a finite volume.",

Comparison with the latest LUX results leads to tight bounds on the fraction of the constituent-fermion mass that may arise from electroweak symmetry breaking. Lattice calculations of the dark matter mass spectrum and the Higgs-dark matter coupling are performed on quenched $16^{3} \\times 32$, $32^{3} \\times 64$, $48^{3} \\times 96$, and $64^{3} \\times128$ lattices with three different lattice spacings, using Wilson fermions with moderate to heavy pseudoscalar meson masses.

We apply this framework in a particular BSM context, namely SU(3) gauge theory with N_f=2 massless flavors in the 2-index symmetric (sextet) representation. Our first results are at a single lattice spacing. We find that both the density of near-zero eigenvalues and the renormalization group invariant mode number indicate spontaneous symmetry breaking. Quantitatively, there is a discrepancy between the determination of the fermion condensate in the chiral limit via the eigenvalue spectrum and the determinations from direct measurements of the chiral condensate and the GMOR relation. We comment on possible explanations of this discrepancy and further refinements of this study.",

This calculation uses 2+1 quark flavors, spatial volumes between (4 fm$)^3$ and (11 fm$)^3$ and temperatures between 139 and 196 MeV . Each temperature was calculated using a single lattice spacing corresponding to a temporal Euclidean extent of $N_t=8$. The disconnected chiral susceptibility, $χ_{\\rm disc}$ shows a pronounced peak whose position and height depend sensitively on the quark mass. We find no metastability in the region of the peak and a peak height which does not change when a 5 fm spatial extent is increased to 10 fm. Each result is strong evidence that the QCD ``phase transition'' is not first order but a continuous cross-over for $m_π=135$ MeV. The peak location determines a pseudo-critical temperature $T_c = 155(1)(8)$ MeV. Chiral $SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R$ symmetry is fully restored above 164 MeV, but anomalous $U(1)_A$ symmetry breaking is non-zero above $T_c$ and vanishes as $T$ is increased to 196 MeV.",

This is part of a program geared towards determining these parameters at the physical point. We carry out a high statistics calculation that allows us to: (1) perform an extrapolation of the kaon polarizability to the physical point; we find $α_K =0.269(43)\\times10^{-4}$fm$^{3}$, (2) quantitatively compare our neutron polarizability results with predictions from $χ$PT, and (3) analyze the dependence on both the valence and sea quark masses.

The algorithm operates on the red-black preconditioned Hermitian operator, and directly accelerates conjugate gradients on the normal equations. The coarse grid representation of this matrix is next-to-next-to-next-to-nearest neighbour and multiple algorithmic advances are introduced, which help minimise the overhead of the coarse grid. The treatment of the coarse grids is purely four dimensional, and the bulk of the coarse grid operations are nearest neighbour. The intrinsic cost of most of the coarse grid operations is therefore comparable to those for the Wilson case. We also document the implementation of this algorithm in the BAGEL/Bfm software package and report on the measured performance gains the algorithm brings to simulations at the physical point on IBM BlueGene/Q hardware.",

      "summary": "We investigate some aspects of 2-flavor QCD with $m_u\\not= m_d$ at low-energy, using the leading order chiral perturbation theory including anomaly effects. While nothing special happens at $m_u=0$ for the fixed $m_d\\not=0$, the neutral pion mass becomes zero at two critical values of $m_u$, between which the neutral pion field condenses, leading to a spontaneously CP broken phase, the so-called Dashen phase. We also show that the \"topological susceptibility\" in the ChPT diverges at these two critical points. We briefly discuss a possibility that $m_u=0$ can be defined by the vanishing the \"topological susceptibility. We finally analyze the case of $m_u=m_d=m$ with $θ=π$, which is equivalent to $m_u= - m_d=-m$ with $θ= 0$ by the chiral rotation. In this case, the $η$ condensation occurs at small $m$, violating the CP symmetry spontaneously. Deep in the $η$ condensation phase, three pions become Nambu-Goldstone bosons, but they show unorthodox behavior at small $m$ that $m_π^2 = O(m^2)$, which, however, is shown to be consistent with the chiral Ward-Takahashi identities.",

We are able to obtain the qualitative features of the nucleon sea flavor structure even at this large pion mass: We observe violation of the Gottfried sum rule, indicating $\\overline{d}(x) > \\overline{u}(x)$; the helicity distribution obeys $Δ\\overline{u}(x) > Δ\\overline{d}(x)$, which is consistent with the STAR data at large and small leptonic pseudorapidity.",

Using covariant symmetries, we show that correlation functions can be constructed from inexpensive approximations without introducing any systematic bias in the final result. We introduce a new class of covariant approximation averaging techniques, known as all-mode averaging (AMA), in which the approximation takes account of contributions of all eigenmodes through the inverse of the Dirac operator computed from the conjugate gradient method with a relaxed stopping condition. In this paper we compare the performance and computational cost of our new method with traditional methods using correlation functions and masses of the pion, nucleon, and vector meson in $N_f=2+1$ lattice QCD using domain-wall fermions. This comparison indicates that AMA significantly reduces statistical errors in Monte-Carlo calculations over conventional methods for the same cost.",

Compared to our previous publication, which was based largely on a single ensemble at each of the three lattice spacings $a\\approx 0.09\\;$fm, $0.06\\;$fm and $0.045\\;$fm, we have added seven new fine and four new superfine ensembles, with a range of values of the light and strange sea-quark masses. We have also increased the number of measurements on one of the original ensembles. This allows us to do controlled extrapolations in the light and strange sea-quark masses, which we do simultaneously with the continuum extrapolation. This reduces the extrapolation error and improves the reliability of our error estimates. Our final result is $\\hat{B}_K = 0.7379 \\pm 0.0047 (\\text{stat}) \\pm 0.0365 (\\text{sys})$.",

The highest temperature studied is approximately $1.4 T_c$. Up to this temperature no significant variation of the spectral function is seen in the pseudoscalar channel. The vector channel shows some temperature dependence, which seems to be consistent with a temperature dependent low frequency peak related to heavy quark transport, plus a temperature independent term at ω>0.

Although emphasis is placed in cubic volumes, the result holds for asymmetric volumes. The result is relativistic, holds for all momenta below the three- and four-particle thresholds, and is exact up to exponential volume corrections that are governed by L/r, where L is the spatial extent of the volume and r is the range of the interactions between the particles. For hadronic systems the range of the interaction is set by the inverse of the pion mass, m_pi, and as a result the formalism presented is suitable for m_pi L >> 1. The condition presented is in agreement with all previous studies of two-body systems in a finite volume. Implications of the formalism for the studies of multichannel baryon-baryon systems are discussed.",

The first lattice calculations of the relevant $Λ_b \\to p$ and $Λ_b \\to Λ$ form factors have recently been performed using domain-wall light quarks and static $b$ quarks. To further reduce the theoretical uncertainty, one has to go beyond the static approximation. Here I present new calculations of $Λ_b \\to p$, $Λ_b \\to Λ$, and $Λ_b \\to Λ_c$ form factors using a relativistic heavy-quark action.",

      "summary": "The frequently discussed strongly interacting gauge theory with a fermion flavor doublet in the two-index symmetric (sextet) representation of the SU(3) color gauge group is investigated. In previous studies the chiral condensate and the mass spectrum were shown to be consistent with chiral symmetry breaking ($χ$SB) at vanishing fermion mass. The recently reported $β$-function is not inconsistent with this observation, suggesting that the model is very close to the conformal window and a light \"Higgs impostor\" could emerge as a composite state. In this work we describe the methodology and preliminary results of studying the emergence of the light composite scalar with $0^{++}$ quantum numbers.",

The parton momentum fraction $x$ dependence of this difference has been measured over the region $0.02 < x < 0.35$ from Drell-Yan and semi-inclusive DIS experiments. The Drell-Yan data suggested a possible sign-change for $\\bar d(x)-\\bar u(x)$ near $x \\sim 0.3$, which has not yet been explained by existing theoretical models. We present an independent evidence for the $\\bar d(x)-\\bar u(x)$ sign-change at $x \\sim 0.3$ from an analysis of the DIS data.

The lattice size is fixed at $32^3\\times64$ with a lattice cutoff scale of 1.37(1) GeV. For the calculations with $M_π= 170$ MeV, we employed the All-Mode-Averaging (AMA) technique, which led to roughly a factor of 20 improvement in computational efficiency and has reduced the statistical errors in our results significantly. We were also able to do calculations at two different source-sink separations, at roughly 1.3 fm and 1.0 fm, without much additional cost by reusing the low eigen-modes stored for the AMA calculations. We will present results for the isovector form factors and their derived quantities, including the Dirac and Pauli radii, anomalous magnetic moment and discuss the effects of possible excited-state contaminations. Connected contributions to the isoscalar Dirac and Pauli form factors will also be shown.",

To be useful for future higher precision calculations this relationship must be valid beyond one-loop and very general. We test its validity nonperturbatively using clover and Highly Improved Staggered (HISQ) strange quarks, utilising the absolute normalization of the HISQ temporal axial current. We find that the renormalization of the mixed current differs from the square root of the product of the pure HISQ and pure clover currents by $2-3\\%$. We also compare discretization errors between the clover and HISQ formalisms.",
