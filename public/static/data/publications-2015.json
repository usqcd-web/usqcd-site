The most important application is the anomalous mass dimension in conformal or nearly conformal gauge field theories which might be related to dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking. Some discussion of the underlying theory of renormalization and mixing of operators is also included.",

We describe a family of such manifolds that interpolate between the tangent space at one critical point, where the sign problem is milder compared to the real plane but in some cases still severe, and the union of relevant thimbles, where the sign problem is mild but a multimodal distribution function complicates the Monte Carlo sampling. We exemplify this approach using a simple 0 + 1 dimensional fermion model previously used on sign problem studies and show that it can solve the model for some parameter values where a solution using Lefshetz thimbles was elusive.",

We consider both recent lattice data as well as lowest-order, finite-volume chiral perturbation theory, in order to get a quantitative understanding. Even though leading-order chiral perturbation theory does not provide a good description of the hadronic vacuum polarization, it turns out that it gives a good representation of finite-volume effects. We find that finite-volume effects cannot be ignored when the aim is a few percent level accuracy for the leading-order hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment, even when using ensembles with $m_πL> 4$ and $m_π\\sim 200$ MeV.",

We focus on the relation between the skewness ratio, $S_Bσ_B = χ_3^B/χ_1^B$, and the kurtosis ratio, $κ_Bσ_B^2 =χ_4^B/χ_2^B$. We show that differences in these two cumulant ratios are small for small values of the baryon chemical potential. The next-to-leading order correction to $κ_Bσ_B^2$ however is approximately three times larger than that for $S_Bσ_B$. The former thus drops much more rapidly with increasing beam energy, $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. We argue that these generic patterns are consistent with current data on cumulants of net-proton number fluctuations measured by the STAR Collaboration at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\ge 19.6$~GeV.",

      "title": "Lattice QCD on Non-Orientable Manifolds",
      "summary": "A common problem in lattice QCD simulations on the torus is the extremely long autocorrelation time of the topological charge, when one approaches the continuum limit. The reason is the suppressed tunneling between topological sectors. The problem can be circumvented by replacing the torus with a different manifold, so that the connectivity of the configuration space is changed. This can be achieved by using open boundary conditions on the fields, as proposed earlier. It has the side effect of breaking translational invariance strongly. Here we propose to use a non-orientable manifold, and show how to define and simulate lattice QCD on it. We demonstrate in quenched simulations that this leads to a drastic reduction of the autocorrelation time. A feature of the new proposal is, that translational invariance is preserved up to exponentially small corrections. A Dirac-fermion on a non-orientable manifold poses a challenge to numerical simulations: the fermion determinant becomes complex. We propose two approaches to circumvent this problem.",

      "summary": "We investigate properties of low-energy QCD in a finite spatial volume, but with arbitrary temperature. In the limit of small temperature and small cube size compared to the pion Compton wavelength, Leutwyler has shown that the effective theory describing low-energy QCD reduces to that of quantum mechanics on the coset manifold, which is the so-called delta regime of chiral perturbation theory. We solve this quantum mechanics analytically for the case of a $U(1)_L \\times U(1)_R$ subgroup of chiral symmetry, and numerically for the case of $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$. We utilize the quantum mechanical spectrum to compute the mass gap and chiral condensate, and investigate symmetry restoration in a finite spatial volume as a function of temperature. Because we obtain the spectrum for non-zero values of the quark mass, we are able to interpolate between the rigid rotor limit, which emerges at vanishing quark mass, and the harmonic approximation, which is referred to as the p-regime. We find that the applicability of perturbation theory about the rotor limit largely requires lighter-than-physical quarks. As a stringent check of our results, we raise the temperature to that of the inverse cube size. When this condition is met, the quantum mechanics reduces to a matrix model. The condensate we obtain in this limit agrees with that determined analytically in the epsilon regime.",

      "summary": "In this proceedings we discuss the motivation, implementation details, and performance of a new physics code base called Grid. It is intended to be more performant, more general, but similar in spirit to QDP++\\cite{QDP}. Our approach is to engineer the basic type system to be consistently fast, rather than bolt on a few optimised routines, and we are attempt to write all our optimised routines directly in the Grid framework. It is hoped this will deliver best known practice performance across the next generation of supercomputers, which will provide programming challenges to traditional scalar codes.\n  We illustrate the programming patterns used to implement our goals, and advances in productivity that have been enabled by using new features in C++11.",

We study the behavior of low-lying eigenvalues of the massless improved Wilson-Dirac operator as a function of three-dimensional physical volume, after taking the continuum limit at fixed physical volumes. We find the following evidences against the presence of bilinear condensate: the eigenvalues do not scale as the inverse of the three-dimensional physical volume, and the number variance associated with these eigenvalues do not exhibit ergodic behavior. The inverse participation ratio (IPR) of the associated eigenvectors exhibits a multi-fractal volume scaling. The relation satisfied by number variance and IPR suggests critical behavior.",

In the infrared limit the massive fermions decouple and the massless fermions break chiral symmetry. The running coupling of this system \"walks\" and the energy range of walking can be tuned by the mass of the heavy flavors. Renormalization group considerations predict that the spectrum of such a system shows hyperscaling.\n  We have studied a model with four light and eight heavy flavors coupled to SU(3) gauge fields and verified the above expectations. We determined the mass of several hadronic states and found that some of them are in the 2-3 TeV range if the scale is set by the pseudoscalar decay constant $F_π\\approx 250$ GeV. The $0^{++}$ scalar state behaves very differently from the other hadronic states. In most of our simulations it is nearly degenerate with the pion and we estimate its mass to be less than half of the vector resonance mass.",

All parameterizations are matched to a hadron resonance gas equation of state at T = 155 MeV, at which point the calculations are continued using the UrQMD hadronic cascade. Calculations for $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV Au+Au collisions in three centrality classes are compared to experimental data for final state particle spectra and anisotropic flow coefficients $v_2$ and $v_3$ as well as for pion HBT radii. Experimental observables for the stout and HISQ/tree equations of state are observed to differ by less than a few percent for all observables, while the s95p-v1 equation of state generates spectra and flow coefficients which differ by ~10-20%. Calculations in which the HISQ/tree equation of state is sampled from the published error distribution are also observed to differ by less than a few percent.",

It is constructed by integrating out the gauge field and then using the hopping parameter expansion. The latter is tested with Monte Carlo simulations for small values of the scalar self-coupling. In the opposite limit, at infinitely large self-coupling, the Higgs mode is frozen and the partition function can be written in terms of local tensors and the tensor renormalization group blocking can be applied. The numerical implementation requires truncations and the time continuum limit of the blocked transfer matrix can be obtained numerically. At zero gauge coupling and with a spin-1 truncation, the small volume energy spectrum is identical to the low energy spectrum of a two-species Bose-Hubbard model in the limit of large onsite repulsion. The procedure is extended to finite gauge coupling and we derive a spin-1 approximation of the Hamiltonian which involves terms corresponding to transitions among the two species in the Bose-Hubbard model. An optical lattice implementation involving a ladder structure is proposed.",

      "summary": "As a part of the project studying large $N_f$ QCD, the LatKMI Collaboration has been investigating the SU(3) gauge theory with four fundamental fermions (four-flavor QCD). The main purpose of studying four-flavor QCD is to provide a qualitative comparison to $N_f= 8$, $12$, $16$ QCD; however, a quantitative comparison to real-world QCD is also interesting. To make such comparisons more meaningful, it is desirable to use the same kind of lattice action consistently, so that qualitative difference of different theories are less affected by artifacts of lattice discretization. Here, we adopt the highly-improved staggered quark action with the tree-level Symanzik gauge action (HISQ/tree), which is exactly the same as the setup for our simulations for $SU(3)$ gauge theories with $N_f=8$, $12$ and $16$ fundamental fermions~\\cite{Aoki:2013xza, Aoki:2012eq, Aoki:2014oma}. In the next section, we show the fermion mass dependence of $F_π$, $\\langle\\barψψ\\rangle$, $M_π$, $M_ρ$, $M_N$ and their chiral extrapolations. In section 3, preliminary results of the measurement of the mass of the flavor-singlet scalar bound state will be reported.",

The neutron and proton EDM form factors are extracted from three-point functions at the next-to-leading order in the $θ$ vacuum of QCD. In this computation, we use pion masses 0.33 and 0.42 GeV and 2.7 fm$^3$ lattices with Iwasaki gauge action and a 0.17 GeV pion and 4.6 fm$^3$ lattice with I-DSDR gauge action, all generated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations. The all-mode-averaging technique enables an efficient and high statistics calculation. Chiral behavior of lattice EDM's is discussed in the context of baryon chiral perturbation theory. In addition, we also show numerical evidence on relationship of three- and two-point correlation function with local topological distribution.",

The fermion 2-point functions obey a closed set of differential equations, which can be solved with linear algebra methods. The staggered occupation order parameter of the t-V model decreases exponentially during the dissipative time evolution. The structure factor associated with the various Fourier modes shows the slowing down of low-momentum modes, which is due to particle number conservation. The processes with nearest-neighbor-dependent Lindblad operators have a decay rate that is proportional to the coordination number of the spatial lattice.",

Here I focus on the gradient flow as a means to suppress power-divergent mixing. Power-divergent mixing stems from the hypercubic symmetry of the lattice regulator and is a particular difficulty for calculations of, for example, high moments of parton distribution functions. The gradient flow removes power-divergent mixing on the lattice, provided the flow time is kept fixed in physical units, at the expense of introducing a new physical scale in the continuum. One approach to dealing with this new scale is the smeared operator product expansion, a formalism that systematically connects nonperturbative calculations of flowed operators to continuum physics. I study the role of the gradient flow in suppressing power-divergent mixing and present the first nonperturbative study in scalar field theory.",

The resulting scenario is built around new evidence substantiating the existence of a phase characterized by bimodal (anomalous) density, and corresponding to deconfined dynamics with broken valence chiral symmetry. We argue that such anomalous phase occurs quite generically in these theories, including in \"real world\" QCD above the crossover temperature, and in zero-temperature systems with many light flavors.",

The mass and width of the rho resonance is extracted by fitting these phaseshifts. To vary the scattering momentum we employ asymmetric boxes. We use $N_f = 2$ nHYP-smeared clover fermions and generate two sets of ensembles with pion masses about 315MeV and 227MeV. To determine the phase shifts we compute the energy spectrum both for states at rest and boosted.

Hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) and hadronic light by light (HLbL) are the two types of processes that contribute most to the theoretical uncertainty. The current value for HLbL is still given by models. I will describe results from a first-principles lattice calculation with a 139 MeV pion in a box of 5.5 fm extent. Our current numerical strategies, including noise reduction techniques, evaluating the HLbL amplitude at zero external momentum transfer, and important remaining challenges, in particular those associated with finite volume effects, will be discussed.",

We do so by evaluating the $CP$-odd form factor $F_3$ for small values of the $CP$-violation parameter $θ$ in the limit of zero momentum transfer. This limit is extracted using the usual parametrization but in addition position space methods. The topological charge is computed via cooling and gradient flow using the Wilson, Symanzik tree-level improved and Iwasaki actions for smoothing. We obtain consistent results for all choices of smoothing procedures and methods to extract $F_3$ at zero momentum transfer.

This alternative renormalization procedure allows for the renormalization over a large temperature range from $T$=100 MeV - 800 MeV, with small errors not only for the fundamental, but also for the higher representations of the Polyakov loop. We discuss the results of this procedure and Casimir scaling of the Polyakov loop.",

Their mass levels are ordered as $M_{3/2^+}<M_{3/2^-}\\approx M_{1/2^-}<M_{1/2^+}$, as is expected from the constituent quark model. The mass values are also close to those of the four $Ω$ states observed in experiments, respectively. We calculate the Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes of $Ω(3/2^+)$ and $Ω(1/2^+)$ and find there is a radial node for the $Ω(1/2^+)$ Bethe-Salpeter amplitude, which may imply that $Ω(1/2^+)$ is an orbital excitation of $Ω$ baryons as a member of the $(D,L_N^P)=(70,0_2^+)$ supermultiplet in the $SU(6)\\bigotimes O(3)$ quark model description.

      "summary": "We present a calculation of the $D\\to K \\ell ν$ and $D\\toπ\\ell ν$ semileptonic form factors at $q^2=0$, which enable determinations of the CKM matrix elements $\\lvert{V_{cs}}\\rvert$ and $\\lvert{V_{cd}}\\rvert$, respectively. We use gauge-field configurations generated by the MILC collaboration with four flavors of highly-improved staggered (HISQ) quarks, analyzing several ensembles including those with physical pion masses and approximate lattice spacings ranging from 0.12~fm to 0.042~fm. We also use the HISQ action for the valence quarks. We employ twisted boundary conditions to calculate the form factors at zero momentum transfer directly. We use heavy-light-meson chiral perturbation theory modified for energetic pions and kaons, and supplemented by terms to describe the lattice-spacing dependence, to obtain preliminary results at the physical point and in the continuum limit.",

      "summary": "We present a calculation of the strange and charm quark contributions to the nucleon spin from the anomalous Ward identity (AWI). It is performed with overlap valence quarks on 2+1-flavor domain-wall fermion gauge configurations on a $24^3 \\times 64$ lattice with the light sea mass at $m_π = 330$ MeV. To satisfy the AWI, the overlap fermion for the pseudoscalar density and the overlap Dirac operator for the topological density, which do not have multiplicative renormalization, are used to normalize the form factor of the local axial-vector current at finite $q^2$. For the charm quark, we find that the negative pseudoscalar term almost cancels the positive topological term. For the strange quark, the pseudoscalar term is less negative than that of the charm. By imposing the AWI, the strange $g_A(q^2)$ at $q^2 =0$ is obtained by a global fit of the pseudoscalar and the topological form factors, together with $g_A(q^2)$ and the induced pseudoscalar form factor $h_A(q^2)$ at finite $q^2$. The chiral extrapolation to the physical pion mass gives $Δs + Δ{\\bar{s}} = -0.0403(44)(78)$.",

The transition amplitude is related to the coupling constant and via the Fermi's Golden Rule to the decay width.

From a set of calculations at four volumes, corresponding to spatial sizes of 2, 2.5, 3, and 4 fm, and a pion mass of m_pi ~ 390 MeV, we determine the scattering lengths and effective ranges for these systems at the corresponding quark masses.

      "summary": "The electroweak interaction at the level of quarks and gluons are well understood from precision measurements in high energy collider experiments. Relating these fundamental parameters to Hadronic Parity Violation in nuclei however remains an outstanding theoretical challenge. One of the most interesting observables in this respect is the parity violating hadronic neutral current: it is hard to measure in collider experiments and is thus the least constrained observable of the Standard Model. Precision measurements of parity violating transitions in nuclei can help to improve these constraints. In these systems however, the weak interaction is masked by effects of the seven orders of magnitude stronger non-perturbative strong interaction. Therefore, in order to relate experimental measurements of the parity violating pion-nucleon couplings to the fundamental Lagrangian of the SM, these non-perturbative effects have to be well understood. In this paper, we are going to present a Lattice QCD approach for computing the $ΔI{=}2$ parity violating matrix element in proton proton scattering. This process does not involve disconnected diagrams in the isospin symmetric limit and is thus a perfect testbed for studying the feasibility of the more involved calculation of the parity violating pion-nucleon coupling.",

Finally, we present preliminary results for the $B_c \\rightarrow η_c \\ell ν$ semileptonic decay form factors. This is a showcase for the comparison of results for NRQCD $b$ quarks with those from HISQ $b$ quarks (both with HISQ $c$ quarks).

      "summary": "For reliable comparison of the standard model prediction to the muon g-2 with its experimental value, the hadronic light-by-light scattering (HLbL) contribution must be calculated by lattice QCD simulation. HLbL contribution has many types of disconnected-type diagrams. Here, we start with recalling the point that must be taken care of in every method to calculate them by lattice QCD, and present one concrete method called nonperturbative QED method.",

We use the FLAG and SWME results for $\\hat{B}_K$. We use the RBC-UKQCD result for $ξ_0$ determined using the experimental value of $\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon$ and the lattice result of $\\mathrm{Im}\\,A_2$. To set the Wolfenstein parameter $λ$, we use $|V_{us}|$, which is determined from $K_{\\ell3}$ and $K_{\\mu2}$ decays combined with lattice evaluations of the $K \\to π\\ell ν$ vector form factor and $f_K$. To set the Wolfenstein parameter $A$, we use the FNAL/MILC results for $|V_{cb}|$, which are determined from the exclusive decay $\\bar{B} \\to D^* \\ell \\barν$ and the axial form factor at zero recoil. We also use the inclusive $|V_{cb}|$ obtained using the heavy quark expansion based on QCD sum rules and the OPE. We compare the results with those for exclusive $|V_{cb}|$. We find that the standard model prediction of $\\varepsilon_K$ with exclusive $|V_{cb}|$ (lattice QCD results) is lower than the experimental value by 3.4$σ$. However, we observe no tension in $\\varepsilon_K$ determined from inclusive $|V_{cb}|$.",

      "summary": "We study the correlators of Polyakov loops, and the corresponding gauge invariant free energy of a static quark-antiquark pair in 2+1 flavor QCD at finite temperature. Our simulations were carried out on $N_t$ = 6, 8, 10, 12, 16 lattices using a Symanzik improved gauge action and a stout improved staggered action with physical quark masses. The free energies calculated from the Polyakov loop correlators are extrapolated to the continuum limit. For the free energies we use a two step renormalization procedure that only uses data at finite temperature. We also measure correlators with definite Euclidean time reversal and charge conjugation symmetry to extract two different screening masses, one in the magnetic, and one in the electric sector, to distinguish two different correlation lengths in the full Polyakov loop correlator.

      "summary": "When several four-quark operators are allowed to mix through renormalisation, this can considerably amplify the problems coming from perturbative truncation and discretisation effects. In this work we investigate whether our previous $B_K$ strategy can conveniently be generalised to a wider set of operators, corresponding to the so-called \"SUSY $B_K$\" basis of four-quark operators. We show that the discretisation effects, when plotted as a function of $ap$, are surprisingly independent of the lattice spacing. They appear reasonably under control up to very large energy scales. This allows us to discuss the effect of varying the intermediate scale on which the perturbative matching is done, and therefore the prospects of future high-precision studies with a Rome-Southampton renormalisation.",

Quark masses are extracted from the scalar part of quark propagators in the Landau gauge. Scalar diquark quark mass difference and axial vector scalar diquark mass difference are obtained for diquarks composed of two light quarks and of a strange and a light quark. Light sea quark mass dependence of the results is examined. Two lattice spacings are used to check the discretization effects. The coarse and fine lattices are of sizes $24^3\\times64$ and $32^3\\times64$ with inverse spacings $1/a=1.75(4) {\\rm~GeV}$ and $2.33(5) {\\rm~GeV}$, respectively.",

      "summary": "QCD at non-zero chemical potential ($μ$) for quark number has a complex fermion determinant and thus standard simulation methods for lattice QCD cannot be applied. We therefore simulate this theory using the Complex-Langevin algorithm with Gauge Cooling in addition to adaptive methods, to prevent runaway behaviour. Simulations are performed at zero temperature on a $12^4$ lattice with 2 quarks which are light enough that $m_N/3$ is significantly larger than $m_π/2$. Preliminary results are qualitatively as expected. The quark-number density is close to zero for $μ< m_N/3$, beyond which it increases, eventually reaching its saturation value of $3$ for $μ$ sufficiently large. The chiral condensate decreases as $μ$ is increased approaching zero at saturation, while the plaquette increases towards its quenched value. We have yet to observe the transition to nuclear matter at $μ\\approx m_N/3$, presumably because the runs for $μ$ between $m_N/3$ and saturation have yet to equilibrate.",

The gauge configurations analyzed are produced by the European Twisted Mass Collaboration using $N_f{=}2{+}1{+}1$ twisted mass fermions at one value of the lattice spacing of $a \\simeq 0.082 \\ {\\rm fm}$ and a light quark mass corresponding to $m_π \\simeq 373 \\ {\\rm MeV}$. Our approach to extract the neutron electric dipole moment is based on the calculation of the $CP$-odd electromagnetic form factor $F_3(Q^2)$ for small values of the vacuum angle $θ$ in the limit of zero Euclidean momentum transfer $Q^2$. The limit $Q^2 \\to 0$ is realized either by adopting a parameterization of the momentum dependence of $F_3(Q^2)$ and performing a fit, or by employing new position space methods, which involve the elimination of the kinematical momentum factor in front of $F_3(Q^2)$. The computation in the presence of a $CP$-violating term requires the evaluation of the topological charge ${\\cal Q}$. This is computed by applying the cooling technique and the gradient flow with three different actions, namely the Wilson, the Symanzik tree-level improved and the Iwasaki action. We demonstrate that cooling and gradient flow give equivalent results for the neutron electric dipole moment. Our analysis yields a value of $\\vert \\vec{d}_N\\vert=0.045(6)(1)\\ \\barθ \\ e \\cdot {\\rm fm}$ for the ensemble with $m_π=373$ MeV considered.",

Indications are that finite-volume effects cannot be ignored when the aim is a few percent level accuracy for the hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment, even when $m_πL \\sim 4$ and $m_π\\sim 200$ MeV.",

      "summary": "The dynamical origin of electroweak symmetry breaking is an open question with many possible theoretical explanations. Strongly coupled systems predicting the Higgs boson as a bound state of a new gauge-fermion interaction form one class of candidate models. Due to increased statistics, LHC run II will further constrain the phenomenologically viable models in the near future. In the meanwhile it is important to understand the general properties and specific features of the different competing models.\n  In this work we discuss many-flavor gauge-fermion systems that contain both massless (light) and massive fermions. The former provide Goldstone bosons and trigger electroweak symmetry breaking, while the latter indirectly influence the infrared dynamics. Numerical results reveal that such systems can exhibit a light $0^{++}$ isosinglet scalar, well separated from the rest of the spectrum. Further, when we set the scale via the $vev$ of electroweak symmetry breaking, we predict a 2 TeV vector resonance which could be a generic feature of SU(3) gauge theories.",

The model is similar to that considered in a recent paper by Ayyer and Chandrasekharan \\cite{Ayyar:2014eua}.

      "summary": "The magnitude of the $U_A(1)$ symmetry breaking is expected to affect the nature of $N_f=2$ QCD chiral phase transition. The explicit breaking of chiral symmetry due to realistic light quark mass is small, so it is important to use chiral fermions on the lattice to understand the effect of $U_A(1)$ near the chiral crossover temperature, $T_c$. We report our latest results for the eigenvalue spectrum of 2+1 flavour QCD with dynamical Mobius domain wall fermions at finite temperature probed using the overlap operator on $32^3\\times 8$ lattice. We check how sensitive the low-lying eigenvalues are to the sea-light quark mass. We also present a comparison with the earlier independent results with domain wall fermions.",

We investigate this approach for a simple fermionic model. We introduce an easy to implement Monte Carlo algorithm to sample the dominant thimble. Our algorithm relies only on the integration of the gradient flow in the numerically stable direction, which gives it a distinct advantage over the other proposed algorithms. We demonstrate the stability and efficiency of the algorithm by applying it to an exactly solvable fermionic model and compare our results with the analytical ones. We report a very good agreement for a certain region in the parameter space where the dominant contribution comes from a single thimble, including a region where standard methods suffer from a severe sign problem. However, we find that there are also regions in the parameter space where the contribution from multiple thimbles is important, even in the continuum limit.",

      "summary": "Lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) studies of electromagnetic properties of hadrons and light nuclei, such as magnetic moments and polarizabilities, have proven successful with the use of background field methods. With an implementation of nonuniform background electromagnetic fields, properties such as charge radii and higher electromagnetic multipole moments (for states of higher spin) can be additionally obtained. This can be achieved by matching lattice QCD calculations to a corresponding low-energy effective theory that describes the static and quasi-static response of hadrons and nuclei to weak external fields. With particular interest in the case of vector mesons and spin-1 nuclei such as the deuteron, we present an effective field theory of spin-1 particles coupled to external electromagnetic fields. To constrain the charge radius and the electric quadrupole moment of the composite spin-1 field, the single-particle Green's functions in a linearly varying electric field in space are obtained within the effective theory, providing explicit expressions that can be used to match directly onto lattice QCD correlation functions. The viability of an extraction of the charge radius and the electric quadrupole moment of the deuteron from the upcoming lattice QCD calculations of this nucleus is discussed.",

These processes provide theoretically clean windows into physics beyond the Standard Model because the hadronic uncertainties are now under good control for suitably binned observables. For example, the resulting partially integrated branching fractions for $B\\toπμ^+μ^-$ and $B\\to Kμ^+μ^-$ outside the charmonium resonance region are 1-2$σ$ higher than the LHCb Collaboration's recent measurements, where the theoretical and experimental errors are commensurate. The combined tension is 1.7$σ$. Combining the Standard-Model rates with LHCb's measurements yields values for the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements $|V_{td}|=7.45{(69)}\\times10^{-3}$, $|V_{ts}|=35.7(1.5)\\times10^{-3}$, and $|V_{td}/V_{ts}|=0.201{(20)}$, which are compatible with the values obtained from neutral $B_{(s)}$-meson oscillations and have competitive uncertainties. Alternatively, taking the CKM matrix elements from unitarity, we constrain new-physics contributions at the electroweak scale. The constraints on the Wilson coefficients ${\\rm Re}(C_9)$ and ${\\rm Re}(C_{10})$ from $B\\toπμ^+μ^-$ and $B\\to Kμ^+μ^-$ are competitive with those from $B\\to K^* μ^+μ^-$, and display a 2.0$σ$ tension with the Standard Model. Our predictions for $B\\to K(π)ν\\barν$ and $B\\toπτν$ are close to the current experimental limits.",

While the analytic techniques of quantum field theory have played a key role in understanding the dynamics of matter in high energy processes, they encounter difficulties when applied to low-energy nuclear structure and reactions, and dense systems. Expected increases in computational resources into the exascale during the next decade will provide the ability to determine a range of important strong interaction processes directly from QCD using the numerical technique of Lattice QCD. This will complement the nuclear physics experimental program, and in partnership with new thrusts in nuclear many-body theory, will enable unprecedented understanding and refinement of nuclear forces and, more generally, the visible matter in our universe. In this presentation, I will discuss the state-of-the-art Lattice QCD calculations of quantities of interest in nuclear physics, progress that is expected in the near future, and the anticipated impact.",

Specifically, we present a relativistic, model-independent relation between finite-volume matrix elements of external currents and the physically observable infinite-volume matrix elements involving two-particle asymptotic states. The result presented holds for states composed of two scalar bosons. These can be identical or non-identical and, in the latter case, can be either degenerate or non-degenerate. We further accommodate any number of strongly-coupled two-scalar channels. This formalism will, for example, allow future lattice QCD calculations of the $ρ$-meson form factor, in which the unstable nature of the $ρ$ is rigorously accommodated.",

The calculation is performed in relativistic quantum field theory with particles coupled via a $λφ^4$ interaction, and we work through order $λ^3$. The energy shifts begin at ${\\cal O}(1/L^3)$, and we keep subleading terms proportional to $1/L^4$, $1/L^5$ and $1/L^6$. These terms allow a non-trivial check of the results obtained from quantization conditions that hold for arbitrary interactions, namely that of Lüscher for two particles and our recently developed formalism for three particles. We also compare to previously obtained results based on non-relativistic quantum mechanics.",

Using 2+1 flavor QCD with highly improved staggered quarks and lattices with temporal extents of $N_τ=6$, $8$, $10$ and $12$ we calculate the renormalized Polyakov loop in many representations including fundamental, sextet, adjoint, decuplet, 15-plet, 24-plet and 27-plet. This approach allows for the calculations of the renormalized Polyakov loops over a large temperature range from $T=116$ MeV up to $T=815$ MeV, with small errors not only for the Polyakov loop in fundamental representation, but also for the Polyakov loops in higher representations. We compare our results with standard renormalization schemes and discuss the Casimir scaling of the Polyakov loops.",

      "summary": "One of the most important developments in condensed matter physics in recent years has been the discovery and characterization of graphene. A two-dimensional layer of Carbon arranged in a hexagonal lattice, graphene exhibits many interesting electronic properties, most notably that the low energy excitations behave as massless Dirac fermions. These excitations interact strongly via the Coulomb interaction and thus non-perturbative methods are necessary. Using methods borrowed from lattice QCD, we study the graphene effective theory in the presence of an external magnetic field. Graphene, along with other $(2+1)$-dimensional field theories, has been predicted to undergo spontaneous breaking of flavor symmetry including the formation of a gap as a result of the external magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as magnetic catalysis. Our study investigates magnetic catalysis using a fully non-perturbative approach.",

The ensembles span lattice spacings from 0.12 to 0.045 fm and have multiple sea-quark masses to help control the chiral extrapolation. The asqtad improved staggered action is used for the light valence and sea quarks, and the clover action with the Fermilab interpretation is used for the heavy $b$ quark. We present results for the form factors $f_+(q^2)$, $f_0(q^2)$, and $f_T(q^2)$, where $q^2$ is the momentum transfer, together with a comprehensive examination of systematic errors. Lattice QCD determines the form factors for a limited range of $q^2$, and we use the model-independent $z$ expansion to cover the whole kinematically allowed range. We present our final form-factor results as coefficients of the $z$ expansion and the correlations between them, where the errors on the coefficients include statistical and all systematic uncertainties. We use this complete description of the form factors to test QCD predictions of the form factors at high and low $q^2$. We also compare a Standard-Model calculation of the branching ratio for $B \\to Kl^+l^-$ with experimental data.",

      "title": "Leptonic Decays of Charged Pseudoscalar Mesons - 2015",
      "summary": "We review the physics of purely leptonic decays of $π^\\pm$, $K^\\pm$, $D^{\\pm}$, $D_s^\\pm$, and $B^\\pm$ pseudoscalar mesons. The measured decay rates are related to the product of the relevant weak-interaction-based CKM matrix element of the constituent quarks and a strong interaction parameter related to the overlap of the quark and antiquark wave-functions in the meson, called the decay constant $f_P$. The leptonic decay constants for $π^\\pm$, $K^\\pm$, $D^{\\pm}$, $D_s^\\pm$, and $B^\\pm$ mesons can be obtained with controlled theoretical uncertainties and high precision from {\\it ab initio} lattice-QCD simulations. The combination of experimental leptonic decay-rate measurements and theoretical decay-constant calculations enables the determination of several elements of the CKM matrix within the standard model. These determinations are competitive with those obtained from semileptonic decays, and also complementary because they are sensitive to different quark flavor-changing currents. They can also be used to test the unitarity of the first and second rows of the CKM matrix. Conversely, taking the CKM elements predicted by unitarity, one can infer \"experimental\" values for $f_P$ that can be compared with theory. These provide tests of lattice-QCD methods, provided new-physics contributions to leptonic decays are negligible at the current level of precision. This review is the basis of the article in the Particle Data Group's 2016 edition, updating the versions in Refs. [1-3].",

      "title": "Kaon BSM B-parameters using improved staggered fermions from $N_f=2+1$ unquenched QCD",
      "summary": "We present results for the matrix elements of the additional $ΔS=2$ operators that appear in models of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), expressed in terms of four BSM $B$-parameters. Combined with experimental results for $ΔM_K$ and $ε_K$, these constrain the parameters of BSM models. We use improved staggered fermions, with valence HYP-smeared quarks and $N_f=2+1$ flavors of \"asqtad\" sea quarks. The configurations have been generated by the MILC collaboration. The matching between lattice and continuum four-fermion operators and bilinears is done perturbatively at one-loop order. We use three lattice spacings for the continuum extrapolation: $a\\approx 0.09$, $0.06$ and $0.045\\;$fm. Valence light-quark masses range down to $\\approx m_s^{\\rm phys}/13$ while the light sea-quark masses range down to $\\approx m_s^{\\rm phys}/20$. Compared to our previous published work, we have added four additional lattice ensembles, leading to better controlled extrapolations in the lattice spacing and sea-quark masses. We report final results for two renormalization scales, $μ=2\\;\\text{GeV}$ and $3\\;\\text{GeV}$, and compare them to those obtained by other collaborations. Agreement is found for two of the four BSM $B$-parameters ($B_2$ and $B_3^\\text{SUSY}$). The other two ($B_4$ and $B_5$) differ significantly from those obtained using RI-MOM renormalization as an intermediate scheme, but are in agreement with recent preliminary results obtained by the RBC-UKQCD collaboration using RI-SMOM intermediate schemes.",

For the fermion part of the action we employ the twisted mass formulation with $N_f{=}2$ and $N_f{=}4$ degenerate dynamical quarks, while in the gluon sector we use the Iwasaki improved action. The simulations for $N_f{=}4$ have been performed for pion masses in the range of 390MeV - 760MeV and at three values of the lattice spacing, $a$, corresponding to $β{=}1.90,\\,1.95,\\,2.10$. The $N_f{=}2$ action includes a clover term with $c_{\\rm sw}{=}1.57551$ at $β{=}2.10$, and three ensembles at different values of $m_π$.\n  The evaluation of the renormalization functions is carried out in the RI$'$ scheme using a momentum source. The non-perturbartive evaluation is complemented with a perturbative computation, which is carried out at one-loop level and to all orders in the lattice spacing, $a$. For each renormalization function computed non-perturbatively we subtract the corresponding lattice artifacts to all orders in $a$, so that a large part of the cut-off effects is eliminated.\n  The renormalization functions are converted to the ${\\overline{\\rm MS}}$ scheme at a reference energy scale of $μ{=}2$ GeV after taking the chiral limit.",

The 4th order cumulant $c_4$ of topological charge, as well as the ratio $c_4/χ_t$ are also investigated. Results of $c_4$ show step-like behavior near $T_c$ while the ratio at high temperature agrees with the value as predicted by the diluted instanton gas model.",

      "title": "Two Nucleon Systems at $m_π\\sim 450~{\\rm MeV}$ from Lattice QCD",
      "summary": "Nucleon-nucleon systems are studied with lattice quantum chromodynamics at a pion mass of $m_π\\sim 450~{\\rm MeV}$ in three spatial volumes using $n_f=2+1$ flavors of light quarks. At the quark masses employed in this work, the deuteron binding energy is calculated to be $B_d = 14.4^{+3.2}_{-2.6} ~{\\rm MeV}$, while the dineutron is bound by $B_{nn} = 12.5^{+3.0}_{-5.0}~{\\rm MeV}$. Over the range of energies that are studied, the S-wave scattering phase shifts calculated in the 1S0 and 3S1-3D1 channels are found to be similar to those in nature, and indicate repulsive short-range components of the interactions, consistent with phenomenological nucleon-nucleon interactions. In both channels, the phase shifts are determined at three energies that lie within the radius of convergence of the effective range expansion, allowing for constraints to be placed on the inverse scattering lengths and effective ranges. The extracted phase shifts allow for matching to nuclear effective field theories, from which low energy counterterms are extracted and issues of convergence are investigated. As part of the analysis, a detailed investigation of the single hadron sector is performed, enabling a precise determination of the violation of the Gell-Mann--Okubo mass relation. [An Erratum to the published version is included as an appendix. It details the impact of an error discovered in 2020 and corrects typographical errors.]",

      "summary": "In this article we describe our studies of the sigma meson, f_0(500), using two-pion correlation functions. We use lattice quantum chromodynamics in the quenched approximation with so-called clover fermions. By working at unphysical pion masses we are able to identify a would-be resonance with mass less than $2 m_π$, and then extrapolate to the physical point. We include the most important annihilation diagram, which is \"partially disconnnected\" or \"single annihilation.\" Because this diagram is quite expensive to compute, we introduce a somewhat novel technique for the computation of all-to-all diagrams, based on momentum sources and a truncation in momentum space. In practice, we use only ${\\bf p}=0$ modes, so the method reduces to wall sources. At the point where the mass of the pion takes its physical value, we find a resonance in the $0^{++}$ two-pion channel with a mass of approximately $609 \\pm 80$ MeV, consistent with the expected properties of the sigma meson, given the approximations we are making.",

      "title": "Finite Volume Corrections to the Electromagnetic Mass of Composite Particles",
      "summary": "The long-range electromagnetic interaction presents a challenge for numerical computations in QCD + QED. In addition to power-law finite volume effects, the standard lattice gauge theory approach introduces non-locality through removal of photon zero-momentum modes. The resulting finite volume effects must be quantitatively understood; and, to this end, non-relativistic effective field theories are an efficient tool, especially in the case of composite particles. Recently an oddity related to non-locality of the standard lattice approach was uncovered by the Budapest-Marseille-Wuppertal collaboration. Explicit contributions from antiparticles appear to be required so that finite volume QED results for a point-like fermion can be reproduced in the effective field theory description. We provide transparency for this argument by considering point-like scalars and spinors in finite volume QED using the method of regions. For the more germane case of composite particles, we determine that antiparticle modes contribute to the finite-volume electromagnetic mass of composite spinors through terms proportional to the squares of time-like form factors evaluated at threshold. We extend existing finite volume calculations to one order higher, which is particularly relevant for the electromagnetic mass of light nuclei. Additionally, we verify that the analogous finite volume contributions to the nucleon mass in chiral perturbation theory vanish in accordance with locality.",

      "title": "Effects of kinematic cuts on net-electric charge fluctuations",
      "summary": "The effects of kinematic cuts on electric charge fluctuations in a gas of charged particles are discussed. We consider a very transparent example of an ideal pion gas with quantum statistics, which can be viewed as a multi-component gas of Boltzmann particles with different charges and masses. Cumulants of net-electric charge fluctuations $χ_n^Q$ are calculated in a static and expanding medium with flow parameters adjusted to the experimental data. We show that the transverse momentum cut, $p_{t_\\text{min}}\\leq p_t\\leq p_{t_\\text{max}}$, weakens the effects of Bose statistics, i.e. contributions of effectively multi-charged states to higher order moments. Consequently, cuts in $p_t$ modify the experimentally measured cumulants and their ratios. We discuss the influence of kinematic cuts on the ratio of mean and variance of electric charge fluctuations in a hadron resonance gas, in the light of recent data of the STAR and PHENIX Collaborations. We find that the different momentum cuts of $p_{t_\\text{min}}=0.2$~GeV (STAR) and $p_{t_\\text{min}}=0.3$~GeV (PHENIX) are responsible for more than 30\\% of the difference between these two data sets. We argue that the $p_t$ cuts imposed on charged particles will influence the normalized kurtosis {$κ_Qσ_Q^2 = χ_4^Q/χ_2^Q$} of the electric charge fluctuations. In particular, the reduction of $κ_Qσ_Q^2$ with increasing $p_{t_\\text{min}}$ will lead to differences between PHENIX and STAR data of ${\\cal O}(6\\%)$ which currently are buried under large statistical and systematic errors. We furthermore introduce the relation between momentum cut-off and finite volume effects, which is of relevance for the comparison between experimental data and lattice QCD calculations.",

Therefore precise theoretical predictions and precise experimental measurements have become mandatory. Here we draw attention to the significant advances that have been made on the lattice in recent years in $K\\to ππ$, $ΔM_K$, the long-distance part of $\\varepsilon$ and rare K-decays. Thus, in conjunction with experiments, the construction of a unitarity triangle purely from Kaon physics should soon become feasible.

      "summary": "We present a determination of nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts for l >= 0. The S, P, D and F phase shifts for both the spin-triplet and spin-singlet channels are computed with lattice Quantum ChromoDynamics. For l > 0, this is the first lattice QCD calculation using the Luscher finite-volume formalism. This required the design and implementation of novel lattice methods involving displaced sources and momentum-space cubic sinks. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, the calculations were performed in the SU(3)-flavor limit where the light quark masses have been tuned to the physical strange quark mass, corresponding to m_pi = m_K ~ 800 MeV. In this work, we have assumed that only the lowest partial waves contribute to each channel, ignoring the unphysical partial wave mixing that arises within the finite-volume formalism. This assumption is only valid for sufficiently low energies; we present evidence that it holds for our study using two different channels. Two spatial volumes of V ~ (3.5 fm)^3 and V ~ (4.6 fm)^3 were used. The finite-volume spectrum is extracted from the exponential falloff of the correlation functions. Said spectrum is mapped onto the infinite volume phase shifts using the generalization of the Luscher formalism for two-nucleon systems.",

For baryons, the signal-to-noise problem often restricts one to time separations that are not ideally long, and for which couplings to excited states can obstruct the isolation of ground-state baryon properties. We consider excited-state contamination in nucleon two- and three-point functions. Using chiral perturbation theory, we determine couplings to pion-nucleon and pion-delta excited states. In two-point functions, these contributions are small, in accordance with general properties of the spectral weights on a torus. For the axial-current correlation function in the nucleon, the sign of excited-state contributions suggests overestimation of the nucleon axial charge. Thus contamination from pion-nucleon excited states will not likely explain the trend in lattice QCD data.",

Removing these by extrapolation requires costly computations at multiple volumes. We introduce a photon mass to alternatively regulate the infrared, and rely on effective field theory to remove its unphysical effects. Electromagnetic modifications to the hadron spectrum are reliably estimated with a precision and cost comparable to conventional approaches that utilize multiple larger volumes. A significant overall cost advantage emerges when accounting for ensemble generation. The proposed method may benefit lattice calculations involving multiple charged hadrons, as well as quantum many-body computations with long-range Coulomb interactions.",

      "summary": "We investigate the discrete $β$ function of the 2-flavor SU(3) sextet model using the finite volume gradient flow scheme. Our results, using clover improved nHYP smeared Wilson fermions, follow the (non-universal) 4-loop $\\overline{\\textrm{MS}}$ perturbative predictions closely up to $g^2 \\approx 5.5$, the strongest coupling reached in our simulation. At strong couplings the results are in tension with a recently published work using the same gradient flow renormalization scheme with staggered fermions. Since these calculations define the discrete $β$ function in the same continuum renormalization scheme, they should lead to the same continuum predictions, irrespective of the lattice fermion action.\n  In order to test systematic effects in our computation we compare two different lattice operators, three different flow definitions, and two volume extrapolations. We find agreement among these different approaches in the continuum limit when the gradient flow parameter $c\\gtrsim0.35$. Considering the potential phenomenological impact of this model, it is important to understand the origin of the disagreement between our work and the staggered fermion results.",

The finite volume spectra are described using extensions of Lüscher's method to determine the infinite volume Unitarized Chiral Perturbation Theory scattering amplitude. We exploit the pion mass dependence of this effective theory to obtain the scattering amplitude at $m_π= 140$ MeV. The scattering phase shift is found to be in good agreement with experiment up to center of mass energies of 1.2 GeV. The analytic continuation of the scattering amplitude to the complex plane yields a $ρ$-resonance pole at $E_ρ= \\left[755(2)(1)(^{20}_{02})-\\frac{i}{2}\\,129(3)(1)(^{7}_{1})\\right]~{\\rm MeV}$.

      "summary": "We present physics results from simulations of QCD using $N_f = 2$ dynamical Wilson twisted mass fermions at the physical value of the pion mass. These simulations were enabled by the addition of the clover term to the twisted mass quark action. We show evidence that compared to previous simulations without this term, the pion mass splitting due to isospin breaking is almost completely eliminated. Using this new action, we compute the masses and decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons involving the dynamical up and down as well as valence strange and charm quarks at one value of the lattice spacing, $a \\approx 0.09$ fm. Further, we determine renormalized quark masses as well as their scale-independent ratios, in excellent agreement with other lattice determinations in the continuum limit. In the baryon sector, we show that the nucleon mass is compatible with its physical value and that the masses of the $Δ$ baryons do not show any sign of isospin breaking. Finally, we compute the electron, muon and tau lepton anomalous magnetic moments and show the results to be consistent with extrapolations of older ETMC data to the continuum and physical pion mass limits. We mostly find remarkably good agreement with phenomenology, even though we cannot take the continuum and thermodynamic limits.",

We investigate excited states contributions with the nucleon quantum numbers by analyzing three sink-source time separations. We find that, for the scalar charge, excited states contribute significantly and to a less degree to the nucleon momentum fraction and helicity moment. Our analysis yields a value for the nucleon axial charge agrees with the experimental value and we predict a value of 1.027(62) in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme at 2 GeV for the isovector nucleon tensor charge directly at the physical point.

      "summary": "We propose a strategy to access the $q\\bar{q}$ component of the $ρ$ resonance in lattice QCD. Through a mixed action formalism (overlap valence on domain wall sea), the energy of the $q\\bar{q}$ component is derived at different valence quark masses, and shows a linear dependence on $m_π^2$. The slope is determined to be $c_1=0.505(3)\\,{\\rm GeV}^{-1}$, from which the valence $πρ$ sigma term is extracted to be $σ_{πρ}^{(\\rm val)}=9.82(6)$ MeV using the Feynman-Hellman theorem. At the physical pion mass, the mass of the $q\\bar{q}$ component is interpolated to be $m_ρ=775.9\\pm 6.0\\pm 1.8$ MeV, which is close to the $ρ$ resonance mass. We also obtain the leptonic decay constant of the $q\\bar{q}$ component to be $f_{ρ^-}=208.5\\pm 5.5\\pm 0.9$ MeV, which can be compared with the experimental value $f_ρ^{\\rm exp}\\approx 221$ MeV through the relation $f_ρ^{\\rm exp}=\\sqrt{Z_ρ}f_{ρ^\\pm} $ with $Z_ρ\\approx 1.13$ being the on-shell wavefunction renormalization of $ρ$ owing to the $ρ-π$ interaction. We emphasize that $m_ρ$ and $f_ρ$ of the $q\\bar{q}$ component, which are obtained for the first time from QCD, can be taken as the input parameters of $ρ$ in effective field theory studies where $ρ$ acts as a fundamental degree of freedom.",

The method is based on the gradient flow for gauge fields and is free from renormalization ambiguities. We test our method by computing the nucleon electric dipole moments in pure Yang-Mills theory at several lattice spacings, enabling a first-of-its-kind continuum extrapolation. The method is rather general and can be applied for any quantity computed in a $θ$ vacuum.

Once supplemented by a set of quantization conditions on the background-field parameters, this construction guarantees that no nonuniformity occurs in the hadronic correlation functions across the boundary of the lattice. The special cases of uniform electric and magnetic fields, a nonuniform electric field that varies linearly in one spatial coordinate (relevant to the determination of quadruple moment and charge radii), nonuniform electric and magnetic fields with given temporal and spatial dependences (relevant to the determination of nucleon spin polarizabilities) and plane-wave electromagnetic fields (relevant to the determination of electromagnetic form factors) are discussed explicitly.",

      "summary": "QCD with 2 flavours of massless colour-sextet quarks is studied as a possible walking-Technicolor candidate. We simulate the lattice version of this model at finite temperatures near to the chiral-symmetry restoration transition, to determine whether it is indeed a walking theory (QCD-like with a running coupling which evolves slowly over an appreciable range of length scales) or if it has an infrared fixed point, making it a conformal field theory. The lattice spacing at this transition is decreased towards zero by increasing the number $N_t$ of lattice sites in the temporal direction. Our simulations are performed at $N_t=4,6,8,12$, on lattices with spatial extent much larger than the temporal extent. A range of small fermion masses is chosen to make predictions for the chiral (zero mass) limit. We find that the bare lattice coupling does decrease as the lattice spacing is decreased. However, it decreases more slowly than would be predicted by asymptotic freedom. We discuss whether this means that the coupling is approaching a finite value as lattice $N_t$ is increased -- the conformal option, or if the apparent disagreement with the scaling predicted by asymptotic freedom is because the lattice coupling is a poor expansion parameter, and the theory walks. Currently, evidence favours QCD with 2 colour-sextet quarks being a conformal field theory. Other potential sources of disagreement with the walking hypothesis are also discussed.\n  We also report an estimate of the position of the deconfinement transition for $N_t=12$, needed for choosing parameters for zero-temperature simulations.",

This work presents an exploratory lattice QCD study of a TMD observable in the pion describing the Boer-Mulders effect, which is related to polarized quark transverse momentum in an unpolarized hadron. Particular emphasis is placed on the behavior as a function of a Collins-Soper evolution parameter quantifying the relative rapidity of the struck quark and the initial hadron, e.g., in a semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) process. The lattice calculation, performed at the pion mass m_pi = 518 MeV, utilizes a definition of TMDs via hadronic matrix elements of a quark bilocal operator with a staple-shaped gauge connection; in this context, the evolution parameter is related to the staple direction. By parametrizing the aforementioned matrix elements in terms of invariant amplitudes, the problem can be cast in a Lorentz frame suited for the lattice calculation. In contrast to an earlier nucleon study, due to the lower mass of the pion, the calculated data enable quantitative statements about the physically interesting limit of large relative rapidity. In passing, the similarity between the Boer-Mulders effects extracted in the pion and the nucleon is noted.",

      "summary": "We compute the renormalized running coupling of SU(3) gauge theory coupled to N_f = 2 flavors of massless Dirac fermions in the 2-index-symmetric (sextet) representation. This model is of particular interest as a minimal realization of the strongly interacting composite Higgs scenario. A recently proposed finite volume gradient flow scheme is used. The calculations are performed at several lattice spacings with two different implementations of the gradient flow allowing for a controlled continuum extrapolation and particular attention is paid to estimating the systematic uncertainties. For small values of the renormalized coupling our results for the beta-function agree with perturbation theory. For moderate couplings we observe a downward deviation relative to the 2-loop beta-function but in the coupling range where the continuum extrapolation is fully under control we do not observe an infrared fixed point. The explored range includes the locations of the zero of the 3-loop and the 4-loop beta-functions in the MSbar scheme. The absence of a non-trivial zero in the beta-function in the explored range of the coupling is consistent with our earlier findings based on hadronic observables, the chiral condensate and the GMOR relation. The present work is the first to report continuum non-perturbative results for the sextet model.",

      "summary": "We report on a calculation of the B*Bpi coupling in lattice QCD. The strong matrix element for a B* to Bpi transition is directly related to the leading order low-energy constant in heavy meson chiral perturbation theory (HMChPT) for B mesons. We carry out our calculation directly at the b-quark mass using a non-perturbatively tuned clover action that controls discretization effects of order pa and (ma)^n for all n. Our analysis is performed on RBC/UKQCD gauge configurations using domain-wall fermions and the Iwasaki gauge action at two lattice spacings of ainverse = 1.729(25) GeV, ainverse = 2.281(28) GeV, and unitary pion masses down to 290 MeV. We achieve good statistical precision and control all systematic uncertainties, giving a final result for the HMChPT coupling g_b = 0.56(3)stat(7)sys in the continuum and at the physical light-quark masses. This is the first calculation performed directly at the physical b-quark mass and lies in the region one would expect from carrying out an interpolation between previous results at the charm mass and at the static point.",

      "summary": "We present results for the iso-vector and flavor diagonal tensor charges $g^{u-d}_T$, $g^{u}_T$, $g^{d}_T$, and $g^{s}_T$ needed to probe novel tensor interactions at the TeV scale in neutron and nuclear $β$-decays and the contribution of the quark electric dipole moment (EDM) to the neutron EDM. The lattice QCD calculations were done using nine ensembles of gauge configurations generated by the MILC collaboration using the HISQ action with 2+1+1 dynamical flavors. These ensembles span three lattice spacings $a \\approx 0.06, 0.09$ and $0.12 $ fm and three quark masses corresponding to the pion masses $M_π\\approx 130, 220$ and $310 $ MeV. Using estimates from these ensembles, we quantify all systematic uncertainties and perform a simultaneous extrapolation in the lattice spacing, volume and light quark masses for the connected contributions. The final estimates of the connected nucleon (proton) tensor charge for the iso-vector combination is $g_T^{u-d} = 1.020(76) $ in the $\\bar{\\text{MS}}$ scheme at $2$ GeV. The additional disconnected quark loop contributions needed for the flavor-diagonal matrix elements are calculated using a stochastic estimator employing the truncated solver method with the all-mode-averaging technique. We find that the size of the disconnected contribution is smaller than the statistical error in the connected contribution. This allows us to bound the disconnected contribution and include it as an additional uncertainty in the flavor-diagonal charges. After a continuum extrapolation, we find $g_T^{u} = 0.774(66) $, $g_T^{d} = -0.233(28) $ and $g_T^{u+d} = 0.541(67) $. The strangeness tensor charge, that can make a significant contribution to the neutron EDM due to the large ratio $m_s/m_{u,d}$, is $g_T^{s}=0.008(9)$ in the continuum limit.",

We work within the framework of $SU(3)$ chiral perturbation theory and work through next-to-next-to-leading order in the $SU(3)$ chiral expansion, which is $\\mathcal{O}(m_q^2)$. At lowest order, the CP-odd couplings induced by the QCD $\\barθ$ term are determined by mass splittings of the baryon octet, the classic result of Crewther et al. We show that for each isospin-invariant CP-violating nucleon-meson interaction there exists one relation which is respected by loop corrections up to the order we work, while other leading-order relations are violated. With these relations we extract a precise value of the pion-nucleon coupling $\\bar g_0$ by using recent lattice QCD evaluations of the proton-neutron mass splitting. In addition, we derive semi-precise values for CP-violating coupling constants between heavier mesons and nucleons with $\\sim 30\\%$ uncertainty and discuss their phenomenological impact on electric dipole moments of nucleons and nuclei.",

      "summary": "Lattice QCD with background magnetic fields is used to calculate the magnetic moments and magnetic polarizabilities of the nucleons and of light nuclei with $A\\le4$, along with the cross-section for the $M1$ transition $np\\rightarrow dγ$, at the flavor SU(3)-symmetric point where the pion mass is $m_π\\sim 806$ MeV. These magnetic properties are extracted from nucleon and nuclear energies in six uniform magnetic fields of varying strengths. The magnetic moments are presented in a recent Letter. For the charged states, the extraction of the polarizability requires careful treatment of Landau levels, which enter non-trivially in the method that is employed. The nucleon polarizabilities are found to be of similar magnitude to their physical values, with $β_p=5.22(+0.66/-0.45)(0.23) \\times 10^{-4}$ fm$^3$ and $β_n=1.253(+0.056/-0.067)(0.055) \\times 10^{-4}$ fm$^3$, exhibiting a significant isovector component. The dineutron is bound at these heavy quark masses and its magnetic polarizability, $β_{nn}=1.872(+0.121/-0.113)(0.082) \\times 10^{-4}$ fm$^3$ differs significantly from twice that of the neutron. A linear combination of deuteron scalar and tensor polarizabilities is determined by the energies of the $j_z=\\pm 1$ deuteron states, and is found to be $β_{d,\\pm 1}=4.4(+1.6/-1.5)(0.2) \\times 10^{-4}$ fm$^3$. The magnetic polarizabilities of the three-nucleon and four-nucleon systems are found to be positive and similar in size to those of the proton, $β_{^{3}\\rm He}=5.4(+2.2/-2.1)(0.2) \\times 10^{-4}$ fm$^3$, $β_{^{3}\\rm H}=2.6(1.7)(0.1) \\times 10^{-4}$ fm$^3$, $β_{^{4}\\rm He}=3.4(+2.0/-1.9)(0.2) \\times 10^{-4}$ fm$^3$. Mixing between the $j_z=0$ deuteron state and the spin-singlet $np$ state induced by the background magnetic field is used to extract the short-distance two-nucleon counterterm, ${\\bar L}_1$, of the pionless effective theory for $NN$ systems (equivalent to the meson-exchange current contribution in nuclear potential models), that dictates the cross-section for the $np\\to dγ$ process near threshold. Combined with previous determinations of NN scattering parameters, this enables an ab initio determination of the threshold cross-section at these unphysical masses.",

      "summary": "Two-loop anomalous dimensions and one-loop renormalization scheme matching factors are calculated for six-quark operators responsible for neutron-antineutron transitions. When combined with lattice QCD determinations of the matrix elements of these operators, our results can be used to reliably predict the neutron-antineutron vacuum transition time, $τ_{n\\bar{n}}$, in terms of basic parameters of baryon-number violating beyond-the-Standard-Model theories. The operators are classified by their chiral transformation properties, and a basis in which there is no operator mixing due to strong interactions is identified. Operator projectors that are required for non-perturbative renormalization of the corresponding lattice QCD six-quark operator matrix elements are constructed. A complete calculation of $δm = 1/τ_{n\\bar{n}}$ in a particular beyond-the-Standard-Model theory is presented as an example to demonstrate how operator renormalization and results from lattice QCD are combined with experimental bounds on $δm$ to constrain the scale of new baryon-number violating physics. At the present computationally accessible lattice QCD matching scale of $\\sim$ 2 GeV, the next-to-next-to-leading-order effects calculated in this work correct the leading-order plus next-to-leading-order $δm$ predictions of beyond-the-Standard-Model theories by $< 26\\%$. Next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-order effects provide additional unknown corrections to predictions of $δm$ that are estimated to be $< 7\\%$.",

The real part of $A_0$ is CP conserving and serves as a test of our method while the result for Re$(\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon)$ provides a new test of the standard-model theory of CP violation, one which can be made more accurate with increasing computer capability.",

Non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) bottom quarks and Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) charm and light quarks are employed together with $N_f = 2+1$ MILC gauge configurations. A joint fit to our lattice and BaBar experimental data allows an extraction of the CKM matrix element $|V_{cb}|$. We also determine the phenomenologically interesting ratio $R(D) = {\\cal B}(B \\rightarrow D τν_τ) / {\\cal B}(B \\rightarrow D l ν_l)$ ($l = e, μ$). We find $|V_{cb}|_{excl.}^{B \\rightarrow D} = 0.0402(17)(13)$, where the first error consists of the lattice simulation errors and the experimental statistical error and the second error is the experimental systematic error. For the branching fraction ratio we find $R(D) = 0.300(8)$.",

The lattice construction necessarily involves U(1) flat directions, and we show how these can be lifted without violating the exact lattice supersymmetry. The basic idea is to modify the equations of motion of an auxiliary field, which determine the moduli space of the system. Applied to numerical calculations, the resulting improved lattice action leads to dramatically reduced violations of supersymmetric Ward identities and much more rapid approach to the continuum limit.",

In nuclear potential models, such contributions are described by phenomenological meson-exchange currents, while in the present work, they are determined directly from the quark and gluon interactions of QCD. Calculations of neutron-proton energy levels in multiple background magnetic fields are performed at two values of the quark masses, corresponding to pion masses of $m_π\\sim 450$ and 806 MeV, and are combined with pionless nuclear effective field theory to determine these low-energy inelastic processes.

      "summary": "In a recent paper we used chiral perturbation theory to determine the phase diagram and pion spectrum for Wilson and twisted-mass fermions at non-zero lattice spacing with non-degenerate up and down quarks. Here we extend this work to include the effects of electromagnetism, so that it is applicable to recent simulations incorporating all sources of isospin breaking. For Wilson fermions, we find that the phase diagram is unaffected by the inclusion of electromagnetism---the only effect is to raise the charged pion masses. For maximally twisted fermions, we previously took the twist and isospin-breaking directions to be different, in order that the fermion determinant is real and positive. However, this is incompatible with electromagnetic gauge invariance, and so here we take the twist to be in the isospin-breaking direction, following the RM123 collaboration. We map out the phase diagram in this case, which has not previously been studied. The results differ from those obtained with different twist and isospin directions. One practical issue when including electromagnetism is that the critical masses for up and down quarks differ. We show that one of the criteria suggested to determine these critical masses does not work, and propose an alternative.",

For the first time, both $G_E^s$ and $G_M^s$ are shown to be nonzero with high significance. This work uses closer-to-physical lattice parameters than previous calculations, and achieves an unprecedented statistical precision by implementing a recently proposed variance reduction technique called hierarchical probing. We perform model-independent fits of the form factor shapes using the $z$-expansion and determine the strange electric and magnetic radii and magnetic moment.

Our lattice formulation retains a single exact supersymmetry at non-zero lattice spacing, and contains $N_f$ fermions in the fundamental representation of a $U(N_c)$ gauge group. The lattice action we employ contains an additional Fayet-Iliopoulos term which is also invariant under the exact lattice supersymmetry. This work constitutes the first numerical study of this theory which serves as a toy model for understanding some of the issues that are expected to arise in four dimensional super QCD. We present evidence that the exact supersymmetry breaks spontaneously when $N_f<N_c$ in agreement with theoretical expectations.",

      "summary": "We employ a continuum approach to the three valence-quark bound-state problem in relativistic quantum field theory to predict a range of properties of the proton's radial excitation and thereby unify them with those of numerous other hadrons. Our analysis indicates that the nucleon's first radial excitation is the Roper resonance. It consists of a core of three dressed-quarks, which expresses its valence-quark content and whose charge radius is 80% larger than the proton analogue. That core is complemented by a meson cloud, which reduces the observed Roper mass by roughly 20%. The meson cloud materially affects long-wavelength characteristics of the Roper electroproduction amplitudes but the quark core is revealed to probes with $Q^2 \\gtrsim 3 m_N^2$.",

      "summary": "We report a quark spin calculation from the anomalous Ward identity with overlap fermions on 2+1 flavor dynamical fermion configurations with light sea quark masses. Such a formulation decomposes the divergence of the flavor-singlet axial-vector current into a quark pseudoscalar term and a triangle anomaly term, flavor by flavor. A large negative contribution from the anomaly term is observed and it is canceled within errors by the contribution from the pseudoscalar term in the disconnected insertion in the heavy quark region. On the other hand, net negative contributions are obtained for the light and strange quarks in the disconnected insertion, since their quark pseudoscalar terms are smaller than that of the heavy quark. Our results are obtained from the 2+1 flavor domain wall fermion configurations on the 24^3*64 lattice with a-1 = 1.78(5) GeV and the light sea quark at m_π = 330 MeV. We use the overlap fermion for the valence and the quark loop so that the renormalization constants Z_m and Z_P cancel in the pseudoscalar operator 2mP. In addition, the overlap Dirac operator is used to calculate the local topological charge in the anomaly so that there is no renormalization for the anomaly term either. In this study, we find the total quark spin to be small mainlyly due to the large negative anomaly term which could be the source for the 'proton spin crisis'.",

Two additional pion masses, approximately 440 MeV and 285 MeV, are added to our previous work at 545 MeV. The simulations were performed at 3 or 4 lattice spacings at each pion mass. The renormalized chiral condensate, strange quark number susceptibility and Polyakov loop is obtained as a function of the temperature and we observe a decrease in the light chiral pseudo-critical temperature as the pion mass is lowered while the pseudo-critical temperature associated with the strange quark number susceptibility or the Polyakov loop is only mildly sensitive to the pion mass. These findings are in agreement with previous continuum results obtained in the staggered formulation.",

Our prediction for the form factor is f+(0)=0.9685(34)(14) where the first error is statistical and the second error systematic.

For the fixed $m_d\\not=0$, the neutral pion becomes massless at two values of $m_u$, between which a spontaneously CP broken phase appears with the neutral pion condensation. We then show that the topological susceptibility diverges at these two critical points. We also consider the case of $m_u=m_d$ but $θ=π$, equivalently $m_u= - m_d$ with $θ= 0$ by the chiral rotation and show that the CP symmetry is spontaneously broken by the $η$ condensation at small $m$. Around $m=0$, three pions become Nambu-Goldstone modes, showing non-standard behavior that $m_π^2 = O(m^2)$, which, however, is consistent with the chiral Ward-Takahashi identities.}",

In this paper we generalize the results of Lüscher, and Lellouch and Lüscher, which determine the leading order effects of finite volume on the two-particle spectrum and two-particle decay amplitudes to determine the finite-volume effects in the second order mixing of the $K^0$ and $\\overline{K^0}$ states. We extend the methods of Kim, Sachrajda and Sharpe to provide a direct, uniform treatment of these three, related, finite-volume corrections. In particular, the leading, finite-volume corrections to the $K_L$-$K_S$ mass difference $ΔM_K$ and the CP violating parameter $ε_K$ are determined, including the potentially large effects which can arise from the near degeneracy of the kaon mass and the energy of a finite-volume, two-pion state.",

This formulation provides an expansion in the hopping parameter $κ$ which we test with Monte Carlo simulations for a broad range of the inverse gauge coupling $β_{pl}$ and small values of the scalar self-coupling $λ$. In the opposite limit of infinitely large $λ$, the partition function can be written as a traced product of local tensors which allows us to write exact blocking formulas. Their numerical implementation requires truncations but there is no sign problem for arbitrary values of $μ$. We show that the time continuum limit of the blocked transfer matrix can be obtained numerically and, in the limit of infinite $β_{pl}$ and with a spin-1 truncation, the small volume energy spectrum is identical to the low energy spectrum of a two-species Bose-Hubbard model in the limit of large onsite repulsion. We extend this procedure for finite $β_{pl}$ and derive a spin-1 approximation of the Hamiltonian. It involves new terms corresponding to transitions among the two species in the Bose-Hubbard model. We propose an optical lattice implementation involving a ladder structure.",

      "summary": "We present a lattice-QCD calculation of the $B\\toπ\\ellν$ semileptonic form factors and a new determination of the CKM matrix element $|V_{ub}|$. We use the MILC asqtad 2+1-flavor lattice configurations at four lattice spacings and light-quark masses down to 1/20 of the physical strange-quark mass. We extrapolate the lattice form factors to the continuum using staggered chiral perturbation theory in the hard-pion and SU(2) limits. We employ a model-independent $z$ parameterization to extrapolate our lattice form factors from large-recoil momentum to the full kinematic range. We introduce a new functional method to propagate information from the chiral-continuum extrapolation to the $z$ expansion. We present our results together with a complete systematic error budget, including a covariance matrix to enable the combination of our form factors with other lattice-QCD and experimental results. To obtain $|V_{ub}|$, we simultaneously fit the experimental data for the $B\\toπ\\ellν$ differential decay rate obtained by the BaBar and Belle collaborations together with our lattice form-factor results. We find $|V_{ub}|=(3.72\\pm 0.16)\\times 10^{-3}$ where the error is from the combined fit to lattice plus experiments and includes all sources of uncertainty. Our form-factor results bring the QCD error on $|V_{ub}|$ to the same level as the experimental error. We also provide results for the $B\\toπ\\ellν$ vector and scalar form factors obtained from the combined lattice and experiment fit, which are more precisely-determined than from our lattice-QCD calculation alone. These results can be used in other phenomenological applications and to test other approaches to QCD.",

      "summary": "We present the first unquenched lattice-QCD calculation of the hadronic form factors for the exclusive decay $\\overline{B} \\rightarrow D \\ell \\overlineν$ at nonzero recoil. We carry out numerical simulations on fourteen ensembles of gauge-field configurations generated with 2+1 flavors of asqtad-improved staggered sea quarks. The ensembles encompass a wide range of lattice spacings (approximately 0.045 to 0.12 fm) and ratios of light (up and down) to strange sea-quark masses ranging from 0.05 to 0.4. For the $b$ and $c$ valence quarks we use improved Wilson fermions with the Fermilab interpretation, while for the light valence quarks we use asqtad-improved staggered fermions. We extrapolate our results to the physical point using rooted staggered heavy-light meson chiral perturbation theory. We then parameterize the form factors and extend them to the full kinematic range using model-independent functions based on analyticity and unitarity. We present our final results for $f_+(q^2)$ and $f_0(q^2)$, including statistical and systematic errors, as coefficients of a series in the variable $z$ and the covariance matrix between these coefficients. We then fit the lattice form-factor data jointly with the experimentally measured differential decay rate from BaBar to determine the CKM matrix element, $|V_{cb}|=(39.6 \\pm 1.7_{\\rm QCD+exp} \\pm 0.2_{\\rm QED})\\times 10^{-3}$. As a byproduct of the joint fit we obtain the form factors with improved precision at large recoil. Finally, we use them to update our calculation of the ratio $R(D)$ in the Standard Model, which yields $R(D) = 0.299(11)$.",

      "summary": "We consider multi-particle contributions to nucleon two- and three-point functions from the perspective of chiral dynamics. Lattice nucleon interpolating operators, which have definite chiral transformation properties, can be mapped into chiral perturbation theory. Using the most common of such operators, we determine pion-nucleon and pion-delta couplings to nucleon two- and three-point correlation functions at leading order in the low-energy expansion. The couplings of pions to nucleons and deltas in two-point functions are consistent with simple phase-space considerations, in accordance with the Lehmann spectral representation. An argument based on available phase space on a torus is utilized to derive the scaling of multiple-pion couplings. While multi-pion states are indeed suppressed, this suppression scales differently with particle number compared to that in infinite volume. For nucleon three-point correlation functions, we investigate the axial-vector current at vanishing momentum transfer. The effect of pion-nucleon and pion-delta states on the extraction of the nucleon axial charge is assessed. We show that couplings to finite volume multi-particle states could potentially lead to overestimation of the axial charge. Hence pion-nucleon excited states cannot explain the trend seen in lattice QCD calculations of the nucleon axial charge.",

      "summary": "We calculate the spin-independent scattering cross section for direct detection that results from the electromagnetic polarizability of a composite scalar baryon dark matter candidate -- \"Stealth Dark Matter\", that is based on a dark SU(4) confining gauge theory. In the nonrelativistic limit, electromagnetic polarizability proceeds through a dimension-7 interaction leading to a very small scattering cross section for dark matter with weak scale masses. This represents a lower bound on the scattering cross section for composite dark matter theories with electromagnetically charged constituents. We carry out lattice calculations of the polarizability for the lightest baryons in SU(3) and SU(4) gauge theories using the background field method on quenched configurations. We find the polarizabilities of SU(3) and SU(4) to be comparable (within about 50%) normalized to the baryon mass, which is suggestive for extensions to larger SU(N) groups. The resulting scattering cross sections with a xenon target are shown to be potentially detectable in the dark matter mass range of about 200-700 GeV, where the lower bound is from the existing LUX constraint while the upper bound is the coherent neutrino background. Significant uncertainties in the cross section remain due to the more complicated interaction of the polarizablity operator with nuclear structure, however the steep dependence on the dark matter mass, $1/m_B^6$, suggests the observable dark matter mass range is not appreciably modified. We briefly highlight collider searches for the mesons in the theory as well as the indirect astrophysical effects that may also provide excellent probes of stealth dark matter.",

      "summary": "We present a new model of \"Stealth Dark Matter\": a composite baryonic scalar of an $SU(N_D)$ strongly-coupled theory with even $N_D \\geq 4$. All mass scales are technically natural, and dark matter stability is automatic without imposing an additional discrete or global symmetry. Constituent fermions transform in vector-like representations of the electroweak group that permit both electroweak-breaking and electroweak-preserving mass terms. This gives a tunable coupling of stealth dark matter to the Higgs boson independent of the dark matter mass itself. We specialize to $SU(4)$, and investigate the constraints on the model from dark meson decay, electroweak precision measurements, basic collider limits, and spin-independent direct detection scattering through Higgs exchange. We exploit our earlier lattice simulations that determined the composite spectrum as well as the effective Higgs coupling of stealth dark matter in order to place bounds from direct detection, excluding constituent fermions with dominantly electroweak-breaking masses. A lower bound on the dark baryon mass $m_B \\gtrsim 300$ GeV is obtained from the indirect requirement that the lightest dark meson not be observable at LEP II. We briefly survey some intriguing properties of stealth dark matter that are worthy of future study, including: collider studies of dark meson production and decay; indirect detection signals from annihilation; relic abundance estimates for both symmetric and asymmetric mechanisms; and direct detection through electromagnetic polarizability, a detailed study of which will appear in a companion paper.",

      "summary": "We report on a scale determination with gradient-flow techniques on the $N_f=2+1+1$ highly improved staggered quark ensembles generated by the MILC Collaboration. The ensembles include four lattice spacings, ranging from approximately 0.15 to 0.06 fm, and both physical and unphysical values of the quark masses. The scales $\\sqrt{t_0}/a$ and $w_0/a$ and their tree-level improvements, $\\sqrt{t_{0,{\\rm imp}}}$ and $w_{0,{\\rm imp}}$, are computed on each ensemble using Symanzik flow and the cloverleaf definition of the energy density $E$. Using a combination of continuum chiral-perturbation theory and a Taylor-series ansatz for the lattice-spacing and strong-coupling dependence, the results are simultaneously extrapolated to the continuum and interpolated to physical quark masses. We determine the scales $\\sqrt{t_0} = 0.1416({}_{-5}^{+8})$ fm and $w_0 = 0.1714({}_{-12}^{+15})$ fm, where the errors are sums, in quadrature, of statistical and all systematic errors. The precision of $w_0$ and $\\sqrt{t_0}$ is comparable to or more precise than the best previous estimates, respectively. We then find the continuum mass dependence of $\\sqrt{t_0}$ and $w_0$, which will be useful for estimating the scales of new ensembles. We also estimate the integrated autocorrelation length of $\\langle E(t) \\rangle$. For long flow times, the autocorrelation length of $\\langle E \\rangle$ appears to be comparable to that of the topological charge.",

With three different pion mass values, the $s$-wave threshold scattering parameters, namely the scattering length $a_0$ and the effective range $r_0$, are extracted in $J^P=1^+$ channel. Our results indicate that, in this particular channel, the interaction between the two vector charmed mesons is weakly repulsive in nature hence do not support the possibility of a shallow bound state for the two mesons, at least for the pion mass values being studied. This study provides some useful information on the nature of the newly discovered resonance-like structure $Z_c(4025)$ observed in various experiments.",

Here we present a precise calculation of these form factors using lattice QCD with 2+1 flavors of dynamical domain-wall fermions. The $b$ and $c$ quarks are implemented with relativistic heavy-quark actions, allowing us to work directly at the physical heavy-quark masses. The lattice computation is performed for six different pion masses and two different lattice spacings, using gauge-field configurations generated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations. The $b \\to u$ and $b \\to c$ currents are renormalized with a mostly nonperturbative method. We extrapolate the form factor results to the physical pion mass and the continuum limit, parametrizing the $q^2$-dependence using $z$-expansions. The form factors are presented in such a way as to enable the correlated propagation of both statistical and systematic uncertainties into derived quantities such as differential decay rates and asymmetries. Using these form factors, we present predictions for the $Λ_b \\to p \\ell^- \\barν_\\ell$ and $Λ_b \\to Λ_c \\ell^- \\barν_\\ell$ differential and integrated decay rates. Combined with experimental data, our results enable determinations of $|V_{ub}|$, $|V_{cb}|$, and $|V_{ub}/V_{cb}|$ with theory uncertainties of 4.4%, 2.2%, and 4.9%, respectively.",

      "title": "Phases of SU(3) Gauge Theories with Fundamental Quarks via Dirac Spectral Density",
      "summary": "We propose that, in SU(3) gauge theories with fundamental quarks, confinement can be inferred from spectral density of the Dirac operator. This stems from the proposition that its possible behaviors are exhausted by three distinct types (Fig.1). The monotonic cases are standard and entail confinement with valence chiral symmetry breaking (A) or the lack of both (C,C'). The bimodal (anomalous) option (B) was frequently regarded as an artifact (lattice or other) in previous studies, but we show for the first time that it persists in the continuum limit, and conclude that it informs of a non-confining phase with broken valence chiral symmetry. This generalization rests on the following. $(α)$ We show that bimodality in $N_f$=0 theory past deconfinement temperature $T_c$ is stable with respect to removal of both infrared and ultraviolet cutoffs, indicating that anomalous phase is not an artifact. $(β)$ We demonstrate that transition to bimodality in $N_f$=0 is simultaneous with the loss of confinement: anomalous phase occurs for $T_c < T < T_{ch}$, where $T_{ch}$ is the valence chiral restoration temperature. $(γ)$ Evidence is presented for thermal anomalous phase in $N_f$=2+1 QCD at physical quark masses, whose onset too coincides with the conventional \"crossover $T_c$''. We conclude that the anomalous regime $T_c < T < T_{ch}$ is very likely a feature of nature's strong interactions. $(δ)$ Our past studies of zero-temperature $N_f$=12 theories revealed that bimodality also arises via purely light-quark effects. As a result, we expect to encounter anomalous phase on generic paths to valence chiral restoration. We predict its existence also for $N_f$ massless flavors ($T=0$) in the range $N_f^c < N_f < N_f^{ch}$, where $N_f^c$ could be quite low. Conventional arguments would associate $N_f^{ch}$ with the onset of conformal window.",

      "summary": "We investigate the low-lying eigenmodes of the Dirac matrix with the aim to gain more insight into the temperature dependence of the anomalous $U_A(1)$ symmetry. We use the overlap operator to probe dynamical QCD configurations generated with (2+1)-flavors of highly improved staggered quarks. We find no evidence of a gap opening up in the infrared region of the eigenvalue spectrum even at $1.5\\,T_c$, $T_c$ being the chiral crossover temperature. Instead, we observe an accumulation of near-zero eigenmodes. We argue that these near-zero eigenmodes are primarily responsible for the anomalous breaking of the axial symmetry still being effective. At $1.5\\,T_c$, these near-zero eigenmodes remain localized and their distribution is consistent with the dilute instanton gas picture. At this temperature, the average size of the instantons is $0.223(8)\\,\\text{fm}$ and their density is $0.147(7)\\,\\text{fm}^{-4}$.",

It highlights progress in hadron physics in the seven years since the 2007 Long Range Plan (LRP07), and presents a vision for the future by identifying key questions and plausible paths to solutions which should define our next decade. In defining the priority of outstanding physics opportunities for the future, both prospects for the short (roughly 5 years) and longer term (beyond 10 years) are identified together with the facilities, personnel and other resources needed to maximize the discovery potential in hadronic physics worldwide. In this connection, the potential of an electron ion collider is highlighted.",

We also report the ratio of the strange $< x >$ to that of $u/d$ in the disconnected insertion which will be useful in constraining the global fit of parton distribution functions at small $x$. We adopt overlap fermion action on $2 + 1$ flavor domain-wall fermion configurations on the $24^3 \\times 64$ lattice with a light sea quark mass which corresponds to $m_π=330$ MeV. Smeared grid $Z_3$ sources are deployed to calculate the nucleon propagator with low-mode substitution. Even-odd grid sources and time-dilution technique with stochastic noises are used to calculate the high mode contribution to the quark loop. Low mode averaging (LMA) for the quark loop is applied to reduce the statistical error of the disconnected insertion calculation. We find the ratio $< x >_s/< x >_{u/d}^{\\mathrm{DI}}= 0.78(3)$ in this study.",

Our result accommodates theories in which the final two-particle state is coupled to any number of other two-body channels, with all angular momentum states included. The derivation uses generic, fully relativistic field theory, and is exact up to exponentially suppressed corrections in the lightest particle mass times the box size. This work distinguishes itself from previous studies by accommodating particles with any intrinsic spin. To illustrate the utility of our general result, we discuss how it can be implemented for studies of $N+\\mathcal{J}~\\rightarrow~(Nπ,Nη,Nη',ΣK,ΛK)$ transitions, where $\\mathcal{J}$ is a generic external current. The reduction of rotational symmetry, due to the cubic finite volume, manifests in this example through the mixing of S- and P-waves when the system has nonzero total momentum.",

This is largely a consequence of the ability to perform continuum extrapolations with physical quark masses. Here we review recent progress in lattice QCD thermodynamics, focussing mainly on results that benefit from the use of physical quark masses: the crossover temperature, the equation of state, and fluctuations of the quark number susceptibilities. In addition, we place a special emphasis on calculations that are directly relevant to the study of relativistic heavy ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC.",

Calculations are performed on anisotropic lattices of size 16^3 X 128, with inverse spacing in temporal direction 1/a_t = 5.67(4) GeV and with a pion mass of about 390 MeV. A large set of baryonic operators that respect the symmetries of the lattice yet which retain a memory of their continuum analogues are used. These operators transform as irreducible representations of SU(3) symmetry for flavor, SU(4) symmetry for Dirac spins of quarks and O(3) for spatial symmetry. The distillation method is utilized to generate baryon correlation functions which are analysed using the variational fitting method to extract excited states. The lattice spectra obtained have baryonic states with well-defined total spins up to 7/2 and the pattern of low lying states does not support the diquark picture for doubly charmed baryons. On the contrary the calculated spectra are remarkably similar to the expectations from models with an SU(6)X O(3) symmetry. Various spin dependent energy splittings between the extracted states are also evaluated.",

      "summary": "We derive a model-independent expression for finite-volume matrix elements. Specifically, we present a relativistic, non-perturbative analysis of the matrix element of an external current between a one-scalar in-state and a two-scalar out-state. Our result, which is valid for energies below higher-particle inelastic thresholds, generalizes the Lellouch-Luscher formula in two ways: we allow the external current to inject arbitrary momentum into the system and we allow for the final state to be composed an arbitrary number of strongly coupled two-particle states with arbitrary partial waves (including partial-wave mixing induced by the volume). We also illustrate how our general result can be applied to some key examples, such as heavy meson decays and meson photo production. Finally, we point out complications that arise involving unstable resonance states, such as $B\\rightarrow K^*\\ell^+\\ell^-$ when staggered or mixed-action/partially-quenched calculations are performed.",

      "summary": "Baryon number symmetry violating theories beyond the standard model with suppressed proton decay rates can be experimentally constrained by data on neutron-antineutron transition rates. In order to apply this constraints, theoretical predictions for the neutron-antineutron transition rates in various models must be available for comparison. Reliable predictions of transition rates between hadronic states must include non-perturbative quantum chromodynamic effects. These can be calculated in a model independent way by calculating six-quark operator matrix elements with lattice quantum chromodynamics. Preliminary lattice calculations have been performed, but operator renormalization effects must be included in order to match beyond the standard model calculations performed in $\\overline{MS}$ renormalized perturbation theory with lattice regularized matrix element results. In particular, a perturbative calculation of the two-loop anomalous dimensions and one-loop renormalization scheme matching coefficients of these six-quark operators is necessary in order to determine leading order corrections at lattice matching scales. This describes our ongoing calculation of these perturbative operator renormalization effects.",

Extending previous studies we outline our strategy as we investigate Goldstone dynamics and Electroweak scale setting from chiral symmetry breaking ($χ$ SB), test the GMOR relation from the spectrum of the Dirac operator and the related chiral condensate, begin to develop and test mixed action based improved analysis of $χ$ SB with new run plans at fixed topology to cross over from the p-regime to the epsilon-regime of $χ$ SB, continue to pursue the light $0^{++}$ scalar and its relation to the dilaton, and probe the scale-dependent running coupling from the perturbative UV scale to the scale of chiral symmetry breaking. Our observations suggest that the model is very close to the conformal window and a light composite scalar, perhaps the Higgs impostor with or without dilaton-like interpretation, appears to emerge with $0^{++}$ quantum numbers. The lightest baryon of the model on the 3 TeV scale has intriguing implications.",

The method is easy to implement and can be applied to any lattice gauge theory of interest both in step scaling studies and for scale setting.

Lattices with temporal extent $N_t=6$, 8, 10 and 12 were used.

Using ensembles at three values of the lattice spacing ($a=0.12,\\ 0.09,$ and $0.06$ fm) and three values of the quark mass ($M_π\\approx 310,\\ 220$ and $130$ MeV) we find that the estimates of the tensor charge are stable and it can be extracted with $5\\%$ precision with O(10,000) measurements. We also find that higher statistics are needed to resolve the various uncertainties in the calculation of $g_A$ and improve the signal in $g_S$, which with present data has large errors.

These operators are constructed as linear combinations in a large basis of meson interpolating fields using a variational analysis of matrices of two-point correlation functions. After performing such a determination at both zero and non-zero momentum, we compute three-point functions and are able to study radiative transition matrix elements featuring excited state mesons. The required two- and three-point correlation functions are efficiently computed using the distillation framework in which there is a factorization between quark propagation and operator construction, allowing for a large number of meson operators of definite momentum to be considered. We illustrate the method with a calculation using anisotopic lattices having three flavors of dynamical quark all tuned to the physical strange quark mass, considering form-factors and transitions of pseudoscalar and vector meson excitations. The dependence on photon virtuality for a number of form-factors and transitions is extracted and some discussion of excited-state phenomenology is presented.",

In this proceeding we present our updated results for the spectrum obtained with the HISQ action at two lattice spacings, several volumes and fermion masses. In particular, we emphasize the existence of a flavor-singlet scalar state parametrically light with respect to the rest of the spectrum, first reported in our paper. This feature is expected to be present for theories in the conformal window, but the lattice calculation of such a state is difficult and requires noise-reduction techniques together with large statistics, in order to evaluate disconnected diagrams. Being able to provide a robust observed connection between a light flavor-singlet scalar and (near-)conformality is an important step towards observing a light composite Higgs boson in walking technicolor theories on the lattice. We also show updated results for the mass anomalous dimension $γ_m$ obtained from various spectral quantities, including the string tension, under the assumption that the theory is inside the conformal window.",

      "summary": "Electromagnetic polarizabilities are important parameters for understanding the interaction between photons and hadrons. For pions these quantities are poorly constrained experimentally since they can only be measured indirectly. New experiments at CERN and Jefferson Lab are planned that will measure the polarizabilities more precisely. Lattice QCD can be used to compute these quantities directly in terms of quark and gluons degrees of freedom, using the background field method. We present results for the electric polarizability for two different quark masses, light enough to connect to chiral perturbation theory. These are currently the lightest quark masses used in polarizability studies.",

      "summary": "We calculate the $B \\toπ\\ellν$ and $B_s \\to K \\ellν$ form factors in dynamical lattice QCD. We use the (2+1)-flavor RBC-UKQCD gauge-field ensembles generated with the domain-wall fermion and Iwasaki gauge actions. For the $b$ quarks we use the anisotropic clover action with a relativistic heavy-quark interpretation. We analyze two lattice spacings $a \\approx 0.11, 0.086$ fm and unitary pion masses as light as $M_π\\approx 290$ MeV. We simultaneously extrapolate our numerical results to the physical light-quark masses and to the continuum and interpolate in the pion/kaon energy using SU(2) \"hard-pion\" chiral perturbation theory. We provide complete error budgets for the form factors $f_+(q^2)$ and $f_0(q^2)$ at three momenta that span the $q^2$ range accessible in our numerical simulations. We extrapolate these results to $q^2 = 0$ using a model-independent $z$-parametrization and present our final form factors as the $z$-coefficients and the matrix of correlations between them. Our results agree with other lattice determinations using staggered light quarks and provide important independent cross-checks. Both $B \\toπ\\ellν$ and $B_s \\to K \\ellν$ decays enable a determination of the CKM matrix element $|V_{ub}|$. To illustrate this, we perform a combined $z$-fit of our numerical $B\\toπ\\ellν$ form-factor data with the experimental branching-fraction measurements leaving the relative normalization as a free parameter; we obtain $|V_{ub}| = 3.61(32) \\times 10^{-3}$, where the error includes statistical and systematic uncertainties. This approach can be applied to $B_s\\to K \\ellν$ decay to determine $|V_{ub}|$ once the process has been measured experimentally. Finally, in anticipation of future measurements, we make predictions for $B \\to π\\ellν$ and $B_s\\to K \\ellν$ Standard-Model differential branching fractions and forward-backward asymmetries.",

The smeared operator product expansion formally connects nonperturbative matrix elements determined numerically using lattice field theory to matrix elements of nonlocal operators in the continuum. These nonperturbative matrix elements do not suffer from power-divergent mixing on the lattice, which significantly complicates calculations of quantities such as the moments of parton distribution functions, provided the smearing scale is kept fixed in the continuum limit. The presence of this smearing scale complicates the connection to the Wilson coefficients of the standard operator product expansion and requires the construction of a suitable formalism. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with examples in real scalar field theory.",

The free energies calculated from the Polyakov loop correlators are extrapolated to the continuum limit. For the free energies we use a two step renormalization procedure that only uses data at finite temperature. We also measure correlators with definite Euclidean time reversal and charge conjugation symmetry to extract two different screening masses, one in the magnetic, and one in the electric sector, to distinguish two different correlation lengths in the full Polyakov loop correlator.",

These unquenched calculations, performed in the low-recoil kinematic regime, provide a significant improvement over the use of extrapolated light cone sum rule results. The fits presented here include further kinematic constraints and estimates of additional correlations between the different form factor shape parameters. We use these form factors along with Standard Model determinations of Wilson coefficients to give Standard Model predictions for several observables [arXiv:1310.3887]. The modest improvements to the form factor fits lead to improved determinations of $F_L$, the fraction of longitudinally polarized vector mesons, but have little effect on most other observables.",
