      "summary": "We examine the possibility of dynamical supersymmetry breaking in two-dimensional $\\mathcal{N} = (2, 2)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The theory is discretized on a Euclidean spacetime lattice using a supersymmetric lattice action. We compute the vacuum energy of the theory at finite temperature and take the zero temperature limit. Supersymmetry will be spontaneously broken in this theory if the measured ground state energy is non-zero. By performing simulations on a range of lattices up to $96 \\times 96$ we are able to perform a careful extrapolation to the continuum limit for a wide range of temperatures. Subsequent extrapolations to the zero temperature limit yield an upper bound on the ground state energy density. We find the energy density to be statistically consistent with zero in agreement with the absence of dynamical supersymmetry breaking in this theory.",

      "summary": "We present the first lattice-QCD calculation of the kaon distribution amplitude using the large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) approach. The momentum-smearing technique has been implemented to improve signals at large meson momenta. We subtract the power divergence due to Wilson line to high precision using multiple lattice spacings. The kaon structure clearly shows an asymmetry of the distribution amplitude around $x=1/2$, a clear sign of its skewness. We also study the leading SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking relations for the pion, kaon and eta meson distribution amplitudes, and the results are consistent with the prediction from chiral perturbation theory.",

We find that there are $L_s-1$ extra poles of Möbius domain-wall fermions in addition to the pole which realizes the physical mode in the continuum limit.

      "summary": "We calculate the leptonic decay constants of heavy-light pseudoscalar mesons with charm and bottom quarks in lattice quantum chromodynamics on four-flavor QCD gauge-field configurations with dynamical $u$, $d$, $s$, and $c$ quarks. We analyze over twenty isospin-symmetric ensembles with six lattice spacings down to $a\\approx 0.03$~fm and several values of the light-quark mass down to the physical value $\\frac{1}{2}(m_u+m_d)$. We employ the highly-improved staggered-quark (HISQ) action for the sea and valence quarks; on the finest lattice spacings, discretization errors are sufficiently small that we can calculate the $B$-meson decay constants with the HISQ action for the first time directly at the physical $b$-quark mass. We obtain the most precise determinations to-date of the $D$- and $B$-meson decay constants and their ratios, $f_{D^+} = 212.7(0.6)$~MeV, $f_{D_s} = 249.9(0.4)$~MeV, $f_{D_s}/f_{D^+} = 1.1749(16)$, $f_{B^+} = 189.4 (1.4)$~MeV, $f_{B_s} = 230.7(1.3)$~MeV, $f_{B_s}/f_{B^+} = 1.2180(47)$, where the errors include statistical and all systematic uncertainties. Our results for the $B$-meson decay constants are three times more precise than the previous best lattice-QCD calculations, and bring the QCD errors in the Standard-Model predictions for the rare leptonic decays $\\overline{\\mathcal{B}}(B_s \\to μ^+μ^-) = 3.64(11) \\times 10^{-9}$, $\\overline{\\mathcal{B}}(B^0 \\to μ^+μ^-) = 1.00(3) \\times 10^{-10}$, and $\\overline{\\mathcal{B}}(B^0 \\to μ^+μ^-)/\\overline{\\mathcal{B}}(B_s \\to μ^+μ^-) = 0.0273(9)$ to well below other sources of uncertainty. As a byproduct of our analysis, we also update our previously published results for the light-quark-mass ratios and the scale-setting quantities $f_{p4s}$, $M_{p4s}$, and $R_{p4s}$. We obtain the most precise lattice-QCD determination to date of the ratio $f_{K^+}/f_{π^+} = 1.1950(^{+16}_{-23})$~MeV.",

We report results from high precision analysis of the twelve-flavor $β$-function \\cite{Fodor:2016zil} refuting its published IRFP \\cite{Cheng:2014jba,Hasenfratz:2016dou}. We present our objections to recent claims \\cite{Hasenfratz:2017mdh,Hasenfratz:2017qyr} for non-universal behavior of staggered fermions used in our analysis. We also report our first analysis of dilaton tests of the light $0^{++}$ scalar in the sextet model and comment on related post-conference developments. The dilaton test is the main thrust of this conference contribution including presentation #405 on the $n_f=12$ $β$-function and presentation #260 on dilaton tests of the sextet model. They are both selected from the near-conformal BSM paradigm.",

      "summary": "The study of heavy-light meson masses should provide a way to determine renormalized quark masses and other properties of heavy-light mesons. In the context of lattice QCD, for example, it is possible to calculate hadronic quantities for arbitrary values of the quark masses. In this paper, we address two aspects relating heavy-light meson masses to the quark masses. First, we introduce a definition of the renormalized quark mass that is free of both scale dependence and renormalon ambiguities, and discuss its relation to more familiar definitions of the quark mass. We then show how this definition enters a merger of the descriptions of heavy-light masses in heavy-quark effective theory and in chiral perturbation theory ($χ$PT). For practical implementations of this merger, we extend the one-loop $χ$PT corrections to lattice gauge theory with heavy-light mesons composed of staggered fermions for both quarks. Putting everything together, we obtain a practical formula to describe all-staggered heavy-light meson masses in terms of quark masses as well as some lattice artifacts related to staggered fermions. In a companion paper, we use this function to analyze lattice-QCD data and extract quark masses and some matrix elements defined in heavy-quark effective theory.",

      "summary": "We present a detailed study of the applications of two stochastic approaches, stochastic optimization method (SOM) and stochastic analytical inference (SAI), to extract spectral functions from Euclidean correlation functions. SOM has the advantage that it does not require prior information. On the other hand, SAI is a more generalized method based on Bayesian inference. Under mean field approximation SAI reduces to the often-used maximum entropy method (MEM), and for a specific choice of the prior SAI becomes equivalent to SOM. To test the applicability of these two stochastic methods to lattice QCD, firstly, we apply these methods to various reasonably chosen model correlation functions, and present detailed comparisons of the reconstructed spectral functions obtained from SOM, SAI and MEM. Next, we present similar studies for charmonia correlation functions obtained from lattice QCD computations using clover-improved Wilson fermions on large, fine, isotropic lattices at $0.75$ and $1.5T_c$, $T_c$ being the deconfinement transition temperature of a pure gluon plasma. We find that SAI and SOM give consistent results to MEM at these two temperatures.",

      "summary": "Complete flavour decompositions of the scalar, axial and tensor charges of the proton, deuteron, diproton and $^3$He at SU(3)-symmetric values of the quark masses corresponding to a pion mass $m_π\\sim806$ MeV are determined using lattice QCD. At the physical quark masses, the scalar charges constrain mean-field models of nuclei and the low-energy interactions of nuclei with potential dark matter candidates. The axial and tensor charges of nuclei constrain their spin content, integrated transversity and the quark contributions to their electric dipole moments. External fields are used to directly access the quark-line connected matrix elements of quark bilinear operators, and a combination of stochastic estimation techniques is used to determine the disconnected sea-quark contributions. Significant nuclear modifications are found, with particularly large, O(10%), effects in the scalar charges. Typically, these nuclear effects reduce the effective charge of the nucleon (quenching), although in some cases an enhancement is not excluded. Given the size of the nuclear modifications of the scalar charges resolved here, contributions from correlated multi-nucleon effects should be quantified in the analysis of dark matter direct-detection experiments using nuclear targets.",

The canonical approach is a powerful tool to investigate sign problem in Lattice QCD. The central part of the canonical approach is the fugacity expansion of the grand canonical partition functions. Canonical partition functions $Z_n(T)$ are coefficients of this expansion. Using various methods we study properties of $Z_n(T)$. At the last step we perform cubic spline for temperature dependence of $Z_n(T)$ at fixed $n$ and compute baryon number susceptibility $χ_B/T^2$ as function of temperature. After that we compute numerically $\\partialχ/ \\partial T$ and restore crossover line in QCD phase diagram. We use improved Wilson fermions and Iwasaki gauge action on the $16^3 \\times 4$ lattice with $m_π/m_ρ = 0.8$ as a sandbox to check the canonical approach. In this framework we obtain coefficient in parametrization of crossover line $T_c(μ_B^2)=T_c\\left(c-κ\\, μ_B^2/T_c^2\\right)$ with $κ= -0.0453 \\pm 0.0099$.",

This is based on the Rome method for computing momentum derivatives of quark propagators. We apply this procedure to extract the nucleon isovector magnetic moment and charge radius as well as the isovector induced pseudoscalar form factor at $Q^2=0$ and the axial radius. For comparison, we also determine these quantities with the traditional approach of computing the corresponding form factors, i.e. $G^v_E(Q^2)$ and $G_M^v(Q^2)$ for the case of the vector current and $G_P^v(Q^2)$ and $G_A^v(Q^2)$ for the axial current, at multiple $Q^2$ values followed by $z$-expansion fits. We perform our calculations at the physical pion mass using a 2HEX-smeared Wilson-clover action. To control the effects of excited-state contamination, the calculations were done at three source-sink separations and the summation method was used. The derivative method produces results consistent with those from the traditional approach but with larger statistical uncertainties especially for the isovector charge and axial radii.",

This provides a test of systematic errors in the lattice QCD determination of the $B$ meson decay constants and form factors. We provide a new value for the $B$ and $B_s$ meson decay constants from lattice QCD calculations on ensembles that include $u$, $d$, $s$ and $c$ quarks in the sea and those which have the $u/d$ quark mass going down to its physical value. Our results are $f_B=0.196(6)$ GeV, $f_{B_s}=0.236(7)$ GeV and $f_{B_s}/f_B =1.207(7)$, agreeing well with earlier results using the temporal axial current.

Lett. 118, 242001 (2017), arXiv:1703.01153) that the time-ordered current-curent correlator in the nucleon calculated on the lattice is to be identified as the forward Compton amplitude so that it is related to the sum of the even moments of the structure function as in the Minkowski space in the continuum. We point out two problems with this identification. First of all, the current-current correlator defined in the Euclidean space is not analytic everywhere on the rest of the complex $ν$ or $ω$ plane, besides the cuts on the real axis. As such, there is no dispersion relation to relate it to its imaginary part and hence the moments of the structure function. On the lattice, there is an additional difficulty in that the higher dimensional local operators from the operator production expansion (OPE) of the current-current product can mix with lower dimensional higher-twist operators which leads to divergences in the powers of inverse lattice spacing. This mixing needs to be removed before their matrix elements can be identified as the moments of the structure function.",

The ensembles are generated with dynamical Möbius domain-wall or reweighted overlap fermions. The $U(1)_A$ susceptibility is extracted from the low-modes spectrum of the overlap Dirac eigenvalues.

      "summary": "Using the MILC 2+1 flavor asqtad quark action ensembles, we are calculating the form factors $f_0$ and $f_+$ for the semileptonic $B_s \\rightarrow K \\ellν$ decay. A total of six ensembles with lattice spacing from $\\approx0.12$ to 0.06 fm are being used. At the coarsest and finest lattice spacings, the light quark mass $m'_l$ is one-tenth the strange quark mass $m'_s$. At the intermediate lattice spacing, the ratio $m'_l/m'_s$ ranges from 0.05 to 0.2. The valence $b$ quark is treated using the Sheikholeslami-Wohlert Wilson-clover action with the Fermilab interpretation. The other valence quarks use the asqtad action. When combined with (future) measurements from the LHCb and Belle II experiments, these calculations will provide an alternate determination of the CKM matrix element $|V_{ub}|$.",

      "summary": "In the framework of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), parton distribution functions (PDFs) quantify how the momentum and spin of a hadron are divided among its quark and gluon constituents. Two main approaches exist to determine PDFs. The first approach, based on QCD factorization theorems, realizes a QCD analysis of a suitable set of hard-scattering measurements, often using a variety of hadronic observables. The second approach, based on first-principle operator definitions of PDFs, uses lattice QCD to compute directly some PDF-related quantities, such as their moments. Motivated by recent progress in both approaches, in this document we present an overview of lattice-QCD and global-analysis techniques used to determine unpolarized and polarized proton PDFs and their moments. We provide benchmark numbers to validate present and future lattice-QCD calculations and we illustrate how they could be used to reduce the PDF uncertainties in current unpolarized and polarized global analyses. This document represents a first step towards establishing a common language between the two communities, to foster dialogue and to further improve our knowledge of PDFs.",

Our model is asymptotically free, contains massive fermions that mimic a baryon and light bosons that mimic pions. Hence it is a useful toy model for QCD, especially since it too suffers from a sign problem in the auxiliary field formulation in the presence of a fermion chemical potential. In this work we formulate the model in both the world line and fermion-bag representations and show that the sign problem can be completely eliminated with open boundary conditions when the fermions are massless. Hence we are able accurately compute a variety of interesting quantities in the model, and these results could provide benchmarks for other methods that are being developed to solve the sign problem in QCD.",

Since the definition of quasi-distributions is not unique, each choice goes along with a specific matching function, we can use this freedom to optimize convergence towards the large-momentum limit. As an illustration, we study quasi-distributions with a Gaussian weighting factor that naturally suppresses long-range correlations, which are plagued by artifacts. This choice has the advantage that the matching functions can be trivially obtained from the known ones. We apply the Gaussian weighting to the previously published results for the nonperturbatively renormalized unpolarized quark distribution, and find that the unphysical oscillatory behavior is significantly reduced.",

We use a mixed action approach based on the gradient flow to control lattice artifacts, allowing a simultaneous extrapolation to the chiral and continuum limits. We find strong evidence that the pseudoscalar is a Goldstone boson state, with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry and a non-zero Goldstone decay constant in the chiral limit. In agreement with our study of the gauge coupling $β$ function, we find the sextet model appears to be a near-conformal gauge theory and serves as a prototype of the composite Higgs BSM template.",

      "summary": "The QCD equation of state at zero baryon chemical potential is the only element of the standard dynamical framework to describe heavy ion collisions that can be directly determined from first principles. Continuum extrapolated lattice QCD equations of state have been computed using 2+1 quark flavors (up/down and strange) as well as 2+1+1 flavors to investigate the effect of thermalized charm quarks on QCD thermodynamics. Lattice results have also indicated the presence of new strange resonances that not only contribute to the equation of state of QCD matter but also affect hadronic afterburners used to model the later stages of heavy ion collisions. We investigate how these new developments obtained from first principles calculations affect multiparticle correlations in heavy ion collisions. We compare the commonly used equation of state S95n-v1, which was constructed using what are now considered outdated lattice results and hadron states, to the current state-of-the-art lattice QCD equations of state with 2+1 and 2+1+1 flavors coupled to the most up-to-date hadronic resonances and their decays. New hadronic resonances lead to an enhancement in the hadronic spectra at intermediate $p_T$. Using an outdated equation of state can directly affect the extraction of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, $η/s$, of the quark-gluon plasma and results for different flow observables. The effects of the QCD equation of state on multiparticle correlations of identified particles are determined for both AuAu $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV and PbPb $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV collisions. New insights into the $v_2\\{2\\}$ to $v_3\\{2\\}$ puzzle in ultracentral collisions are found. Flow observables of heavier particles exhibit more non-linear behavior regardless of the assumptions about the equation of state, which may provide a new way to constrain the temperature dependence of $η/s$.",

Our strategy is to complexify the Donaldson-Witten twist of four-dimensional N=2 super-Yang-Mills to make it amenable to a lattice formulation and we find that lattice gauge invariance forces the model to live in at most three dimensions.

      "summary": "We discuss practical methods to ensure near wirespeed performance from clusters with either one or two Intel(R) Omni-Path host fabric interfaces (HFI) per node, and Intel(R) Xeon Phi(TM) 72xx (Knight's Landing) processors, and using the Linux operating system.\n  The study evaluates the performance improvements achievable and the required programming approaches in two distinct example problems: firstly in Cartesian communicator halo exchange problems, appropriate for structured grid PDE solvers that arise in quantum chromodynamics simulations of particle physics, and secondly in gradient reduction appropriate to synchronous stochastic gradient descent for machine learning. As an example, we accelerate a published Baidu Research reduction code and obtain a factor of ten speedup over the original code using the techniques discussed in this paper. This displays how a factor of ten speedup in strongly scaled distributed machine learning could be achieved when synchronous stochastic gradient descent is massively parallelised with a fixed mini-batch size.\n  We find a significant improvement in performance robustness when memory is obtained using carefully allocated 2MB \"huge\" virtual memory pages, implying that either non-standard allocation routines should be used for communication buffers. These can be accessed via a LD\\_PRELOAD override in the manner suggested by libhugetlbfs. We make use of a the Intel(R) MPI 2019 library \"Technology Preview\" and underlying software to enable thread concurrency throughout the communication software stake via multiple PSM2 endpoints per process and use of multiple independent MPI communicators. When using a single MPI process per node, we find that this greatly accelerates delivered bandwidth in many core Intel(R) Xeon Phi processors.",

This complements alternative measurements of the beta function working directly at zero fermion mass and bridges the gap between the weak coupling perturbative regime and the strong coupling regime relevant to the mass spectrum of the theory. We apply this method to ${\\mathrm {SU(3)} }$ gauge theory with two fermion flavors in the 2-index symmetric (sextet) representation. We find that the beta function is small but non-zero at the renormalized coupling value $g^2 = 6.7$, consistent with our previous independent investigation using simulations directly at zero fermion mass. The model continues to be a very interesting explicit realization of the near-conformal composite Higgs paradigm which could be relevant for Beyond Standard Model phenomenology.",

We discuss the dependences of chiral condensates and susceptibilities, the Polyakov loop on the magnetic field and quark mass in three degenerate flavor QCD. The lattice simulations are performed using standard staggered fermions and the plaquette action with spatial sizes Ns = 16 and 24 and a fixed temporal size Nt = 4. The value of the quark masses are chosen such that the system undergoes a first order chiral phase transition and crossover with zero magnetic field. We find that in light mass regime, the quark chiral condensate undergoes magnetic catalysis in the whole temperature region and the phase transition tend to become stronger as the magnetic field increases. In crossover regime, deconfinement transition temperature is shifted by the magnetic field when quark mass ma is less than 0.4. The lattice cutoff effects are also discussed.",

While progress has been made in the past year in pursuing calculations with physical quark masses, studies of the simplest nuclear matrix elements and nuclear reactions at heavier quark masses have been conducted, and several interesting results have been obtained. A community effort has been devoted to investigate the impact of such Quantum Chromodynamics input on the nuclear many-body calculations. Systems involving hyperons and their interactions have been the focus of intense investigations in the field, with new results and deeper insights emerging. While the validity of some of the previous multi-nucleon studies has been questioned during the past year, controversy remains as whether such concerns are relevant to a given result.

In the scalar channel, we identify the ground state obtained through gluonic operators to be a single-particle state through its dispersion relation. When $q\\bar{q}$ operator is included, we find the mass of this state does not change, and the $q\\bar{q}$ operator couples very weakly to this state. So this state is most likely a glueball state. For pseudoscalars, along with the exiting lattice results, our study implies that both the conventional $q\\bar{q}$ state $η_2$ (or $η'$ in flavor $SU(3)$) and a heavier glueball-like state with a mass of roughly 2.6 GeV exist in the spectrum of lattice QCD with dynamical quarks.",

      "summary": "The theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) encodes the strong interactions that bind quarks and gluons into nucleons and that bind nucleons into nuclei. Predictive control of QCD would allow nuclear structure and reactions as well as properties of supernovae and neutron stars to be theoretically studied from first principles. Lattice QCD can represent generic QCD predictions in terms of well-defined path integrals, but the sign and signal-to-noise problems have obstructed lattice QCD calculations of large nuclei and nuclear matter in practice. This thesis presents a statistical study of lattice QCD correlation functions, with a particular focus on characterizing the structure of the noise associated with quantum fluctuations. The signal-to-noise problem in baryon correlation functions is demonstrated to arise from a sign problem associated with Monte Carlo sampling of complex correlation functions. The phases of complex correlation functions are analyzed in the framework of circular statistics, and the time evolution of the phase is shown to resemble a heavy-tailed random walk on the unit circle. Building on these observations, a new technique called phase reweighting is investigated that involves calculations of phase differences over fixed-length time intervals. Phase reweighting allows results for hadronic observables to be extracted from large-time correlation functions with constant signal-to-noise ratios. The signal-to-noise problem re-emerges as the length of the phase-difference interval is increased. Applications of phase reweighting to meson, baryon, and two-baryon systems are discussed.",

      "summary": "Nonperturbative lattice field theory simulations provide a systematic framework to investigate properties of conformal systems at strong couplings. These simulations can be performed using different lattice discretizations. Here we present numerical results for the step scaling beta function in SU(3) gauge theories with ten and twelve fundamental flavors. We calculate the renormalized $β$ function in the finite volume gradient flow renormalization scheme. Using Möbius domain wall fermions with Symanzik gauge action, Zeuthen gradient flow, and perturbative tree-level improvement, we implement a fully $O(a^2)$ Symanzik improved set-up and demonstrate its advantages. We compare our findings to existing results in the literature. For the ten flavor system we observe excellent agreement with the domain wall step-scaling function calculated by Chiu for the range in $g_c^2$ where our data overlap. In the case of the twelve flavor system, our $O(a^2)$ Symanzik improved set-up predicts a conformal infrared fixed point around $g_c^2 \\sim 5.5$ in the $c=0.25$ scheme, which is presently in tension with staggered fermion results in the literature. We consider possible reasons for the discrepancy.",

However, they suffer from a signal-to-noise problem where Monte Carlo estimates of observables have quantum fluctuations that are exponentially larger than their average values. Recent lattice QCD results demonstrate that the complex phase of baryon correlations functions relates the baryon signal-to-noise problem to a sign problem and exhibits unexpected statistical behavior resembling a heavy-tailed random walk on the unit circle. Estimators based on differences of correlation function phases evaluated at different Euclidean times are discussed that avoid the usual signal-to-noise problem, instead facing a signal-to-noise problem as the time interval associated with the phase difference is increased, and allow hadronic observables to be determined from arbitrarily large-time correlation functions.",

The contributions to the nucleon tensor charge from $u$ and $d$ quarks are found to be $δu = 0.3(2)$ and $δd = -0.7(2)$ at a scale $Q^2 = 2$ GeV$^2$.",

Our analysis includes 15 MILC asqtad ensembles with $N_f=2+1$ flavors of sea quarks and lattice spacings ranging from $a\\approx 0.15$ fm down to $0.045$ fm. The valence light quarks employ the asqtad action, whereas the heavy quarks are treated using the Fermilab action. We conclude with a discussion of future plans and phenomenological implications. When combined with experimental measurements of the decay rate, our calculation will enable a determination of the CKM matrix element $|V_{cb}|$.",

      "summary": "Lattice quantum chromodynamics simulations in nuclear physics have benefited from a tremendous number of algorithmic advances such as multigrid and eigenvector deflation. These improve the time to solution but do not alleviate the intrinsic memory-bandwidth constraints of the matrix-vector operation dominating iterative solvers. Batching this operation for multiple vectors and exploiting cache and register blocking can yield a super-linear speed up. Block-Krylov solvers can naturally take advantage of such batched matrix-vector operations, further reducing the iterations to solution by sharing the Krylov space between solves. However, practical implementations typically suffer from the quadratic scaling in the number of vector-vector operations. Using the QUDA library, we present an implementation of a block-CG solver on NVIDIA GPUs which reduces the memory-bandwidth complexity of vector-vector operations from quadratic to linear. We present results for the HISQ discretization, showing a 5x speedup compared to highly-optimized independent Krylov solves on NVIDIA's SaturnV cluster.",

We calculate topological charges with the standard cooling method and find that they become more reliable with increasing $β$ values and lattice sizes. Continuum limit estimates of the topological susceptibility $χ$ are obtained of which we favor $χ^{1/4}/T_c=0.643\\,(12)$, where $T_c$ is the SU(2) deconfinement temperature.

The range of the renormalized gauge coupling is extended from our earlier work {Fodor:2016zil} to probe the existence of an infrared fixed point (IRFP) in the $β$-function reported at two different locations, originally in {Cheng:2014jba} and at a new location in {Hasenfratz:2016dou}. We find no evidence for the IRFP of the $β$-function in the extended range of the renormalized gauge coupling, in disagreement with {Cheng:2014jba,Hasenfratz:2016dou}. New arguments to guard the existence of the IRFP remain unconvincing {Hasenfratz:2017mdh}, including recent claims of an IRFP with ten massless fermion flavors {Chiu:2016uui,Chiu:2017kza} which we also rule out. Predictions of the recently completed 5-loop QCD $β$-function for general flavor number are discussed in this context.",

      "summary": "We present our study on the thermal modifications of charmonia and bottomonia from spatial correlation functions at zero and nonzero momenta in quenched QCD. To accommodate the heavy quarks on the lattice we performed simulations on very fine lattices at a fixed beta value corresponding to a lattice spacing $a^{-1}=22.8$ GeV on $192^3\\times32$, $192^3\\times48$, $192^3\\times56$, $192^3\\times64$ and $192^3\\times96$ lattices using clover-improved Wilson fermions. These lattices correspond to temperatures of $2.25 T_c$, $1.50 T_c$, $1.25 T_c$, $1.10 T_c$ and $0.75 T_c$. To increase the signal to noise ratio in the axial-vector and scalar channels we used multi-sources for the measurement of spatial correlation functions. By investigating on the differences between spatial and temporal correlators as well as the temperature dependence of screening masses we will discuss the thermal effects in different channels of quarkonium states. Besides this the dispersion relation of the screening mass at different momenta is also discussed.",

      "summary": "We simulate lattice QCD at finite quark-number chemical potential to study nuclear matter, using the complex Langevin equation (CLE). The CLE is used because the fermion determinant is complex so that standard methods relying on importance sampling fail. Adaptive methods and gauge-cooling are used to prevent runaway solutions. Even then, the CLE is not guaranteed to give correct results. We are therefore performing extensive testing to determine under what, if any, conditions we can achieve reliable results. Our earlier simulations at $β=6/g^2=5.6$, $m=0.025$ on a $12^4$ lattice reproduced the expected phase structure but failed in the details. Our current simulations at $β=5.7$ on a $16^4$ lattice fail in similar ways while showing some improvement. We are therefore moving to even weaker couplings to see if the CLE might produce the correct results in the continuum (weak-coupling) limit, or, if it still fails, whether it might reproduce the results of the phase-quenched theory. We also discuss action (and other dynamics) modifications which might improve the performance of the CLE.",

At temperatures above $T_c$ we observe an approximate degeneracy of the correlators in these channels, which is unexpected because some of them are not related under $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$ nor $U(1)_A$ symmetries.

      "summary": "Measurements and theoretical calculations of meson form factors are essential for our understanding of internal hadron structure and QCD, the dynamics that bind the quarks in hadrons. The pion electromagnetic form factor has been measured at small space-like momentum transfer $|q^2| < 0.3$~GeV$^2$ by pion scattering from atomic electrons and at values up to $2.5$~GeV$^2$ by scattering electrons from the pion cloud around a proton. On the other hand, in the limit of very large (or infinite) $Q^2=-q^2$, perturbation theory is applicable. This leaves a gap in the intermediate $Q^2$ where the form factors are not known.\n  As a part of their 12 GeV upgrade Jefferson Lab will measure pion and kaon form factors in this intermediate region, up to $Q^2$ of $6$~GeV$^2$. This is then an ideal opportunity for lattice QCD to make an accurate prediction ahead of the experimental results. Lattice QCD provides a from-first-principles approach to calculate form factors, and the challenge here is to control the statistical and systematic uncertainties as errors grow when going to higher $Q^2$ values.\n  Here we report on a calculation that tests the method using an $η_s$ meson, a 'heavy pion' made of strange quarks, and also present preliminary results for kaon and pion form factors. We use the $n_f=2+1+1$ ensembles made by the MILC collaboration and Highly Improved Staggered Quarks, which allows us to obtain high statistics. The HISQ action is also designed to have small discretisation errors. Using several light quark masses and lattice spacings allows us to control the chiral and continuum extrapolation and keep systematic errors in check.",

This form factor parameterises the deviations from the behaviour of a point-like particle when a photon hits the pion. These deviations result from the internal structure of the pion and can thus be calculated in QCD. We use three sets (different lattice spacings) of $n_f = 2+1+1$ lattice configurations generated by the MILC collaboration. The Highly Improved Staggered Quark formalism (HISQ) is used for all of the sea and valence quarks. Using lattice configurations with $u$/$d$ quark masses very close to the physical value is a big advantage, as we avoid the chiral extrapolation. We study the shape of the vector ($f_+$) form factor in the $q^2$ range from $0$ to $-0.15$~GeV$^2$ and extract the mean square radius, $\\langle r^2_v\\rangle$. The shape of the vector form factor and the resulting radius is compared with experiment. We also discuss the scalar form factor and radius extracted from that, which is not directly accessible to experiment. We have also calculated the contributions from the disconnected diagrams to the scalar form factor at small $q^2$ and discuss their impact on the scalar radius $\\langle r^2_s\\rangle$.",

In order to contrast these many-flavors strongly interacting theories with QCD, we study the flavor-singlet spectrum as an interesting probe. In fact, some composite Higgs models require the Higgs boson to be the lightest flavor-singlet scalar in the spectrum of a strongly interacting new sector with a well defined hierarchy with the rest of the states. Moreover, introducing many light flavors at fixed number of colors can influence the dynamics of the lightest flavor-singlet pseudoscalar. We present the on-going study of these flavor-singlet channels using multiple interpolating operators on high-statistics ensembles generated by the LatKMI collaboration and we compare results with available data obtained by the Lattice Strong Dynamics collaboration. For the theory with 8 flavors, the two collaborations have generated configurations that complement each others with the aim to tackle the massless limit using the largest possible volumes.",

Quasi distributions are defined by matrix elements of a Wilson-line operator extended in a spatial direction, evaluated between nucleon states at finite momentum. We propose smearing this extended operator with the gradient flow to render the corresponding matrix elements finite in the continuum limit. This procedure provides a nonperturbative method to remove the power-divergence associated with the Wilson line and the resulting matrix elements can be directly matched to light-front distributions via perturbation theory.",

      "title": "Calm Multi-Baryon Operators",
      "summary": "Outstanding problems in nuclear physics require input and guidance from lattice QCD calculations of few baryons systems. However, these calculations suffer from an exponentially bad signal-to-noise problem which has prevented a controlled extrapolation to the physical point. The variational method has been applied very successfully to two-meson systems, allowing for the extraction of the two-meson states very early in Euclidean time through the use of improved single hadron operators. The sheer numerical cost of using the same techniques in two-baryon systems has been prohibitive. We present an alternate strategy which offers some of the same advantages as the variational method while being significantly less numerically expensive. We first use the Matrix Prony method to form an optimal linear combination of single baryon interpolating fields generated from the same source and different sink interpolators. Very early in Euclidean time this linear combination is numerically free of excited state contamination, so we coin it a calm baryon. This calm baryon operator is then used in the construction of the two-baryon correlation functions.\n  To test this method, we perform calculations on the WM/JLab iso-clover gauge configurations at the SU(3) flavor symmetric point with mπ $\\sim$ 800 MeV --- the same configurations we have previously used for the calculation of two-nucleon correlation functions. We observe the calm baryon removes the excited state contamination from the two-nucleon correlation function to as early a time as the single-nucleon is improved, provided non-local (displaced nucleon) sources are used. For the local two-nucleon correlation function (where both nucleons are created from the same space-time location) there is still improvement, but there is significant excited state contamination in the region the single calm baryon displays no excited state contamination.",

      "summary": "Quasi and pseudo distributions provide a new approach to determining parton distribution functions (PDFs) from first principles' calculations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Here I calculate the flavor nonsinglet unpolarized quasi distribution at one loop in perturbation theory, using the gradient flow to remove ultraviolet divergences. I demonstrate that, as expected, the gradient flow does not change the infrared structure of the quasi distribution at one loop and use the results to match the smeared matrix elements to those in the $\\ms$ scheme. This matching calculation is required to relate numerical results obtained from nonperturbative lattice QCD computations to light-front PDFs extracted from global analyses of experimental data.",

Beyond the usual Polyakov loop diagnostics of confinement, we employ several Wilson flow phase diagnostics. The first, what we call the \"flow anisotropy\", is known in the literature: the deconfinement transition introduces anisotropy between the spatial and temporal directions, to which the flow is extremely sensitive. The second, the \"long flow time Polyakov loop,\" is related but novel. While we do not claim to fully understand this diagnostic, we have empirically found it to be useful as an unusually sharp diagnostic of phase.",

We use a full $S$-wave colour/spin basis for the $\\bar{b}\\bar{b}bb$ operators in the three $0^{++}$, $1^{+-}$ and $2^{++}$ channels. We employ four gluon field ensembles at multiple lattice spacing values ranging from $a = 0.06 - 0.12$ fm, all of which include $u$, $d$, $s$ and $c$ quarks in the sea, and one ensemble which has physical light-quark masses. Additionally, we perform novel exploratory work with the objective of highlighting any signal of a near threshold tetraquark, if it existed, by adding an auxiliary potential into the QCD interactions. With our results we find no evidence of a QCD bound tetraquark below the lowest non-interacting thresholds in the channels studied.",

      "summary": "A large separation of scales is frequently required by theories describing physics beyond the Standard Model. In mass-split models with some massless (light) and some heavy flavors, large scale separation arises by construction if the system is conformal in the ultraviolet but chirally broken in the infrared. Due to the presence of a conformal fixed point, such chirally broken systems show hyperscaling and have a highly constrained resonance spectrum that is significantly different from the QCD spectrum. We present numerical evidence for hyperscaling of both light-light and heavy-heavy meson resonances and show that they only depend on the ratio of the light and heavy flavor masses. The heavy-heavy spectrum is qualitatively different from QCD. The mass of heavy-heavy quarkonia e.g. is not proportional to the constituent quark mass.",

The effective-field-theory framework has allowed us to identify and parameterize short- and long-range contributions previously missed in the literature. These contributions can not be absorbed into parameterizations of the single nucleon form factors. Starting from the quark and gluon level, we perform the matching onto chiral effective field theory and subsequently onto the nuclear potential. To derive the nuclear potential mediating neutrinoless double beta-decay, the hard, soft and potential neutrino modes must be integrated out. This is performed through next-to-next-to-leading order in the chiral power counting, in both the Weinberg and pionless schemes. At next-to-next-to-leading order, the amplitude receives additional contributions from the exchange of ultrasoft neutrinos, which can be expressed in terms of nuclear matrix elements of the weak current and excitation energies of the intermediate nucleus. These quantities also control the two-neutrino double beta-decay amplitude. Finally, we outline strategies to determine the low-energy constants that appear in the potentials, by relating them to electromagnetic couplings and/or by matching to lattice QCD calculations.",

      "summary": "Using symmetry properties, we determine the mixing pattern of a class of nonlocal quark bilinear operators containing a straight Wilson line along a spatial direction. We confirm the previous study that mixing among the lowest dimensional operators, which have mass dimension equals three, can occur if chiral symmetry is broken in the lattice action. For higher dimensional operators, we find that the dimension three operators will always mix with dimension four operators even if chiral symmetry is preserved. Also, the number of dimension four operators involved in the mixing is large hence it is impractical to remove the mixing by the improvement procedure. Our result is important to determining the Bjorken-$x$ dependence parton distribution functions using the quasi-distribution method on a Euclidean lattice. The requirement of using large hadron momentum in this approach makes the control of errors from dimension four operators even more important.",

Interesting aspects of the theory are discussed, distinguishing such states from baryonic matter. A major motivation of this study is the tetraquark states discovered by the Belle and other collaborations and the possibility that stable multi-quark families of such states exist. Similar to our previous baryonic study, we use a two-inequivalent wave function approach to investigate aspects of multi-quark matter. We think of our model as a tool for quickly assessing the characteristics of new, possibly bound, particle states of higher quark number content, which can not yet be examined by lattice methods.",

      "summary": "It is expected that when the number of light flavors of gauge theories is increased near or beyond some critical value, new and interesting behavior occurs. We discuss the qualitative properties of the RG flows for a local $SU(3)$ theory with $N_f$ light fundamental flavors for $N_f$ near 12. We discuss the realization of the chiral symmetry and remind that the Wigner mode seems an unlikely alternative. We propose to use a linear sigma model to describe the light $σ$ masses found in recent lattice calculations for $N_f$=8 and 12. Progress made after the conference are reported in arXiv:1709.09264, where it is claimed that the breaking of the axial $U(1)_A$ is a key ingredient to get a small $σ$ mass. For SU(3) lattice gauge theory with 12 flavors of unimproved staggered fermions, the scaling of the imaginary part of the zeros of the partition function in the complex coupling plane is consistent with a first order phase transition for small values of the mass. Zech Gelzer and Diego Floor are investigating the scaling near the endpoint of the line of first order phase transition in the mass-coupling plane where a light and weakly interacting scalar is expected. We briefly discuss recent calculations of the second-order Rényi entanglement entropy and estimations of the central charge using the Tensor Renormalization Group method for the two-dimensional O(2) model and the possibility to extend these calculations to higher dimensions.",

The model has a renormalizable $U(N_f)_L\\bigotimes U(N_f)_R$ invariant part, which has an approximate $O(2N_f^2)$ symmetry, and two additional terms, one describing the effects of a $SU(N_f)_V$ invariant mass term and the other the effects of the axial anomaly. We calculate the spectrum for arbitrary $N_f$. Using preliminary and published lattice results from the LatKMI collaboration, we found combinations of the masses that vary slowly with the explicit chiral symmetry breaking and $N_f$. This suggests that the anomaly term plays a leading role in the mass spectrum and that simple formulas such as $M_σ^2\\simeq (2/N_f-C_σ)M_{η'}^2$ should apply in the chiral limit. Lattice measurements of $M_{η'}^2$ and of approximate constants such as $C_σ$ could help locating the boundary of the conformal window. We show that our calculation can be adapted for arbitrary representations of the gauge group and in particular to the minimal model with two sextets, where similar patterns are likely to apply.",

      "summary": "A new method is proposed for determining the ground state wave function of a quantum many-body system on a quantum computer, without requiring an initial trial wave function that has good overlap with the true ground state. The technique of Spectral Combing involves entangling an arbitrary initial wave function with a set of auxiliary qubits governed by a time dependent Hamiltonian, resonantly transferring energy out of the initial state through a plethora of avoided level crossings into the auxiliary system. The number of avoided level crossings grows exponentially with the number of qubits required to represent the Hamiltonian, so that the efficiency of the algorithm does not rely on any particular energy gap being large. We give an explicit construction of the quantum gates required for the realization of this procedure and explore the results of classical simulations of the algorithm on a small quantum computer with up to 8 qubits. We show that for certain systems and comparable results, Spectral Combing requires fewer quantum gates to realize than the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm.",

At large N, holography predicts that this theory describes certain black hole solutions in Type IIA and IIB supergravity, and we use lattice gauge theory to test this. Unlike the one-dimensional quantum mechanics case where there is only the dimensionless temperature to vary, here we emphasize there are two more parameters which determine the shape of the flat torus. While a rectangular Euclidean torus yields a thermal interpretation, allowing for skewed tori modifies the holographic dual black hole predictions and results in another direction to test holography. Our lattice calculations are based on a supersymmetric formulation naturally adapted to a particular skewing. Using this we perform simulations up to N=16 with several lattice spacings for both skewed and rectangular tori. We observe the two expected black hole phases with their predicted behavior, with a transition between them that is consistent with the gravity prediction based on the Gregory--Laflamme transition.",

We use ensembles with dynamical light, strange and charm flavors of maximally twisted mass fermions. For both definitions of the susceptibility we employ ensembles at three values of the lattice spacing and several quark masses at each spacing. The data are fitted to chiral perturbation theory predictions with a discretization term to determine the continuum chiral condensate in the massless limit and estimate the overall discretization errors. We find that both approaches lead to compatible results in the continuum limit, but the gluonic ones are much more affected by cut-off effects. This finally yields a much smaller total error in the spectral projector results. We show that there exists, in principle, a value of the spectral cutoff which would completely eliminate discretization effects in the topological susceptibility.",

      "summary": "We report preliminary results on the finite temperature behavior of SU(4) gauge theory with dynamical quarks in both the fundamental and two-index antisymmetric representations. This system is a candidate to present scale separation behavior, where fermions in different representations condense at different temperature or coupling scales. Our simulations, however, reveal a single finite-temperature phase transition at which both representations deconfine and exhibit chiral restoration. It appears to be strongly first order. We compare our results to previous single-representation simulations. We also describe a Pisarski-Wilczek stability analysis, which suggests that the transition should be first order.",

      "summary": "Magnetic properties of octet baryons are investigated within the framework of chiral perturbation theory. Utilizing a power counting for large magnetic fields, the Landau levels of charged mesons are treated exactly giving rise to baryon energies that depend non-analytically on the strength of the magnetic field. In the small-field limit, baryon magnetic moments and polarizabilities emerge from the calculated energies. We argue that the magnetic polarizabilities of hyperons provide a testing ground for potentially large contributions from decuplet pole diagrams. In external magnetic fields, such contributions manifest themselves through decuplet-octet mixing, for which possible results are compared in a few scenarios. These scenarios can be tested with lattice QCD calculations of the octet baryon energies in magnetic fields.",

      "summary": "The quasi parton distribution is a spatial correlation of quarks or gluons along the $z$ direction in a moving nucleon which enables direct lattice calculations of parton distribution functions. It can be defined with a nonperturbative renormalization in a regularization independent momentum subtraction scheme (RI/MOM), which can then be perturbatively related to the collinear parton distribution in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme. Here we carry out a direct matching from the RI/MOM scheme for the quasi-PDF to the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ PDF, determining the non-singlet quark matching coefficient at next-to-leading order in perturbation theory. We find that the RI/MOM matching coefficient is insensitive to the ultraviolet region of convolution integral, exhibits improved perturbative convergence when converting between the quasi-PDF and PDF, and is consistent with a quasi-PDF that vanishes in the unphysical region as the proton momentum $P^z\\to \\infty$, unlike other schemes. This direct approach therefore has the potential to improve the accuracy for converting quasi-distribution lattice calculations to collinear distributions.",

We present a machine learning technique to bypass this problem. The central idea is to obtain a few field configurations via the flow equations to train a feed-forward neural network. The trained network defines a new manifold of integration which reduces the sign problem and can be rapidly sampled. We present results for the $1+1$ dimensional Thirring model with Wilson fermions on sizable lattices. In addition to the gain in speed, the parameterization of the integration manifold we use avoids the \"trapping\" of Monte Carlo chains which plagues large-flow calculations, a considerable shortcoming of the previous attempts.",

Although the computations are performed for relatively large values of the up and down quark masses, we gain new insight into the symmetries and relations between magnetic moments by working at a three-flavor mass-symmetric point. While the spin-flavor symmetry in the large Nc limit of QCD is shared by the naive constituent quark model, we find instances where quark model predictions are considerably favored over those emerging in the large Nc limit.

These constructions are demonstrated in lattice QCD calculations with light quarks corresponding to $m_π=$ 391 MeV. Using the distillation framework, correlation functions involving large bases of meson-meson and tetraquark operators are computed in the isospin-1 hidden-charm and doubly-charmed sectors, and finite-volume spectra are extracted with the variational method. We find the spectra are insensitive to the addition of tetraquark operators to the bases of meson-meson operators. For the first time, through using diverse bases of meson-meson operators, the multiple energy levels associated with meson-meson levels which would be degenerate in the non-interacting limit are extracted reliably. The number of energy levels in each spectrum is found to be equal to the number of expected non-interacting meson-meson levels in the energy region considered and the majority of energies lie close to the non-interacting levels. Therefore, there is no strong indication for any bound state or narrow resonance in the channels we study.",

      "summary": "The role of gluons in the structure of the nucleon and light nuclei is investigated using lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations. The first moment of the unpolarised gluon distribution is studied in nuclei up to atomic number $A=3$ at quark masses corresponding to pion masses of $m_π\\sim 450$ and $806$ MeV. Nuclear modification of this quantity defines a gluonic analogue of the EMC effect and is constrained to be less than $\\sim 10$% in these nuclei. This is consistent with expectations from phenomenological quark distributions and the momentum sum rule. In the deuteron, the combination of gluon distributions corresponding to the $b_1$ structure function is found to have a small first moment compared with the corresponding momentum fraction. The first moment of the gluon transversity structure function is also investigated in the spin-1 deuteron, where a non-zero signal is observed at $m_π\\sim 806$ MeV. This is the first indication of gluon contributions to nuclear structure that can not be associated with an individual nucleon.",

Of those, the cooling flow turns out to be computationally most efficient. We explore systematic errors due to use of three different energy observables and two distinct reference values for the flow time, the latter obtained by matching initial scaling behavior of some energy observables to that of the deconfining transition. Another important source of systematic errors are distinct fitting forms for the approach to the continuum limit. Besides relying in the conventional way on ratios of masses, we elaborate on a form introduced by Allton, which incorporates asymptotic scaling behavior. Ultimately we find that, though still small, our systematic errors are considerably larger than our statistical errors. ~",

We determine the structure of the low energy effective action for the auxiliary field needed to generate the four fermion term and find it has an novel structure that admits topologically non-trivial defects with non-zero Hopf invariant. We show that fermions propagating in such a background pick up a mass without breaking symmetries. Furthermore pairs of such defects experience a logarithmic interaction. We argue that a phase transition separates a phase where these defects proliferate from a broken phase where they are bound tightly. We conjecture that by tuning one additional operator the broken phase can be eliminated with a single BKT-like phase transition separating the massless from massive phases.",

In the $J^P=0^+$ sector we find analogues of the experimental $σ$ and $f_0(980)$ states, where the $σ$ appears as a stable bound-state below $ππ$ threshold, and, similar to what is seen in experiment, the $f_0(980)$ manifests itself as a dip in the $ππ$ cross section in the vicinity of the $K\\overline{K}$ threshold. For $J^P=2^+$ we find two states resembling the $f_2(1270)$ and $f_2'(1525)$, observed as narrow peaks, with the lighter state dominantly decaying to $ππ$ and the heavier state to $K\\overline{K}$. The presence of all these states is determined rigorously by finding the pole singularity content of scattering amplitudes, and their couplings to decay channels are established using the residues of the poles.",

The PDFs are obtained using the large-momentum effective field theory (LaMET) framework where the full Bjorken-$x$ dependence of finite-momentum PDFs, called \"quasi-PDFs\", can be calculated on the lattice. The quasi-PDF nucleon matrix elements are renormalized nonperturbatively in RI/MOM-scheme. However, the recent renormalized quasi-PDFs suffer from unphysical oscillations that alter the shape of the true distribution as a function of Bjorken-$x$. In this paper, we propose two possible solutions to overcome this problem, and demonstrate the efficacy of the methods on the 2+1+1-flavor lattice data at physical pion mass with lattice spacing 0.09~fm and volume $(5.76\\mbox{ fm})^3$.",

Using next-to-leading order Taylor expansions in baryon chemical potential we find that qualitative features of these ratios closely resemble the corresponding experimentally measured cumulants ratios of net proton-number fluctuations for beam energies down to $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} \\ge 19.6$ GeV. We show that the difference in cumulant ratios for the mean net baryon-number, $M_B/σ_B^2=χ_1^B(T,μ_B)/χ_2^B(T,μ_B)$ and the normalized skewness, $S_Bσ_B=χ_3^B(T,μ_B)/χ_2^B(T,μ_B)$, naturally arises in QCD thermodynamics. Moreover, we establish a close relation between skewness and kurtosis ratios, $S_Bσ_B^3/M_B=χ_3^B(T,μ_B)/χ_1^B(T,μ_B)$ and $κ_Bσ_B^2=χ_4^B(T,μ_B)/χ_2^B(T,μ_B)$, valid at small values of the baryon chemical potential.",

The Fourier coefficients of the imaginary part of the net-baryon density at imaginary baryochemical potential -- corresponding to the fugacity or virial expansion at real chemical potential -- are calculated within this model, and compared with the $N_t = 12$ lattice data. The lattice QCD behavior of the first four Fourier coefficients up to $T \\simeq 185$ MeV is described fairly well by an interacting HRG with a single baryon-baryon eigenvolume interaction parameter $b \\simeq 1$ fm$^3$, while the available lattice data on the difference $χ_2^B - χ_4^B$ of baryon number susceptibilities is reproduced up to $T \\simeq 175$ MeV.",

We measure conductivity of Dirac semimetals as a function of external magnetic field in parallel $σ_{\\parallel}$ and perpendicular $σ_{\\perp}$ to the external field directions. The simulations are carried out in three regimes: semimetal phase, onset of the insulator phase and deep in the insulator phase. In the semimetal phase $σ_{\\parallel}$ grows whereas $σ_{\\perp}$ drops with magnetic field. Similar behaviour was observed in the onset of the insulator phase but conductivity is smaller and its dependence on magnetic field is weaker. Finally in the insulator phase conductivities $σ_{\\parallel, \\perp}$ are close to zero and do not depend on magnetic field. In other words, we observe manifestation of the CME current in the semimetal phase, weaker manifestation of the CME in the onset of the insulator phase. We do not observe signatures of CME in the insulator phase. We believe that the suppression of the CME current in the insulator phase is connected to chiral symmetry breaking and generation of dynamical fermion mass which take place in this phase.",

Formulas and software for handling total spins up to $S=2$ and orbital angular momenta up to $L=6$ are obtained for total momenta in several directions. First tests involving $ρ$-meson decay to two pions include the $L=3$ and $L=5$ partial waves, and the contributions from these higher waves are found to be negligible in the elastic energy range.",

      "summary": "We study the effects of failure to equilibrate the squared topological charge $Q^2$ on lattice calculations of pseudoscalar masses and decay constants. The analysis is based on chiral perturbation theory calculations of the dependence of these quantities on the QCD vacuum angle $θ$. For the light-light partially quenched case, we rederive the known chiral perturbation theory results of Aoki and Fukaya, but using the nonperturbatively-valid chiral theory worked out by Golterman, Sharpe and Singleton, and by Sharpe and Shoresh. We then extend these calculations to heavy-light mesons. Results when staggered taste-violations are important are also presented. The derived $Q^2$ dependence is compared to that of simulations using the MILC collaboration's ensembles of lattices with four flavors of HISQ dynamical quarks. We find agreement, albeit with large statistical errors. These results can be used to correct for the leading effects of unequilibrated $Q^2$, or to make estimates of the systematic error coming from the failure to equilibrate $Q^2$. In an appendix, we show that the partially quenched chiral theory may be extended beyond a lower bound on valence masses discovered by Sharpe and Shoresh. Subtleties occurring when a sea-quark mass vanishes are discussed in another appendix.",

      "summary": "A relativistic formalism for relating the the energies of the states of three scalar particles in finite volume to infinite volume scattering amplitudes has recently been developed. This formalism has been used to predict the energy of the state closest to threshold in an expansion in powers of $1/L$, with $L$ the box length. This expansion has been tested previously by a perturbative calculation of the threshold energy in $λφ^4$ theory, working to third order in $λ$ and up to $\\mathcal O(1/L^6)$ in the volume expansion. However, several aspects of the predicted threshold behavior do not enter until fourth (three-loop) order in perturbation theory. Here I extend the perturbative calculation to fourth order and find agreement with the general prediction. This check also requires a two-loop calculation of the infinite-volume off-shell two-particle scattering amplitude near threshold. As a spin-off, I check the threshold expansion for two particles to the same order, finding agreement with the result that follows from Lüscher's formalism.",

      "summary": "Lattice quantum chromodynamics is used to constrain the interactions of two octet baryons at the SU(3) flavor-symmetric point, with quark masses that are heavier than those in nature (equal to that of the physical strange quark mass and corresponding to a pion mass of $\\approx 806~\\tt{MeV}$). Specifically, the S-wave scattering phase shifts of two-baryon systems at low energies are obtained with the application of Lüscher's formalism, mapping the energy eigenvalues of two interacting baryons in a finite volume to the two-particle scattering amplitudes below the relevant inelastic thresholds. The values of the leading-order low-energy scattering parameters in the irreducible representations of SU(3) are consistent with an approximate SU(6) spin-flavor symmetry in the nuclear and hypernuclear forces that is predicted in the large-$N_c$ limit of QCD. The two distinct SU(6)-invariant interactions between two baryons are constrained at this value of the quark masses, and their values indicate an approximate accidental SU(16) symmetry. The SU(3) irreducible representations containing the $NN~({^1}S_0)$, $NN~({^3}S_1)$ and $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(Ξ^0n+Ξ^-p)~({^3}S_1)$ channels unambiguously exhibit a single bound state, while the irreducible representation containing the $Σ^+ p~({^3}S_1)$ channel exhibits a state that is consistent with either a bound state or a scattering state close to threshold. These results are in agreement with the previous conclusions of the NPLQCD collaboration regarding the existence of two-nucleon bound states at this value of the quark masses.",

      "summary": "The vast majority of hadrons observed in nature are not stable under the strong interaction, rather they are resonances whose existence is deduced from enhancements in the energy dependence of scattering amplitudes. The study of hadron resonances offers a window into the workings of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in the low-energy non-perturbative region, and in addition, many probes of the limits of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model consider processes which feature hadron resonances. From a theoretical standpoint, this is a challenging field: the same dynamics that binds quarks and gluons into hadron resonances also controls their decay into lighter hadrons, so a complete approach to QCD is required. Presently, lattice QCD is the only available tool that provides the required non-perturbative evaluation of hadron observables. In this article, we review progress in the study of few-hadron reactions in which resonances and bound-states appear using lattice QCD techniques. We describe the leading approach which takes advantage of the periodic finite spatial volume used in lattice QCD calculations to extract scattering amplitudes from the discrete spectrum of QCD eigenstates in a box. We explain how from explicit lattice QCD calculations, one can rigorously garner information about a variety of resonance properties, including their masses, widths, decay couplings, and form factors. The challenges which currently limit the field are discussed along with the steps being taken to resolve them.",

The starting idea is to treat the generic equal-time matrix element ${\\cal M} (Pz_3, z_3^2)$ as a function of the Ioffe time $ν= Pz_3$ and the distance $z_3$. The next step is to divide ${\\cal M} (Pz_3, z_3^2)$ by the rest-frame density ${\\cal M} (0, z_3^2)$. Our lattice calculation shows a linear exponential $z_3$-dependence in the rest-frame function, expected from the $Z(z_3^2)$ factor generated by the gauge link. Still, we observe that the ratio ${\\cal M} (Pz_3 , z_3^2)/{\\cal M} (0, z_3^2)$ has a Gaussian-type behavior with respect to $z_3$ for 6 values of $P$ used in the calculation. This means that $Z(z_3^2)$ factor was canceled in the ratio. When plotted as a function of $ν$ and $z_3$, the data are very close to $z_3$-independent functions. This phenomenon corresponds to factorization of the $x$- and $k_\\perp$-dependence for the TMD ${\\cal F} (x, k_\\perp^2)$. For small $z_3 \\leq 4a$, the residual $z_3$-dependence is explained by perturbative evolution, with $α_s/π=0.1$.",

      "summary": "We perform the first quantitative study of the sensitivity of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis to variations in isospin breaking with precise input from lattice QCD calculations. The predicted light nuclear abundances are most sensitive to the neutron-proton mass splitting as both the initial relative abundance of neutrons to protons and the $n \\rightleftharpoons p$ weak reaction rates are very sensitive to this quantity. Lattice QCD has been used to determine this mass splitting to greater than 5-sigma, including contributions from both the down-quark up-quark mass splitting, $2δ= m_d-m_u$ and from electromagnetic coupling of the quarks to the photons with a strength governed by the fine structure constant, $α_{fs}$. At leading order in isospin breaking, the contribution of $δ$ and $α_{fs}$ to $M_n-M_p$ and the nuclear reaction rates can be varied independently. We use this knowledge and input from lattice QCD to quantitatively study variations of the predicted light nuclear abundances as $δ$ and $α_{fs}$ are varied. The change in the D and ${}^4$He abundances individually allow for potentially large simultaneous variations in $δ$ and $α_{fs}$ while maintaining consistency with the observed abundances, however the combined comparison restricts variations in these sources of isospin breaking to less than $\\lesssim1.25\\%$ at the 3-sigma confidence level. This sensitivity can be used to place tight constraints on prospective beyond the Standard Model theories that would modify these isospin breaking effects in the primordial Universe.",

      "summary": "We calculate in three-flavor lattice QCD the short-distance hadronic matrix elements of all five $ΔC=2$ four-fermion operators that contribute to neutral $D$-meson mixing both in and beyond the Standard Model. We use the MILC Collaboration's $N_f = 2+1$ lattice gauge-field configurations generated with asqtad-improved staggered sea quarks. We also employ the asqtad action for the valence light quarks and use the clover action with the Fermilab interpretation for the charm quark. We analyze a large set of ensembles with pions as light as $M_π\\approx 180$ MeV and lattice spacings as fine as $a\\approx 0.045$ fm, thereby enabling good control over the extrapolation to the physical pion mass and continuum limit. We obtain for the matrix elements in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$-NDR scheme using the choice of evanescent operators proposed by Beneke \\emph{et al.}, evaluated at 3 GeV, $\\langle D^0|\\mathcal{O}_i|\\bar{D}^0 \\rangle = \\{0.0805(55)(16), -0.1561(70)(31), 0.0464(31)(9), 0.2747(129)(55), 0.1035(71)(21)\\}~\\text{GeV}^4$ ($i=1$--5). The errors shown are from statistics and lattice systematics, and the omission of charmed sea quarks, respectively. To illustrate the utility of our matrix-element results, we place bounds on the scale of CP-violating new physics in $D^0$~mixing, finding lower limits of about 10--50$\\times 10^3$ TeV for couplings of $\\mathrm{O}(1)$. To enable our results to be employed in more sophisticated or model-specific phenomenological studies, we provide the correlations among our matrix-element results. For convenience, we also present numerical results in the other commonly-used scheme of Buras, Misiak, and Urban.",

      "summary": "Lattice QCD calculations of transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) in nucleons are presented, based on the evaluation of nucleon matrix elements of quark bilocal operators with a staple-shaped gauge connection. Both time-reversal odd effects, namely, the generalized Sivers and Boer-Mulders transverse momentum shifts, as well as time-reversal even effects, namely, the generalized transversity and one of the generalized worm-gear shifts are studied. Results are obtained on two different $n_f = 2+1$ flavor ensembles with approximately matching pion masses but very different discretization schemes: domain-wall fermions (DWF) with lattice spacing $a=0.084$ fm and pion mass 297 MeV, and Wilson-clover fermions with $a=0.114$ fm and pion mass 317 MeV. Comparison of the results on the two ensembles yields insight into the length scales at which lattice discretization errors are small, and into the extent to which the renormalization pattern obeyed by the continuum QCD TMD operator continues to apply in the lattice formulation. For the studied TMD observables, the results are found to be consistent between the two ensembles at sufficiently large separation of the quark fields within the operator, whereas deviations are observed in the local limit and in the case of a straight link gauge connection, which is relevant to the studies of parton distribution functions. Furthermore, the lattice estimates of the generalized Sivers shift obtained here are confronted with, and are seen to tend towards, a phenomenological estimate extracted from experimental data.",

The dependence of extra pole energies on the Möbius parameter $b-c$ and on the domain-wall height $M_5$ is investigated. Our result suggests that small values of $b-c$ set a large lower bound on the unphysical pole masses and the contribution of these poles could be suppressed well by calculating with small $b-c$.",

These cumulants provide a wealth of information on the properties of strong-interaction matter in the transition region from the low temperature hadronic phase to the quark-gluon plasma phase. They can be used to quantify deviations from hadron resonance gas (HRG) model calculations which frequently are used to determine thermal conditions realized in heavy ion collision experiments. Already some second order cumulants like the correlations between net baryon-number and net strangeness or net electric charge differ significantly at temperatures above 155 MeV in QCD and HRG model calculations. We show that these differences increase at non-zero baryon chemical potential constraining the applicability range of HRG model calculations to even smaller values of the temperature.",

A fundamental question in the theory of strong interactions, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), is whether a hot and dense system of quarks and gluons displays critical phenomena when doped with more quarks than antiquarks, where net-baryon number fluctuations diverge. Recent lattice QCD work indicates that such a critical point can only occur in the baryon dense regime of the theory, which defies a description from first principles calculations. Here we use the holographic gauge/gravity correspondence to map the fluctuations of baryon charge in the dense quark-gluon liquid onto a numerically tractable gravitational problem involving the charge fluctuations of holographic black holes. This approach quantitatively reproduces ab initio results for the lowest order moments of the baryon fluctuations and makes predictions for the higher order baryon susceptibilities and also for the location of the critical point, which is found to be within the reach of heavy ion collision experiments.",

      "summary": "In this work we present, for the first time, the non-perturbative renormalization for the unpolarized, helicity and transversity quasi-PDFs, in an RI' scheme. The proposed prescription addresses simultaneously all aspects of renormalization: logarithmic divergences, finite renormalization as well as the linear divergence which is present in the matrix elements of fermion operators with Wilson lines. Furthermore, for the case of the unpolarized quasi-PDFs, we describe how to eliminate the unwanted mixing with the twist-3 scalar operator. We utilize perturbation theory for the one-loop conversion factor that brings the renormalization functions to the MS-scheme at a scale of 2 GeV. We also explain how to improve the estimates on the renormalization functions by eliminating lattice artifacts. The latter can be computed in one-loop perturbation theory and to all orders in the lattice spacing. We apply the methodology for the renormalization to an ensemble of twisted mass fermions with Nf=2+1+1 dynamical light quarks, and a pion mass of around 375 MeV.",

Our calculations have been performed for Wilson/clover fermions and a wide class of Symanzik improved gluon actions. The extended nature of such long-link operators results in a nontrivial renormalization, including contributions which diverge linearly as well as logarithmically with the lattice spacing, along with additional finite factors. On the lattice there is also mixing among certain subsets of these nonlocal operators; we calculate the corresponding finite mixing coefficients, which are necessary in order to disentangle individual matrix elements for each operator from lattice simulation data. Finally, extending our perturbative setup, we present non-perturbative prescriptions to extract the linearly divergent contributions.",

The dependence of $C^f_J$ on the scale is weak with a tendency to be below the free field value at intermediate distances. Our numerical data suggests that the flavor-triplet fermion current and the topological current correlators become degenerate within numerical errors in the infra-red limit, thereby supporting an enhanced O(4) symmetry predicted by strong self-duality. Further, we demonstrate that fermion dynamics is necessary for the scale-invariant behavior of parity-invariant three-dimensional QED by showing that the pure gauge theory with non-compact gauge action has non-zero bilinear condensate.",

      "title": "Axial Vector Form Factors of the Nucleon from Lattice QCD",
      "summary": "We present results for the form factors of the isovector axial vector current in the nucleon state using large scale simulations of lattice QCD. The calculations were done using eight ensembles of gauge configurations generated by the MILC collaboration using the HISQ action with 2+1+1 dynamical flavors. These ensembles span three lattice spacings $a \\approx 0.06, 0.09$ and $0.12$ fm and light-quark masses corresponding to the pion masses $M_π\\approx 135, 225$ and $310$ MeV. High-statistics estimates allow us to quantify systematic uncertainties in the extraction of $G_A(Q^2)$ and the induced pseudoscalar form factor $\\tilde{G}_P(Q^2)$. We perform a simultaneous extrapolation in the lattice spacing, lattice volume and light-quark masses of the axial charge radius $r_A$ data to obtain physical estimates. Using the dipole ansatz to fit the $Q^2$ behavior we obtain $r_A|_{\\rm dipole} = 0.49(3)$ fm, which corresponds to ${\\cal M}_A = 1.39(9)$ GeV, and is consistent with ${\\cal M}_A = 1.35(17)$ GeV obtained by the miniBooNE collaboration. The estimate obtained using the $z$-expansion is $r_A|_{z-{\\rm expansion}} = 0.46(6)$ fm, and the combined result is $r_A|_{\\rm combined} = 0.48(4)$ fm. Analysis of the induced pseudoscalar form factor $\\tilde{G}_P(Q^2)$ yields low estimates for $g_P^\\ast$ and $g_{π{\\rm NN}}$ compared to their phenomenological values. To understand these, we analyze the partially conserved axial current (PCAC) relation by also calculating the pseudoscalar form factor. We find that these low values are due to large deviations in the PCAC relation between the three form factors and from the pion-pole dominance hypothesis.",

In addition, the disconnected insertion calculation of the three-point function and the calculation of the neutron electric dipole moment with the $θ$ term suffer from a noise problem due to the $\\sqrt{V}$ fluctuation. We identify these problems to have the same origin and the $\\sqrt{V}$ problem can be overcome by utilizing the cluster decomposition principle. We demonstrate this by considering the calculations of the glueball mass, the strangeness content in the nucleon, and the CP violation angle in the nucleon due to the $θ$ term. It is found that for lattices with physical sizes of 4.5 - 5.5 fm, the statistical errors of these quantities can be reduced by a factor of 3 to 4. The systematic errors can be estimated from the Akaike information criterion. For the strangeness content, we find that the systematic error is of the same size as that of the statistical one when the cluster decomposition principle is utilized. This results in a 2 to 3 times reduction in the overall error.",

We further show that the distance for a multimodal distribution gets dramatically reduced from a large value by the introduction of a tempering method.

      "summary": "We report a comprehensive analysis of the light and strange disconnected-sea quarks contribution to the nucleon magnetic moment, charge radius, and the electric and magnetic form factors. The lattice QCD calculation includes ensembles across several lattice volumes and lattice spacings with one of the ensembles at the physical pion mass. We adopt a model-independent extrapolation of the nucleon magnetic moment and the charge radius. We have performed a simultaneous chiral, infinite volume, and continuum extrapolation in a global fit to calculate results in the continuum limit. We find that the combined light and strange disconnected-sea quarks contribution to the nucleon magnetic moment is $μ_M\\,(\\text{DI})=-0.022(11)(09)\\,μ_N$ and to the nucleon mean square charge radius is $\\langle r^2\\rangle_E\\,\\text{(DI)}=-0.019(05)(05)$ fm$^2$ which is about $1/3$ of the difference between the $\\langle r_p^2\\rangle_E$ of electron-proton scattering and that of muonic atom and so cannot be ignored in obtaining the proton charge radius in the lattice QCD calculation. The most important outcome of this lattice QCD calculation is that while the combined light-sea and strange quarks contribution to the nucleon magnetic moment is small at about $1\\%$, a negative $2.5(9)\\%$ contribution to the proton mean square charge radius and a relatively larger positive $16.3(6.1)\\%$ contribution to the neutron mean square charge radius come from the sea quarks in the nucleon. For the first time, by performing global fits, we also give predictions of the light and strange disconnected-sea quarks contributions to the nucleon electric and magnetic form factors at the physical point and in the continuum and infinite volume limits in the momentum transfer range of $0\\leq Q^2\\leq 0.5$ GeV$^2$.",

      "summary": "We present an improved result of lattice computation of the proton decay matrix elements in $N_f=2+1$ QCD. In this study, the significant improvement of statistical accuracy by adopting the error reduction technique of All-mode-averaging, is achieved for relevant form factor to proton (and also neutron) decay on the gauge ensemble of $N_f=2+1$ domain-wall fermions in $m_π=0.34$--0.69 GeV on 2.7~fm$^3$ lattice as used in our previous work \\cite{Aoki:2013yxa}. We improve total accuracy of matrix elements to 10--15\\% from 30--40\\% for $p\\rightarrowπe^+$ or from 20--40\\% for $p\\rightarrow K \\barν$. The accuracy of the low energy constants $α$ and $β$ in the leading-order baryon chiral perturbation theory (BChPT) of proton decay are also improved. The relevant form factors of $p\\rightarrow π$ estimated through the \"direct\" lattice calculation from three-point function appear to be 1.4 times smaller than those from the \"indirect\" method using BChPT with $α$ and $β$. It turns out that the utilization of our result will provide a factor 2--3 larger proton partial lifetime than that obtained using BChPT. We also discuss the use of these parameters in a dark matter model.",

      "summary": "In our previous work, the connected and leading disconnected hadronic light-by-light contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g - 2) have been computed using lattice QCD ensembles corresponding to physical pion mass generated by the RBC/UKQCD collaboration. However, the calculation is expected to suffer from a significant finite volume error that scales like $1/L^2$ where $L$ is the spatial size of the lattice. In this paper, we demonstrate that this problem is cured by treating the muon and photons in infinite volume, continuum QED, resulting in a weighting function that is pre-computed and saved with affordable cost and sufficient accuracy. We present numerical results for the case when the quark loop is replaced by a muon loop, finding the expected exponential approach to the infinite volume limit and consistency with the known analytic result. We have implemented an improved weighting function which reduces both discretization and finite volume effects arising from the hadronic part of the amplitude.",

      "summary": "Path integrals describing quantum many-body systems can be calculated with Monte Carlo sampling techniques, but average quantities are often subject to signal-to-noise ratios that degrade exponentially with time. A phase-reweighting technique inspired by recent observations of random walk statistics in correlation functions is proposed that allows energy levels to be extracted from late-time correlation functions with time-independent signal-to-noise ratios. Phase reweighting effectively includes dynamical refinement of source magnitudes but introduces a bias associated with the phase. This bias can be removed by performing an extrapolation, but at the expense of re-introducing a signal-to-noise problem. Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics calculations of the $ρ$ and nucleon masses and of the $ΞΞ$ binding energy show consistency between standard results obtained using earlier-time correlation functions and phase-reweighted results using late-time correlation functions inaccessible to standard statistical analysis methods.",

Our calculation is performed with a pion mass of $m_π\\approx 320\\:\\:{\\rm MeV}$ and a lattice size of $L\\approx 3.6$ fm.

We perform an analysis using Lüscher's formalism for the energies below the inelastic thresholds, and investigate several phase shift models, including possible nonresonant contributions. We find that our data are well described by the minimal Breit-Wigner form, with no statistically significant nonresonant component. In determining the $ρ$ resonance mass and coupling we compare two different approaches: fitting the individually extracted phase shifts versus fitting the $t$-matrix model directly to the energy spectrum. We find that both methods give consistent results, and at a pion mass of $am_π=0.18295(36)_{stat}$ obtain $g_{ρππ} = 5.69(13)_{stat}(16)_{sys}$, $am_ρ= 0.4609(16)_{stat}(14)_{sys}$, and $am_ρ/am_{N} = 0.7476(38)_{stat}(23)_{sys} $, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is the systematic uncertainty due to the choice of fit ranges.",

      "summary": "Many measurements of quarkonium suppression at the LHC, e.g. the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ of $J/Ψ$, are well described by a multitude of different models. Thus pinpointing the underlying physics aspects is difficult and guidance based on first principles is needed. Here we present the current status of our ongoing high precision study of in-medium spectral properties of both bottomonium and charmonium based on NRQCD on the lattice. This effective field theory allows us to capture the physics of quarkonium without modeling assumptions in a thermal QCD medium. In our study a first principles and realistic description of the QCD medium is provided by state-of-the-art lattices of the HotQCD collaboration at almost physical pion mass. Our updated results corroborate a picture of sequential modification of states with respect to their vacuum binding energy. Using a novel low-gain variant of the Bayesian BR method for reconstructing spectral functions we find that remnant features of the Upsilon may survive up to $T\\sim400$MeV, while the $χ_b$ signal disappears around $T\\sim270$MeV. The $c\\bar{c}$ analysis hints at melting of $χ_c$ below $T\\sim190$MeV while some $J/Ψ$ remnant feature might survive up to $T\\sim245$MeV. An improved understanding of the numerical artifacts in the Bayesian approach and the availability of increased statistics have made possible a first quantitative study of the in-medium ground state masses, which tend to lower values as $T$ increases, consistent with lattice potential based studies.",

In the energy regions between $\\sqrt{s}_{NN}$=19.6 and 200 GeV, the susceptibility calculated at $T/T_c=0.93$ is consistent with experimental data at $0 \\le μ_B/T < 1.5$, while the kurtosis shows similar behavior with that of the experimental data in the small $μ_B/T$ regions $0 \\le μ_B/T < 0.3$. The experimental data at $\\sqrt{s}_{NN}=$ 11.5 shows quite different behavior. The lattice result in the deconfinement region,$T/T_c=1.35$, is far from experimental data.",

      "summary": "We report on a lattice QCD calculation of the nucleon axial charge, $g_A$, using Möbius Domain-Wall fermions solved on the dynamical $N_f=2+1+1$ HISQ ensembles after they are smeared using the gradient-flow algorithm. The calculation is performed with three pion masses, $m_π\\sim\\{310,220,130\\}$ MeV. Three lattice spacings ($a\\sim\\{0.15,0.12,0.09\\}$ fm) are used with the heaviest pion mass, while the coarsest two spacings are used on the middle pion mass and only the coarsest spacing is used with the near physical pion mass. On the $m_π\\sim220$ MeV, $a\\sim0.12$ fm point, a dedicated volume study is performed with $m_πL \\sim \\{3.22,4.29,5.36\\}$. Using a new strategy motivated by the Feynman-Hellmann Theorem, we achieve a precise determination of $g_A$ with relatively low statistics, and demonstrable control over the excited state, continuum, infinite volume and chiral extrapolation systematic uncertainties, the latter of which remains the dominant uncertainty. Our final determination at 2.6\\% total uncertainty is $g_A = 1.278(21)(26)$, with the first uncertainty including statistical and systematic uncertainties from fitting and the second including model selection systematics related to the chiral and continuum extrapolation. The largest reduction of the second uncertainty will come from a greater number of pion mass points as well as more precise lattice QCD results near the physical pion mass.",

We show that the Calabrese-Cardy conformal field theory predictions for the leading logarithmic scaling with the spatial size of these entropies are consistent with a central charge $c=1$. This scaling survives the time continuum limit and truncations of the microscopic degrees of freedom, modifications which allow us to connect the Lagrangian formulation to quantum Hamiltonians. At half-filling, the forms of the subleading corrections imposed by conformal field theory allow the determination of the central charge with an accuracy better than two percent for moderately sized lattices. We briefly discuss the possibility of estimating the central charge using quantum simulators.",

      "summary": "We present a lattice quantum chromodynamics determination of the scalar and vector form factors for the $B_s \\rightarrow D_s \\ell ν$ decay over the full physical range of momentum transfer. In conjunction with future experimental data, our results will provide a new method to extract $|V_{cb}|$, which may elucidate the current tension between exclusive and inclusive determinations of this parameter. Combining the form factor results at non-zero recoil with recent HPQCD results for the $B \\rightarrow D \\ell ν$ form factors, we determine the ratios $f^{B_s \\rightarrow D_s}_0(M_π^2) / f^{B \\rightarrow D}_0(M_K^2) = 1.000(62)$ and $f^{B_s \\rightarrow D_s}_0(M_π^2) / f^{B \\rightarrow D}_0(M_π^2) = 1.006(62)$. These results give the fragmentation fraction ratios $f_s/f_d = 0.310(30)_{\\mathrm{stat.}}(21)_{\\mathrm{syst.}}(6)_{\\mathrm{theor.}}(38)_{\\mathrm{latt.}} $ and $f_s/f_d = 0.307(16)_{\\mathrm{stat.}}(21)_{\\mathrm{syst.}}(23)_{\\mathrm{theor.}}(44)_{\\mathrm{latt.}}$, respectively. The fragmentation fraction ratio is an important ingredient in experimental determinations of $B_s$ meson branching fractions at hadron colliders, in particular for the rare decay ${\\cal B}(B_s \\rightarrow μ^+ μ^-)$. In addition to the form factor results, we make the first prediction of the branching fraction ratio $R(D_s) = {\\cal B}(B_s\\to D_sτν)/{\\cal B}(B_s\\to D_s\\ellν) = 0.301(6)$, where $\\ell$ is an electron or muon. Current experimental measurements of the corresponding ratio for the semileptonic decays of $B$ mesons disagree with Standard Model expectations at the level of nearly four standard deviations. Future experimental measurements of $R(D_s)$ may help understand this discrepancy.",

This work was done using a single ensemble with pion mass 317 MeV and made use of the hierarchical probing technique to efficiently evaluate the required disconnected loops. We perform nonperturbative renormalization of the axial current, including a nonperturbative treatment of the mixing between light and strange currents due to the singlet-nonsinglet difference caused by the axial anomaly. The form factor shapes are fit using the model-independent $z$ expansion. From $G_A^q(Q^2)$, we determine the quark contributions to the nucleon spin and axial radii. By extrapolating the isovector $G_P^{u-d}(Q^2)$, we obtain the induced pseudoscalar coupling relevant for ordinary muon capture and the pion-nucleon coupling constant. We find that the disconnected contributions to $G_P$ form factors are large, and give an interpretation based on the dominant influence of the pseudoscalar poles in these form factors.",

However, for quantities such as lightfront parton distribution functions (PDFs) and generalized parton distributions (GPDs), the restriction to Euclidean time prevents direct calculation of the desired observable. Recently, progress has been made in relating these quantities to matrix elements of spatially nonlocal, zero-time operators, referred to as quasidistributions. Even for these time-independent matrix elements, potential subtleties have been identified in the role of the Euclidean signature. In this work, we investigate the analytic behavior of spatially non-local correlation functions and demonstrate that the matrix elements obtained from Euclidean lattice QCD are identical to those obtained using the LSZ reduction formula in Minkowski space. After arguing the equivalence on general grounds, we also show that it holds in a perturbative calculation, where special care is needed to identify the lattice prediction. Finally we present a proof of the uniqueness of the matrix elements obtained from Minkowski and Euclidean correlation functions to all order in perturbation theory.",

One possible solution is to use the holomorphic gradient flow, a method we introduced related to the Lefschetz thimbles idea. In many cases the probability distribution generated by this method is multi-modal and standard Monte-Carlo sampling fails. We propose an algorithm that incorporates tempered proposals to solve this problem.

      "summary": "The lowest-lying glueballs are investigated in lattice QCD using $N_f=2$ clover Wilson fermion on anisotropic lattices. We simulate at two different and relatively heavy quark masses, corresponding to physical pion mass of $m_π\\sim 938$ MeV and $650$ MeV. The quark mass dependence of the glueball masses have not been investigated in the present study. Only the gluonic operators built from Wilson loops are utilized in calculating the corresponding correlation functions. In the tensor channel, we obtain the ground state mass to be 2.363(39) GeV and 2.384(67) GeV at $m_π\\sim 938$ MeV and $650$ MeV, respectively. In the pseudoscalar channel, when using the gluonic operator whose continuum limit has the form of $ε_{ijk}TrB_iD_jB_k$, we obtain the ground state mass to be 2.573(55) GeV and 2.585(65) GeV at the two pion masses. These results are compatible with the corresponding results in the quenched approximation. In contrast, if we use the topological charge density as field operators for the pseudoscalar, the masses of the lowest state are much lighter (around 1GeV) and compatible with the expected masses of the flavor singlet $q\\bar{q}$ meson. This indicates that the operator $ε_{ijk}TrB_iD_jB_k$ and the topological charge density couple rather differently to the glueball states and $q\\bar{q}$ mesons. The observation of the light flavor singlet pseudoscalar meson can be viewed as the manifestation of effects of dynamical quarks. In the scalar channel, the ground state masses extracted from the correlation functions of gluonic operators are determined to be around 1.4-1.5 GeV, which is close to the ground state masses from the correlation functions of the quark bilinear operators. In all cases, the mixing between glueballs and conventional mesons remains to be further clarified in the future.",

      "summary": "We report a lattice calculation of nucleon forward matrix elements on a $48^3 \\times 96$ lattice at the physical pion mass and a spatial size of 5.5 fm. The $2+1$ flavor dynamical fermion configurations are generated with domain-wall fermions (DWF) and the overlap fermions are adopted for the valence quarks. The isovector $g_A^3$ and $g_S^3$, and the connected insertion part of $g_S^0$ are reported for three source-sink separations. With local current, we obtain $g_A^3 = 1.18(4)$ from a two-state fit. For the quark momentum fraction $\\langle x \\rangle_{u-d}$, we have included smaller lattices (i.e. $24^3 \\times 64$ and $32^3 \\times 64$ lattice with pion mass at 330 and 290 MeV respectively) for a fit which includes partially quenched cases as well as finite volume and continuum corrections. A global fit with perturbative renormalization gives $\\langle x \\rangle_{u-d} (\\overline{MS},\\, μ= 2\\, {\\rm GeV}) = 0.170(14)$.\n  We made a cost comparison of calculating the nucleon matrix elements with those from the twisted mass fermion on similar sized lattice at the physical pion point and the domain-wall fermion calculation on the same DWF lattice. We also compare cost with the clover fermion calculation on similar sized lattice at about the same quark mass. The comparison shows that with several improvements, such as many-to-all correlator with grid source and low-mode substitution in the connected insertion and low-mode average in the quark loop can make the overlap as efficient as the twisted-mass and clover fermions in calculating the three-point functions. It is more efficient than the DWF. When the multi-mass feature is invoked, the overlap can be more efficient in reaching the same precision than the single mass comparison made so far.",

We provide the one-loop partially quenched chiral perturbation theory expressions both with and without including the effects of staggered quarks for all form factors at finite volume and with partially twisted boundary conditions for both the vector current and scalar density matrix elements at all $q^2$. We point out that at finite volume there are more form factors than just $f_+$ and $f_-$ for the vector current matrix element but that the Ward identity is fully satisfied. The size of the finite-volume corrections at present lattice sizes is small. This will help improve the lattice determination of $f_+(q^2=0)$ since the finite-volume error is the dominant error source for some calculations. The size of the finite-volume corrections may be estimated on a single lattice ensemble by comparing results for various twist choices.",

      "summary": "A lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) calculation of the nuclear matrix element relevant to the $nn\\to ppee\\overlineν_e\\overlineν_e$ transition is described in detail, expanding on the results presented in Ref. [1]. This matrix element, which involves two insertions of the weak axial current, is an important input for phenomenological determinations of double-$β$ decay rates of nuclei. From this exploratory study, performed using unphysical values of the quark masses, the long-distance deuteron-pole contribution to the matrix element is separated from shorter-distance hadronic contributions. This polarizability, which is only accessible in double-weak processes, cannot be constrained from single-$β$ decay of nuclei, and is found to be smaller than the long-distance contributions in this calculation, but non-negligible. In this work, technical aspects of the LQCD calculations, and of the relevant formalism in the pionless effective field theory, are described. Further calculations of the isotensor axial polarizability, in particular near and at the physical values of the light-quark masses, are required for precise determinations of both two-neutrino and neutrinoless double-$β$ decay rates in heavy nuclei.",

Motivated by recent lattice QCD + QED computations of electromagnetic masses employing this setup, we consider finite-volume effects arising from the use of larger-than-physical electric charges. A modified power-counting scheme, which is based on treating the fine-structure constant as larger than its physical value, is explored. Results for perturbative QED corrections, however, are surprising. Within the framework of non-relativistic QED, multi-loop diagrams exhibit a momentum factorization property that produces exact cancellations. We determine that power-law finite-volume effects vanish at the leading two- and three-loop order, as well as the next-to-leading two-loop order. For larger-than-physical charges, we consequently expect no appreciable volume corrections beyond leading-order QED.",

      "summary": "Fluctuations of conserved charges allow to study the chemical composition of hadronic matter. A comparison between lattice simulations and the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model suggested the existence of missing strange resonances. To clarify this issue we calculate the partial pressures of mesons and baryons with different strangeness quantum numbers using lattice simulations in the confined phase of QCD. In order to make this calculation feasible, we perform simulations at imaginary strangeness chemical potentials. We systematically study the effect of different hadronic spectra on thermodynamic observables in the HRG model and compare to lattice QCD results. We show that, for each hadronic sector, the well established states are not enough in order to have agreement with the lattice results. Additional states, either listed in the Particle Data Group booklet (PDG) but not well established, or predicted by the Quark Model (QM), are necessary in order to reproduce the lattice data. For mesons, it appears that the PDG and the quark model do not list enough strange mesons, or that, in this sector, interactions beyond those included in the HRG model are needed to reproduce the lattice QCD results.",

The mass corrections needed to extract the pion distribution amplitude from this approach are calculated to all orders in $m^2_π /P_z^2$. We also implement the Wilson- line renormalization which is crucial to remove the power divergences in this approach, and find that it reduces the oscillation at the end points of the distribution amplitude.

Using chirally symmetric domain wall fermions, we calculate the proton and the neutron EDFF induced by the CP-violating quark chromo-EDM interaction using the corrected expression. In addition, we calculate the electric dipole moment of the neutron using background electric field that respects time translation invariance and boundary conditions, and find that it decidedly agrees with the new formula but not the old formula for $F_3$. Finally, we analyze some selected lattice results for the nucleon EDM and observe that after the correction is applied, they either agree with zero or are substantially reduced in magnitude, thus reconciling their difference from phenomenological estimates of the nucleon EDM.",

      "summary": "We report on salient features of a mixed lattice QCD action using valence Möbius domain-wall fermions solved on the dynamical $N_f=2+1+1$ HISQ ensembles generated by the MILC Collaboration. The approximate chiral symmetry properties of the valence fermions are shown to be significantly improved by utilizing the gradient-flow scheme to first smear the HISQ configurations. The greater numerical cost of the Möbius domain-wall inversions is mitigated by the highly efficient QUDA library optimized for NVIDIA GPU accelerated compute nodes. We have created an interface to this optimized QUDA solver in Chroma. We provide tuned parameters of the action and performance of QUDA using ensembles with the lattice spacings $a \\simeq \\{0.15, 0.12, 0.09\\}$ fm and pion masses $m_π\\simeq \\{310, 220,130\\}$ MeV. We have additionally generated two new ensembles with $a\\sim0.12$ fm and $m_π\\sim\\{400, 350\\}$ MeV. With a fixed flow-time of $t_{gf}=1$ in lattice units, the residual chiral symmetry breaking of the valence fermions is kept below 10\\% of the light quark mass on all ensembles, $m_{res} \\lesssim 0.1\\times m_l$, with moderate values of the fifth dimension $L_5$ and a domain-wall height $M_5 \\leq 1.3$. As a benchmark calculation, we perform a continuum, infinite volume, physical pion and kaon mass extrapolation of $F_{K^\\pm}/F_{π^\\pm}$ and demonstrate our results are independent of flow-time, and consistent with the FLAG determination of this quantity at the level of less than one standard deviation.",

In this talk, we present results from two sets of calculations using clover fermions on 9 ensembles of 2+1+1-flavor HISQ and 4 ensembles of 2+1-flavor clover lattices. We show that high statistics can be obtained cost-effectively using the truncated solver method with bias correction and the coherent source sequential propagator technique. By performing simulations at 4--5 values of the source-sink separation $t_{\\rm sep}$, we demonstrate control over excited-state contamination using 2- and 3-state fits. Using the high-precision 2+1+1-flavor data, we perform a simultaneous fit in $a$, $M_π$ and $M_πL$ to obtain our final results for the charges.",

      "summary": "We calculated the QCD equation of state using Taylor expansions that include contributions from up to sixth order in the baryon, strangeness and electric charge chemical potentials. Calculations have been performed with the Highly Improved Staggered Quark action in the temperature range $T\\in [135~{\\rm MeV}, 330~{\\rm MeV}]$ using up to four different sets of lattice cut-offs corresponding to lattices of size $N_σ^3\\times N_τ$ with aspect ratio $N_σ/N_τ=4$ and $N_τ=6-16$. The strange quark mass is tuned to its physical value and we use two strange to light quark mass ratios $m_s/m_l=20$ and $27$, which in the continuum limit correspond to a pion mass of about $160$ MeV and $140$ MeV espectively. Sixth-order results for Taylor expansion coefficients are used to estimate truncation errors of the fourth-order expansion. We show that truncation errors are small for baryon chemical potentials less then twice the temperature ($μ_B\\le 2T$). The fourth-order equation of state thus is suitable for the modeling of dense matter created in heavy ion collisions with center-of-mass energies down to $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\sim 12$ GeV. We provide a parametrization of basic thermodynamic quantities that can be readily used in hydrodynamic simulation codes. The results on up to sixth order expansion coefficients of bulk thermodynamics are used for the calculation of lines of constant pressure, energy and entropy densities in the $T$-$μ_B$ plane and are compared with the crossover line for the QCD chiral transition as well as with experimental results on freeze-out parameters in heavy ion collisions. These coefficients also provide estimates for the location of a possible critical point. We argue that results on sixth order expansion coefficients disfavor the existence of a critical point in the QCD phase diagram for $μ_B/T\\le 2$ and $T/T_c(μ_B=0) > 0.9$.",

These matrix elements, combined with the bound on the neutron EDM, would provide stringent constraints on beyond the standard model physics, especially as the next generation of neutron EDM experiments reduce the current bound. We then present our lattice strategy for the calculation of these matrix elements, in particular we describe the use of the Schrödinger source method to reduce the calculation of the 4-point to 3-point functions needed to evaluate the quark chromo EDM contribution.

At the unphysical quark masses used in the numerical computation, these effects, encoded in the isotensor axial polarisability, are found to be of similar magnitude to the nuclear modification of the single axial current, which phenomenologically is the quenching of the axial charge used in nuclear many-body calculations. This finding suggests that nuclear models for neutrinoful and neutrinoless double-$β$ decays should incorporate this previously neglected contribution if they are to provide reliable guidance for next-generation neutrinoless double-$β$ decay searches. The prospects of constraining the isotensor axial polarisabilities of nuclei using lattice QCD input into nuclear many-body calculations are discussed.",

This is a second-order weak process involving two four-Fermi operators that is highly sensitive to new physics and being studied by the NA62 experiment at CERN. While much of this decay comes from perturbative, short-distance physics there is a long-distance part, perhaps as large as the planned experimental error, which involves nonperturbative phenomena. The calculation presented here, with unphysical quark masses, demonstrates that this contribution can be computed using lattice methods by overcoming three technical difficulties: (i) a short-distance divergence that results when the two weak operators approach each other, (ii) exponentially growing, unphysical terms that appear in Euclidean, second-order perturbation theory, and (iii) potentially large finite-volume effects. A follow-on calculation with physical quark masses and controlled systematic errors will be possible with the next generation of computers.",

      "title": "Quark orbital dynamics in the proton from Lattice QCD -- from Ji to Jaffe-Manohar orbital angular momentum",
      "summary": "Given a Wigner distribution simultaneously characterizing quark transverse positions and momenta in a proton, one can directly evaluate their cross-product, i.e., quark orbital angular momentum. The aforementioned distribution can be obtained by generalizing the proton matrix elements of quark bilocal operators which define transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs); the transverse momentum information is supplemented with transverse position information by introducing an additional nonzero momentum transfer. A gauge connection between the quarks must be specified in the quark bilocal operators; the staple-shaped gauge link path used in TMD calculations yields the Jaffe-Manohar definition of orbital angular momentum, whereas a straight path yields the Ji definition. An exploratory lattice calculation, performed at the pion mass m_pi = 518 MeV, is presented which quasi-continuously interpolates between the two definitions and demonstrates that their difference can be clearly resolved. The resulting Ji orbital angular momentum is confronted with traditional evaluations based on Ji's sum rule. Jaffe-Manohar orbital angular momentum is enhanced in magnitude compared to its Ji counterpart.",

      "title": "Simple chromatic properties of gradient flow",
      "summary": "It has become customary to use a smoothing algorithm called \"gradient flow\" to fix the lattice spacing in a simulation, through a parameter called $t_0$. It is shown that in order to keep the length $t_0$ fixed with respect to mesonic or gluonic observables as the number of colors $N_c$ is varied, the fiducial point for the flow parameter must be scaled nearly linearly in $N_c$. In simulations with dynamical fermions, the dependence of $t_0$ on the pseudoscalar meson mass flattens as the number of colors rises, in a way which is consistent with large $N_c$ expectations.",

      "title": "Heavy-quark meson spectrum tests of the Oktay-Kronfeld action",
      "summary": "The Oktay-Kronfeld (OK) action extends the Fermilab improvement program for massive Wilson fermions to higher order in suitable power-counting schemes. It includes dimension-six and -seven operators necessary for matching to QCD through order ${\\mathrm{O}}(Λ^3/m_Q^3)$ in HQET power counting, for applications to heavy-light systems, and ${\\mathrm{O}}(v^6)$ in NRQCD power counting, for applications to quarkonia. In the Symanzik power counting of lattice gauge theory near the continuum limit, the OK action includes all ${\\mathrm{O}}(a^2)$ and some ${\\mathrm{O}}(a^3)$ terms. To assess whether the theoretical improvement is realized in practice, we study combinations of heavy-strange and quarkonia masses and mass splittings, designed to isolate heavy-quark discretization effects. We find that, with one exception, the results obtained with the tree-level-matched OK action are significantly closer to the continuum limit than the results obtained with the Fermilab action. The exception is the hyperfine splitting of the bottom-strange system, for which our statistical errors are too large to draw a firm conclusion. These studies are carried out with data generated with the tadpole-improved Fermilab and OK actions on 500 gauge configurations from one of MILC's $a\\approx0.12$~fm, $N_f=2+1$-flavor, asqtad-staggered ensembles.",
