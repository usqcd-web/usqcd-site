      "title": "General quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation with applications to a non-Abelian lattice gauge theory",
      "summary": "With a focus on universal quantum computing for quantum simulation, and through the example of lattice gauge theories, we introduce rather general quantum algorithms that can efficiently simulate certain classes of interactions consisting of correlated changes in multiple (bosonic and fermionic) quantum numbers with non-trivial functional coefficients. In particular, we analyze diagonalization of Hamiltonian terms using a singular-value decomposition technique, and discuss how the achieved diagonal unitaries in the digitized time-evolution operator can be implemented. The lattice gauge theory studied is the SU(2) gauge theory in 1+1 dimensions coupled to one flavor of staggered fermions, for which a complete quantum-resource analysis within different computational models is presented. The algorithms are shown to be applicable to higher-dimensional theories as well as to other Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories. The example chosen further demonstrates the importance of adopting efficient theoretical formulations: it is shown that an explicitly gauge-invariant formulation using loop, string, and hadron degrees of freedom simplifies the algorithms and lowers the cost compared with the standard formulations based on angular-momentum as well as the Schwinger-boson degrees of freedom. The loop-string-hadron formulation further retains the non-Abelian gauge symmetry despite the inexactness of the digitized simulation, without the need for costly controlled operations. Such theoretical and algorithmic considerations are likely to be essential in quantumly simulating other complex theories of relevance to nature.",

Nonperturbative calculations of the radiative corrections can reduce the theory uncertainty in CKM matrix elements. Here we compute the electroweak box contribution to the pion and kaon $β$ decays using seven $N_f=2+1+1$ HISQ-Clover lattice with various pion mass and lattice spacing. The continuum and chiral limit is taken using the leading dependence on $M_π$ and $a$, where $M_π$ extrapolation is taken to the physical pion mass and $SU(3)$ symmetric mass for pion and kaon box contribution, respectively. Our results are $ \\square_{γW}^{VA} |_π = 2.820 (28) \\times 10^{-3} $ and $ \\square_{γW}^{VA} |_{K} = 2.384 (17) \\times 10^{-3} $.",

      "summary": "We present lattice-QCD calculations of the hadronic form factors for the semileptonic decays $D\\toπ\\ellν$, $D\\to K\\ellν$, and $D_s\\to K\\ellν$. Our calculation uses the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action for all valence and sea quarks and includes $N_f=2+1+1$ MILC ensembles with lattice spacings ranging from $a\\approx0.12$ fm down to $0.042$ fm. At most lattice spacings, an ensemble with physical-mass light quarks is included. The HISQ action allows all the quarks to be treated with the same relativistic light-quark action, allowing for nonperturbative renormalization using partial conservation of the vector current. We combine our results with experimental measurements of the differential decay rates to determine $|V_{cd}|^{D\\toπ}=0.2238(11)^{\\rm Expt}(15)^{\\rm QCD}(04)^{\\rm EW}(02)^{\\rm SIB}[22]^{\\rm QED}$ and $|V_{cs}|^{D\\to K}=0.9589(23)^{\\rm Expt}(40)^{\\rm QCD}(15)^{\\rm EW}(05)^{\\rm SIB}[95]^{\\rm QED}$ This result for $|V_{cd}|$ is the most precise to date, with a lattice-QCD error that is, for the first time for the semileptonic extraction, at the same level as the experimental error. Using recent measurements from BES III, we also give the first-ever determination of $|V_{cd}|^{D_s\\to K}=0.258(15)^{\\rm Expt}(01)^{\\rm QCD}[03]^{\\rm QED}$ from $D_s\\to K \\ellν$. Our results also furnish new Standard Model calculations of the lepton flavor universality ratios $R^{D\\toπ}=0.98671(17)^{\\rm QCD}[500]^{\\rm QED}$, $R^{D\\to K}=0.97606(16)^{\\rm QCD}[500]^{\\rm QED}$, and $R^{D_s\\to K}=0.98099(10)^{\\rm QCD}[500]^{\\rm QED}$, which are consistent within $2σ$ with experimental measurements. Our extractions of $|V_{cd}|$ and $|V_{cs}|$, when combined with a value for $|V_{cb}|$, provide the most precise test of second-row CKM unitarity, finding agreement with unitarity at the level of one standard deviation.",

      "summary": "We present a lattice QCD calculation of the unpolarized isovector quark parton distribution function (PDF) of the proton utilizing a perturbative matching at next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO). The calculations are carried out using a single ensemble of gauge configurations generated with $N_f = 2 + 1$ highly-improved staggered quarks with physical masses and a lattice spacing of $a = 0.076$ fm. We use one iteration of hypercubic smearing on these gauge configurations, and the resulting smeared configurations are then used for all aspects of the subsequent calculation. For the valence quarks, we use the Wilson-clover action with physical quark masses. We consider several methods for extracting information on the PDF. We first extract the lowest four Mellin moments using the leading-twist operator product expansion approximation. Then, we determine the $x$ dependence of the PDF through a deep neural network within the pseudo-PDF approach and additionally through the framework of large-momentum effective theory utilizing a hybrid renormalization scheme. This is the first application of the NNLO matching coefficients for the nucleon directly at the physical point.",

The advantage of this method is that: (1) The basis for the flow kernel can be chosen arbitrarily by hand. (2) It can be applied to the general action of interest. (3) The coefficients in the kernel are determined by lattice estimates of the observables, which does not require analytic calculations beforehand. We perform the HMC with the effective action obtained by the Schwinger-Dyson method, and show that we can have better control of the effective action than the known $t$-expansion construction. However, the algorithmic overhead is still large and overwhelming the gain though faster decorrelation is observed for long-range observables in some cases.

      "title": "50 Years of Quantum Chromodynamics",
      "summary": "This paper presents a comprehensive review of both the theory and experimental successes of Quantum Chromodynamics, starting with its emergence as a well defined theory in 1972-73 and following developments and results up to the present day. Topics include a review of the earliest theoretical and experimental foundations; the fundamental constants of QCD; an introductory discussion of lattice QCD, the only known method for obtaining exact predictions from QCD; methods for approximating QCD, with special focus on effective field theories; QCD under extreme conditions; measurements and predictions of meson and baryon states; a special discussion of the structure of the nucleon; techniques for study of QCD at high energy, including treatment of jets and showers; measurements at colliders; weak decays and quark mixing; and a section on the future, which discusses new experimental facilities or upgrades currently funded. The paper is intended to provide a broad background for Ph.D. students and postdocs starting their career. Some contributions include personal accounts of how the ideas or experiments were developed.",

We study these correlators at two different temperatures $T=1.5T_c$ and $T=10^4T_c$ in the deconfined phase of SU(3) gauge theory. We use gradient flow for noise reduction. We perform both continuum and zero flow time limits to extract the heavy quark diffusion coefficient.

We analyze the corresponding order parameter, namely the Polyakov loop and its moments, and show, with a rigorous finite size scaling, that in the continuum limit the transition is of first order. We show that the use of a parallel tempering algorithm can significantly reduce the large auto-correlation times which are mainly caused by the supercritical slowing down. As a result, we calculate the transition temperature $w_0 T_c$ with per-mill precision, and the latent heat, carrying out controlled continuum and infinite volume extrapolations.",

To explore the order of phase transition on the lower left corner of Columbia plot and if possible, to locate the critical endpoint we performed simulations at temperatures around 181 and 121 MeV with lattice spacing $a=0.1361(20)$ fm corresponding to temporal lattice extent $N_τ=8,12$ with varying quark mass for two different volumes with aspect ratios $N_σ/N_τ$ ranging from 2 to 3.

It has been stressed that the former in particular is closely related to higher order cumulants of conserved charge fluctuations that are calculated in lattice QCD. We present here results on $c^2_T$ and $c^2_s$ and compare results at vanishing strangeness chemical potential and vanishing net strangeness number with hadron resonance gas model calculations. We stress the difference of both observables at low temperature arising from the light meson sector, which does not contribute to $c^2_T$.",

      "summary": "The rate of mixing between a neutral kaon and an anti-kaon ($K^0-\\bar{K}^0$) is given, in part, by a long-range matrix element, defined with two insertions of the weak Hamiltonian separated by physical, Minkowski time evolution. For physical quark masses, the kaon mass lies above the two- and three-pion thresholds and, as a result, this long-range matrix element receives contributions from intermediate on-shell $2π$ and $3π$ states. These contributions cannot easily be captured in a finite Euclidean spacetime, meaning that such matrix elements are not directly accessible via lattice QCD. In this talk, we present a strategy for combining quantities that can be extracted in numerical lattice QCD calculations in order to reproduce the physical, infinite-volume long-range amplitude for $K^0-\\bar{K}^0$. The key novelty relative to published work is that we fully include the effects of three-particle states that were previously neglected. The strategy is built on existing formalism for long-range matrix elements with two-particle intermediate states, together with the relativistic-field-theory finite-volume formalism for extracting three-hadron weak decays.",

      "summary": "In this work, we present a numerical investigation of a novel Lorentz-covariant parametrization to extract $x$-dependent GPDs using off-forward matrix elements of momentum-boosted hadrons coupled to non-local operators. The novelty of the method is the implementation of an asymmetric frame for the momentum transfer between the initial and final hadron state and the parametrization of the matrix elements into Lorentz-invariant amplitudes. The amplitudes can then be related to the standard light-cone GPDs.\n  GPDs are defined in the symmetric frame, which requires a separate calculation for each value of the momentum transfer, increasing the computational cost significantly. The proposed method is powerful, as one can extract the GPDs at multiple values of the momentum transfer at the computational cost of a single value. For this proof-of-concept calculation, we use one ensemble of $N_f=2+1+1$ twisted mass fermions and a clover improvement with a pion mass of 260 MeV to calculate the proton unpolarized GPDs.",

      "summary": "We have recently shown that critical Anderson electron in $D=3$ dimensions effectively occupies a spatial region of infrared (IR) scaling dimension $d_\\text{IR} \\approx 8/3$. Here we inquire about the dimensional substructure involved. We partition space into regions of equal quantum occurrence probability, such that points comprising a region are of similar relevance, and calculate the IR scaling dimension $d$ of each. This allows us to infer the probability density $p(d)$ for dimension $d$ to be accessed by electron. We find that $p(d)$ has a strong peak at $d$ very close to 2. In fact, our data suggests that $p(d)$ is non-zero on the interval $[d_\\text{min}, d_\\text{max}] \\approx [4/3,8/3]$ and may develop a discrete part ($δ$-function) at $d=2$ in infinite-volume limit. The latter invokes the possibility that combination of quantum mechanics and pure disorder can lead to emergence of topological dimensions. Although $d_\\text{IR}$ is based on effective counting of which $p(d)$ has no a priori knowledge, $d_\\text{IR} \\ge d_\\text{max}$ is an exact feature of the ensuing formalism. Possible connection of our results to recent findings of $d_\\text{IR} \\approx 2$ in Dirac near-zero modes of thermal quantum chromodynamics is emphasized.",

Spectator effects arise from the dimension-$6$ operators in the HQE in which along with the heavy quark, a light spectator quark from the hadron participates in the weak decay. In this work, we provide a lattice determination of the bare matrix elements that contribute to the spectator effects for the $B^+$-meson, $B_d$-meson and the $Λ_b$-baryon. The computations were performed on two separate lattice spacings of the RBC-UKQCD (2+1)-flavor Domain Wall Fermion ensembles. Renormalization and continuum extrapolation of the matrix elements have not yet been computed, and are left to future work.",

We obtain results for the static energy out to distances of nearly 1 fm, allowing us to perform a simultaneous determination of the lattice scales $r_2$, $r_1$ and $r_0$ as well as the string tension, $σ$. While our results for ${r_0}/{r_1}$ and $r_0$ $\\sqrtσ$ agree with published (2+1)-flavor results, our result for ${r_1}/{r_2}$ differs significantly from the value obtained in the (2+1)-flavor case, likely due to the effect of the charm quark. We study in detail the effect of the charm quark on the static energy by comparing our results on the finest lattices with the previously published (2+1)-flavor QCD results at similar lattice spacing. The lattice results agree well with the two-loop perturbative expression of the static energy incorporating finite charm mass effects.",

      "summary": "Motivated by attempts to quantum simulate lattice models with continuous Abelian symmetries using discrete approximations, we consider an extended-O(2) model that differs from the ordinary O(2) model by an explicit symmetry breaking term. Its coupling allows to smoothly interpolate between the O(2) model (zero coupling) and a $q$-state clock model (infinite coupling). In the latter case, a $q$-state clock model can also be defined for non-integer values of $q$. Thus, such a limit can also be considered as an analytic continuation of an ordinary $q$-state clock model to non-integer $q$. The phase diagram of the extended-O(2) model in the infinite coupling limit was established in our previous work, where it was shown that for non-integer $q$, there is a second-order phase transition at low temperature and a crossover at high temperature. In this work, we investigate the model at finite values of the coupling using Monte Carlo and tensor methods. The results may be relevant for configurable Rydberg-atom arrays.",

      "summary": "Precise exploration of the partonic structure of the nucleon is one of the most important aims of high-energy physics. In recent years, it has become possible to address this topic with first-principle lattice QCD investigations. In this talk, we focus on the so-called pseudo-distribution approach to determine the isovector unpolarized PDFs. In particular, we employ three lattice spacings to study discretization effects and extract the distributions in the continuum limit, at a pion mass of around 370 MeV. Also, for the first time with pseudo-PDFs, we explore effects of the 2-loop matching from pseudo- to light-cone distributions.",

      "summary": "Real-time scattering calculations on a Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) quantum computer are disrupted by errors that accumulate throughout the circuits. To improve the accuracy of such physics simulations, one can supplement the application circuits with a recent error mitigation strategy known as Noisy Output eXtrapolation (NOX). We tested these error mitigation protocols on a Transverse Field Ising model and improved upon previous calculations of the phase shift. Our proof-of-concept 4-qubit application circuits were run on several IBM quantum computing hardware architectures. Metrics were introduced that show between 21\\% and 74\\% error reduction for circuit depths ranging from 14 to 37 hard cycles, confirming that the NOX technique applies to circuits with a broad range of failure rates. This observation on different cloud-accessible devices further confirms that NOX provides performance improvements even in the advent where circuits are executed in substantially time-separated batches. Finally, we provide a heuristic method to obtain systematic error bars on the mitigated results, compare them with empirical errors and discuss their effects on phase shift estimates.",

      "title": "Optimizing Shift Selection in Multilevel Monte Carlo for Disconnected Diagrams in Lattice QCD",
      "summary": "The calculation of disconnected diagram contributions to physical signals is a computationally expensive task in Lattice QCD. To extract the physical signal, the trace of the inverse Lattice Dirac operator, a large sparse matrix, must be stochastically estimated. Because the variance of the stochastic estimator is typically large, variance reduction techniques must be employed. Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods reduce the variance of the trace estimator by utilizing a telescoping sequence of estimators. Frequency Splitting is one such method that uses a sequence of inverses of shifted operators to estimate the trace of the inverse lattice Dirac operator, however there is no a priori way to select the shifts that minimize the cost of the multilevel trace estimation. In this article, we present a sampling and interpolation scheme that is able to predict the variances associated with Frequency Splitting under displacements of the underlying space time lattice. The interpolation scheme is able to predict the variances to high accuracy and therefore choose shifts that correspond to an approximate minimum of the cost for the trace estimation. We show that Frequency Splitting with the chosen shifts displays significant speedups over multigrid deflation, and that these shifts can be used for multiple configurations within the same ensemble with no penalty to performance.",

The real-time evolution of an interpreted charge-anticharge, in our Rydberg model, displays features similar to string-breaking - reminiscent of the Lund string fragmentation model used in PYTHIA for hadronization. We calculate the real-time evolution classically for a Rydberg simulator with up to 26 atoms.

We pay special attention to the large $N$ limit, which is taken along a very peculiar sequence, with the number of colors $N$ and the magnetic flux $m$ selected respectively as the $n$-th and $n-2$ terms of the Fibonacci sequence. We discuss the large $N$ scaling of the solutions and analyze several gauge invariant quantities as the Polyakov loops.

Recent lattice QCD calculations predict values for the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution that are larger than the data-driven estimates, bringing the Standard Model prediction closer to the experimental measurement. Euclidean time windows in the time-momentum representation of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon $g-2$ can help clarify the discrepancy between the phenomenological and lattice predictions. We present our calculation of the intermediate distance window contribution using $N_\\mathrm{f}=2+1$ flavors of O$(a)$ improved Wilson quarks. We employ ensembles at six lattice spacings below $0.1\\,$fm and pion masses down to the physical value. We present a detailed study of the continuum limit, using two discretizations of the vector current and two independent sets of improvement coefficients. Our result at the physical point displays a tension of $3.9\\,σ$ with a recent evaluation of the intermediate window based on the data-driven method.",

      "summary": "I describe how simulations of lattice QCD using the path integral formulation provide the two basic quantum mechanical properties of QCD, its ground state in which correlation functions are calculated, and Fock state wavefunctions between which matrix elements of operators are calculated. Both constructs are stochastic, so unfortunately one gets no intuitive picture or even a qualitative understanding of what they look like, nevertheless they contain and display all the subtleties of the quantum field theory. Today, these simulations provide many quantities that are impacting phenomenology and experiments. I illustrate the methods and the steps in the analysis using, as examples, three observables: the isovector charges of the nucleon, the contribution of the quark's intrinsic spin to the nucleon spin, and the pion-nucleon sigma term.",

      "summary": "Resonances play an important role in Standard Model phenomenology. In particular, hadronic resonances feature in $B$ and $D$ decays, which can be central for New Physics searches. Lattice QCD simulations combined with the finite-volume method can nowadays be used to reliably study strongly coupled scattering processes such as $Kπ$ and thus the hadronic resonance $K^*$. In this work, we approach $Kπ$ scattering on a domain-wall $N_f = 2+1$ RBC-UKQCD ensemble at a physical pion mass. We use the distillation method within Grid and Hadrons software to compute sets of operator basis. That allows solving an eigenvalue problem to extract the low-energy finite-volume spectra, which are then translated into scattering information. We update the state of the calculation by reviewing the smearing process, outlining the variational analysis and concluding by showing preliminary data.",

This architecture is used to interpolate the chiral condensate obtained from QCD simulations with five degenerate quark flavors in the HISQ action. From this a model for the probability distribution of the chiral condensate as function of lattice volume, quark mass and gauge coupling is obtained. Using the model, first order and crossover regions can be classified and the boundary between these regions can be marked by a critical mass. An extension of this model to studies of phase transitions in QCD with variable number of flavors is expected to be possible.",

We present a solution for eliminating an inevitable contamination term that dominates the Euclidean correlations and makes determining gluon helicity PDF unfeasible. The proposed synergy between lattice QCD and artificial intelligence offers a superior platform to alleviate the defining challenge of extracting quark and gluon PDFs from the lattice data that are available in a limited domain due to a finite range of accessible hadron momenta. We suggest a systematically improvable method to extract PDFs from the lattice data, independent of inadequate parametrizations. The result of the gluon helicity will improve our understanding of the role of spin in the strong interaction and the nucleon spin structure.",

The existing lattice results, which presently show good consistency among each other, are in strong tension with the data-driven determination. In order to check for a potentially common source of systematic error of the lattice calculations, which are all based on the time-momentum representation (TMR), we perform a calculation using a Lorentz-covariant coordinate-space (CCS) representation. We present results for the isovector and the connected strange-quark contributions to the intermediate window quantity at a reference point in the $(m_π,m_K)$ plane, in the continuum and infinite-volume limit, based on four different lattice spacings. Our results are in good agreement with those of the recent TMR-based Mainz-CLS publication.",

      "title": "All-mode Renormalization for Tensor Network with Stochastic Noise",
      "summary": "In usual (non-stochastic) tensor network calculations, the truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) is often used for approximating a tensor, and it causes systematic errors. By introducing stochastic noise in the approximation, however, one can avoid such systematic errors at the expense of statistical errors which can be straightforwardly controlled. Therefore in principle, exact results can be obtained even at finite bond dimension up to the statistical errors. A previous study of the unbiased method implemented in tensor renormalization group (TRG) algorithm, however, showed that the statistical errors for physical quantity are not negligible, and furthermore the computational cost is linearly proportional to a system volume. In this paper, we introduce a new way of stochastic noise such that the statistical error is suppressed, and moreover, in order to reduce the computational cost we propose common noise method whose cost is proportional to the logarithm of volume. We find that the method provides better accuracy for the free energy compared with the truncated SVD when applying to TRG for Ising model on square lattice. Although the common noise method introduces systematic error originated from a correlation of noises, we show that the error can be described by a simple functional form in terms of the number of noises, thus the error can be straightforwardly controlled in an actual analysis. We also apply the method to the graph independent local truncation algorithm and show that the accuracy is further improved.",

      "summary": "The decreasing uncertainties in theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of several hadronic observables related to weak processes, which in many cases are now smaller than $\\mathrm{O}(1\\%)$, require theoretical calculations to include subleading corrections that were neglected so far. Precise determinations of leptonic and semi-leptonic decay rates, including QED and strong isospin-breaking effects, can play a central role in solving the current tensions in the first-row unitarity of the CKM matrix. In this work we present the first RBC/UKQCD lattice calculation of the isospin-breaking corrections to the ratio of leptonic decay rates of kaons and pions into muons and neutrinos. The calculation is performed with $N_\\mathrm{f}=2+1$ dynamical quarks close to the physical point and domain wall fermions in the Möbius formulation are employed. Long-distance QED interactions are included according to the $\\mathrm{QED_L}$ prescription and the crucial role of finite-volume electromagnetic corrections in the determination of leptonic decay rates, which produce a large systematic uncertainty, is extensively discussed. Finally, we study the different sources of uncertainty on $|V_\\mathrm{us}|/|V_\\mathrm{ud}|$ and observe that, if finite-volume systematics can be reduced, the error from isospin-breaking corrections is potentially sub-dominant in the final precision of the ratio of the CKM matrix elements.",

However, different definitions of flows and operators can differ significantly, suggesting possible systematical effects. Using a subset of RBC-UKQCD's 2+1 flavor domain wall fermion and Iwasaki gauge action ensembles, we explore differences between $\\sqrt{t_0}$ and $w_0$ gradient flow scales, compare the impact of different operators to define the energy density, and study the effect of using tree-level improvement for the gradient flow. We find that for this set of gauge field ensembles Zeuthen flow with Symanzik operators has the most consistent approach to the continuum limit and exhibit very small cutoff corrections. Tree-level improvement, traditionally used in step-scaling studies, significantly reduces the spread between different operators, but does not lead to an overall improvement when it comes to reducing cutoff effects for gradient flow scales $\\sqrt{t_0}$ or $w_0$.",

We have collected more statistics on previous ensembles, and we added two new ensembles. This allows us to reduce statistical errors on the HVP contribution and related window quantities significantly. We also calculated the current-current correlator to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in staggered chiralperturbation theory, so that we can correct to NNLO for finite-volume, pion-mass mistuning and taste-breaking effects. We discuss the applicability of NNLO chiral perturbation theory, emphasizing that it provides a systematic EFT approach to the HVP contribution, but not to short- or intermediate-distance window quantities. This makes it difficult to assess systematic errors on the standard intermediate-distance window quantity that is now widely considered in the literature. In view of this, we investigate a longer-distance window, for which EFT methods should be more reliable. Our most important conclusion is that new high-statistics computations at lattice spacings significantly smaller than 0.06 fm are indispensable. The ensembles we use have been generously provided by MILC and CalLat.",

Firstly, we find that allowing a nonvanishing $s_-(x)$, at the initial $Q_0=1.3$~GeV scale, in a global PDF analysis leads to a CT18As fit with similar quality to CT18A. Secondly, including the lattice data in the CT18As\\_Lat fit greatly reduces the $s_-$-PDF error band size in the large-$x$ region. To further reduce its error would require more precise lattice data, extended to smaller $x$ values. We take ATLAS 7 TeV $W$ and $Z$ production data, SIDIS di-muon production data, $F_3$ structure function data, E866 NuSea data, and E906 SeaQuest data as examples to illustrate the implication of CT18As and CT18As\\_Lat fits. The parametrization dependence for PDF ratio $(s+\\bar{s})/(\\bar{u}+\\bar{d})(x)$ is analyzed with CT18As2 and CT18As2\\_Lat fits as results.",

We find that utilizing dimensional reduction can make efficient use of two-dimensional layouts presently available on cold atom quantum simulators. A new definition of the renormalized coupling is introduced, which is applicable to systems with open boundary conditions and can be measured using analog quantum simulators. Monte Carlo and tensor network calculations are performed to determine the quantum resources required to reproduce perturbative short-distance observables. In particular, we show that a rectangular array of 48 Rydberg atoms with existing quantum hardware capabilities should be able to adiabatically prepare low-energy states of the perturbatively-matched theory. These states can then be used to simulate non-perturbative observables in the continuum limit that lie beyond the reach of classical computers.",

      "summary": "Recent applications of machine-learned normalizing flows to sampling in lattice field theory suggest that such methods may be able to mitigate critical slowing down and topological freezing. However, these demonstrations have been at the scale of toy models, and it remains to be determined whether they can be applied to state-of-the-art lattice quantum chromodynamics calculations. Assessing the viability of sampling algorithms for lattice field theory at scale has traditionally been accomplished using simple cost scaling laws, but as we discuss in this work, their utility is limited for flow-based approaches. We conclude that flow-based approaches to sampling are better thought of as a broad family of algorithms with different scaling properties, and that scalability must be assessed experimentally.",

If a system has the infinite variance problem, one cannot estimate observables reliably even with an infinite number of samples. In this paper, we explore a method to deal with this problem based on sampling according to the distribution of a system with an extra time-slice. The necessary reweighting factor is computed both perturbatively and through a secondary Monte Carlo. We show that the Monte Carlo reweigthing coupled to the use of a non-biased estimator of the reweigthing factor leads to a method that eliminates the infinite variance problem at a very small extra cost. We compute the double occupancy in the Hubbard model at half-filling to demonstrate the method and compare the results to well established results obtained by other methods.",

This suggests it be given increasing attention theoretically in the coming years, given also the fact that Belle-II will have much larger data samples to study; similar comments also apply to LHCb as well as ATLAS and CMS. The fact that $τ$ decays provide valuable information on its spin is an added advantage. This gains special significance if the current indications of new physics are upheld since naturalness arguments then strongly suggest that new physics should be accompanied by new CP-odd phase(s). Moreover, the fact that the $τ$ mass is around 1.8 GeV,~{\\it i.e} a lot less than the B-meson mass makes it much easier candidate for lattice studies in great detail and consequently very likely with greater precision.

      "summary": "Smearing of gauge-field configurations in lattice field theory improves the results of lattice simulations by suppressing high energy modes from correlation functions. In quantum simulations, high kinetic energy eigenstates are introduced when the time evolution operator is approximated such as Trotterization. While improved Trotter product formulae exist to reduce the errors, they have diminishing accuracy returns with respect to resource costs. Therefore having an algorithm that has fewer resources than an improved Trotter formula is desirable. In this work I develop a representation agnostic method for quantum smearing and show that it reduces the coupling to high energy modes in the discrete nonabelian gauge theory $D_4$",

Our calculations are performed with the PACS10 gauge configurations generated by the PACS Collaboration with the six stout-smeared $O(a)$ improved Wilson-clover quark action and Iwasaki gauge action at $β$ = 1.82 and 2.00 corresponding to lattice spacings of 0.085 fm and 0.063 fm respectively. We first evaluate the value of $g_A/g_V$ , which is not renormalized in the continuum limit and thus ends up with the renormalized axial charge. Moreover, we also calculate the nucleon elastic form factors and determine three kinds of isovector RMS radii such as electric, magnetic and axial ones at the two lattice spacings. We finally discuss the discretization uncertainties on renormalized axial charge and isovector RMS radii towards the continuum limit.",

When considering additional states exceeding those measured with high confidence by the Particle Data Group, attractive corrections to the overall pressure in the HRG model are imposed. On the other hand, we also apply excluded-volume corrections, which ensure there is no overlap of baryons by turning on repulsive (anti)baryon-(anti)baryon interactions. We emphasize the complementary nature of these two extensions and identify combinations of conserved charge susceptibilities that allow us to constrain them separately. In particular, we find interesting ratios of susceptibilities that are sensitive to one correction and not the other. This allows us to constrain the excluded volume and particle spectrum effects separately. Analysis of the available lattice results suggests the presence of both the extra states in the baryon-strangeness sector and the repulsive baryonic interaction, with indications that hyperons have a smaller repulsive core than non-strange baryons. We note that these results are interesting for heavy-ion-collision systems at both the LHC and RHIC.",

      "summary": "The non-singlet helicity quark parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the nucleon are determined from lattice QCD, by jointly leveraging pseudo-distributions and the distillation spatial smearing paradigm. A Lorentz decomposition of appropriately isolated space-like matrix elements reveals pseudo-distributions that contain information on the leading-twist helicity PDFs, as well as an invariant amplitude that induces an additional $z^2$ contamination of the leading-twist signal. An analysis of the short-distance behavior of the space-like matrix elements using matching coefficients computed to next-to-leading order (NLO) exposes the desired PDF up to this additional $z^2$ contamination. Due to the non-conservation of the axial current, we elect to isolate the helicity PDFs normalized by the nucleon axial charge at the same scale $μ^2$. The leading-twist helicity PDFs as well as several sources of systematic error, including higher-twist effects, discretization errors, and the aforementioned $z^2$ contaminating amplitude are jointly determined by characterizing the computed pseudo-distribution in a basis of Jacobi polynomials. The Akaike Information Criterion is exploited to effectively average over distinct model parameterizations and cuts on the pseudo-distribution. Encouraging agreement is observed with recent global analyses of each non-singlet quark helicity PDF, notably a rather small non-singlet anti-quark helicity PDF for all quark momentum fractions.",

      "summary": "The step-scaling function, the lattice analog of the renormalization group $β$ function, is presented for the SU(3) gauge system with eight flavors in the fundamental representation. Our investigation is based on generating dynamical eight flavor gauge field configurations using stout-smeared Möbius domain wall fermions and Symanzik gauge action. On these gauge field configurations we perform gradient flow measurements using the Zeuthen, Wilson, or Symanzik kernel and consider the Symanzik, Wilson plaquette, or clover operators to determine step-scaling functions for a scale change $s=2$ including large, up to $48^4$, volumes. Considering different flows and operators as well as the optional use of tree-level improvement allows us to check for possible systematic effects. Our result covers the range of renormalized coupling up to $g_c^2 \\lesssim 10$. In the case of $N_f=8$ we observe that the reach in $g_c^2$ is limited due to an unphysical first order bulk phase transition caused by large ultra-violet fluctuations.\n  We compare our findings to $N_f=4$, 6, 10 or 12 flavors results that are obtained using the same lattice action and analysis. In addition we investigate the phase structure for simulations with different number of flavors using stout-smeared Möbius domain wall fermions and Symanzik gauge actions to shed some light on the limited reach in $g_c^2$.",

This process makes one of the largest contributions to the uncertainty of the Standard Model prediction for the muon $(g-2)$. Lattice QCD allows for a first-principles approach to computing this non-perturbative effect. In order to avoid power-law finite-size artifacts generated by virtual photons in lattice simulations, we follow a coordinate-space approach involving a weighted integral over the vertices of the QCD four-point function of the electromagnetic current carried by the quarks. Here we present in detail the semi-analytical calculation of the QED part of the amplitude, employing position-space perturbation theory in continuous, infinite four-dimensional Euclidean space. We also provide some useful information about a computer code for the numerical implementation of our approach that has been made public at https://github.com/RJHudspith/KQED.",

      "summary": "We simulate Lattice QED in a constant external magnetic field using the RHMC algorithm. We seek evidence for chiral symmetry breaking predicted by truncated Schwinger-Dyson methods. Since the predicted values of the dynamical electron mass and chiral condensate at the physical fine structure constant are too small to be measured, we simulate at a larger value $α=1/5$. This requires using electron masses as low as $m=0.001$ to extrapolate to $m=0$. At a large magnetic field, the electrons occupy the lowest Landau level which has a small profile in the plane orthogonal to the magnetic field, so that we are able to use a lattice with small extent in these 2 directions. If chiral symmetry is unbroken at $m=0$ the chiral condensate is dominated by large momenta and should be insensitive to the lattice extent in the direction of the magnetic field and the time direction. When chiral symmetry is broken at $m=0$, the chiral condensate should be sensitive to the lattice size in these directions as $m \\rightarrow 0$. We search for this behaviour by increasing the lattice extent in these 2 directions. Preliminary simulations show strong dependence of the chiral condensate on the lattice extent in these 2 directions for the smallest masses, and these increased condensates appear to be approaching a non-zero limit as $m \\rightarrow 0$.",

We use clover fermions for the valence action on three lattice spacings $a \\approx 0.9$, 0.12 and 0.15~fm and three pion masses $M_π\\approx 220$, 310 and 690~MeV, with nucleon two-point measurements numbering up to $O(10^6)$ and nucleon boost momenta up to 3~GeV. We study the lattice-spacing and pion-mass dependence of the reduced pseudo-ITD matrix elements obtained from the lattice calculation, then extrapolate them to the continuum-physical limit before extracting $xg(x)/\\langle x \\rangle_g$. We use the gluon momentum fraction $\\langle x \\rangle_g$ calculated from the same ensembles to determine the nucleon gluon unpolarized PDF $xg(x)$ for the first time entirely through lattice-QCD simulation.

In this work, we explain how the infinite-volume Minkowski amplitude can be constrained from finite-volume Euclidean correlation functions. The relationship between the finite-volume Euclidean correlation functions and the desired amplitude holds up to energies where $3π$ states can go on shell, and is exact up to exponentially small corrections that scale like $\\mathcal{O}(e^{-m_πL})$, where $L$ is the spatial extent of the cubic volume and $m_π$ is the pion mass. In order to implement this formalism and remove all power-law finite volume errors, it is necessary to first obtain $ππ\\to ππ$, $πγ^\\star \\to π$, $γ^\\star \\toππ$, and $ππγ^\\star \\toππ$ amplitudes; all of which can be determined via lattice quantum chromodynamic calculations.",

The extension to a complete Euclidean lattice Monte Carlo computation, however, is hampered by analytic continuations that are ill-suited to numerical treatment, and the nonequilibrium nature of a metastable state. In this paper we develop a new methodology to compute vacuum decay rates from Monte Carlo simulations of Euclidean lattice theories. To test the new method, we consider simple quantum mechanical systems systems with metastable vacua. This work can be extended to Euclidean field theories, which we discuss in the Conclusions.",

For $λφ^4$ models, the perturbative series have a zero radius of convergence which in part motivated the design of digitized versions suitable for quantum computing. In agreement with general arguments suggesting that a large field cutoff modifies Dyson's reasoning and improves convergence properties, we show that the harmonic digitizations of $λφ^4$ lattice field theories lead to weak coupling expansions with a finite radius of convergence. Similar convergence properties are found for strong coupling expansions. We compare the resources needed to calculate the real-time evolution of the digitized models with perturbative expansions to those needed to do so with universal quantum computers. Unless new approximate methods can be designed to calculate long perturbative series for large systems efficiently, it appears that the use of universal quantum computers with digitizations involving a few qubits per site has the potential for more efficient calculations of the real-time evolution for large systems at intermediate coupling.",

To this end, we perform lattice Monte Carlo simulations of the Berenstein-Maldacena-Nastase (BMN) matrix model, which is the one-parameter deformation of the Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind (BFSS) matrix model, taking both the large $N$ and continuum limits. We leverage the fact that sufficiently small flux parameters in the BMN matrix model have a negligible impact on the energy of the system while stabilizing the flat directions so that simulations at smaller $N$ than in the BFSS matrix model are possible. Hence, we can perform a precision measurement of the large $N$ continuum energy at the lowest temperatures to date. The energy is in perfect agreement with supergravity predictions including estimations of $α'$-corrections from previous simulations. At the lowest temperature where we can simulate efficiently ($T=0.25λ^{1/3}$, where $λ$ is the 't Hooft coupling), the difference in energy to the pure supergravity prediction is less than $10\\%$. Furthermore, we can extract the coefficient of the $1/N^4$ corrections at a fixed temperature with good accuracy, which was previously unknown.",

Studying real-time phenomena has proven challenging with classical-simulation methods, but is a natural application of quantum simulation. To demonstrate this prospect, we quantum compute non-equal time correlation functions and perform entanglement tomography of non-equilibrium states of a simple lattice gauge theory, the Schwinger model, using a trapped-ion quantum computer by IonQ Inc. As an ideal target for near-term devices, a recently-predicted [Zache et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 050403 (2019)] dynamical quantum phase transition in this model is studied by preparing, quenching, and tracking the subsequent non-equilibrium dynamics in three ways: i) overlap echos signaling dynamical transitions, ii) non-equal time correlation functions with an underlying topological nature, and iii) the entanglement structure of non-equilibrium states, including entanglement Hamiltonians. These results constitute the first observation of a dynamical quantum phase transition in a lattice gauge theory on a quantum computer, and are a first step toward investigating topological phenomena in nuclear and high-energy physics using quantum technologies.",

The latter arise from both approximations in solving the nuclear many-body problem and in the determination of the single- and few-nucleon quantities taken as input by many-body methods. To quantify both types of uncertainty, we compute flux-averaged double-differential cross sections using the Green's function Monte Carlo and spectral function methods as well as different parameterizations of the nucleon axial form factors based on either deuterium bubble-chamber data or lattice quantum chromodynamics calculations. The cross-section results are compared with available experimental data from the MiniBooNE and T2K collaborations. We also discuss the uncertainties associated with $N\\rightarrow Δ$ transition form factors that enter the two-body current operator. We quantify the relations between neutrino-nucleus cross section and nucleon form factor uncertainties. These relations enable us to determine the form factor precision targets required to achieve a given cross-section precision.",

Full conformal invariance of the $c= 1/2$ minimal CFT is restored by introducing a metric on the lattice through the map $\\sinh(2K_i) = \\ell^*_i/ \\ell_i$ which relates critical couplings to the ratio of the dual hexagonal and triangular edge lengths. Applied to a 2d toroidal lattice, this provides an exact lattice formulation in the continuum limit to the Ising CFT as a function of the modular parameter. This example can be viewed as a quantum generalization of the finite element method (FEM) applied to the strong coupling CFT at a Wilson-Fisher IR fixed point and suggests a new approach to conformal field theory on curved manifolds based on a synthesis of simplicial geometry and projective geometry on the tangent planes.",

Choosing well-understood, QCD-like systems with SU(3) gauge group and either six or four fundamental flavors, we investigate their step-scaling $β$ function. In both cases we push the simulations to the boundary of chiral symmetry breaking and study the regime $g^2_{GF} \\lesssim 8.2$ with six, and $g^2_{GF} \\lesssim 6.6$ with four flavors. We carefully consider the lattice discretization errors by comparing three different gradient flows (GF), and for each flow three operators to estimate the renormalized finite volume coupling. We also consider the tree level improvement of the coupling. Noteworthy outcome is that nonperturbatively determined $β$ functions run much slower than perturbatively predicted.",

A single generation of the Standard Model is found to require 16 qubits per spatial lattice site after mapping to spin operators via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Both quantum chromodynamics and flavor-changing weak interactions are included in the dynamics, the latter through four-Fermi effective operators. Quantum circuits which implement time evolution in this lattice theory are developed and run on Quantinuum's H1-1 20-qubit trapped ion system to simulate the $β$-decay of a single baryon on one lattice site. These simulations include the initial state preparation and are performed for both one and two Trotter time steps. The potential intrinsic error-correction properties of this type of lattice theory are discussed and the leading lattice Hamiltonian required to simulate $0νββ$-decay of nuclei induced by a neutrino Majorana mass term is provided.",

      "summary": "Although equivalent in the infinite-momentum limit, large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) and short-distance operator product expansion (SD-OPE) are two different approaches to extract parton distribution functions (PDFs) from coordinate-space correlation functions in large-momentum hadrons. LaMET implements a momentum-space expansion in $Λ_{\\rm QCD}/[x(1-x)P^z]$ to directly calculate PDFs $f(x)$ in a middle region of Bjorken $x\\in [x_{\\rm min}\\sim Λ_{\\rm QCD}/P^z, x_{\\rm max}\\sim 1-x_{\\min}]$. SD-OPE applies perturbative QCD at small Euclidean distances $z$ to extract a range $[0,λ_{\\rm max}]$ of leading-twist correlations, $h(λ=zP^z)$, corresponding to the Fourier transformation of PDFs. Similar to the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle, an incomplete leading-twist correlation cannot be readily converted to a momentum-space local distribution, and the methods to solve the ``inverse problem'' involve essentially modelling of the missing information beyond $λ_{\\rm max}$. On the other hand, short-distance correlations, along with the expected end-point asymptotics, can be used to phenomenologically fit the PDFs in the LaMET-complementary regions: $x\\in [0,x_{\\rm min}]$ and $[x_{\\rm max}, 1]$. We use the recent results of the pion valence quark distribution from the ANL/BNL collaboration to demonstrate this point.",

      "title": "Fundamental Physics in Small Experiments",
      "summary": "High energy physics aims to understand the fundamental laws of particles and their interactions at both the largest and smallest scales of the universe. This typically means probing very high energies or large distances or using high-intensity beams, which often requires large-scale experiments. A complementary approach is offered through high-precision measurements in small- and mid-scale size experiments, often at lower energies. The field of such high-precision experiments has seen tremendous progress and importance for particle physics for at least two reasons. First, they exploit synergies to adjacent areas of particle physics and benefit by many recent advances in experimental techniques. Together with intensified phenomenological explorations, these advances led to the realization that challenges associated with weak couplings or the expected suppression factors from the mass scale of new physics can be overcome with such methods. Second, many of these measurements add a new set of particle physics phenomena and observables that can be reached compared to the more conventional methodologies using high energies. Combining high-precision, smaller-scale measurements with the large-scale efforts therefore casts a wider and tighter net for possible effects originating from physics beyond the Standard Model.\n  This report presents a broad set of small-scale research projects that could provide key new precision measurements in the areas of electric dipole moments, magnetic dipole moments, fermion flavor violation, tests of spacetime symmetries, and tests with gravity. The growing impact of these high-precision studies in high energy physics and the complementary input they provide compared to large-scale efforts warrants strong support over the next decades. In particular, EDM searches are expected to improve sensitivities by four or more orders of magnitude in the next decade or two.",

In this paper, we compute such gauge invariant fermionic observables to order $q^2$ in lattice perturbation theory with the same conformal measure.

      "title": "Generalized Parton Distributions from Lattice QCD with Asymmetric Momentum Transfer: Unpolarized Quarks",
      "summary": "Traditionally, lattice QCD computations of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) have been carried out in a symmetric frame, where the transferred momentum is symmetrically distributed between the incoming and outgoing hadrons. However, such frames are inconvenient since they require a separate calculation for each value of the momentum transfer, increasing significantly the computational cost. In this work, by focusing on the quasi-distribution approach, we lay the foundation for faster and more effective lattice QCD calculations of GPDs exploiting asymmetric frames, with freedom in the transferred momentum distribution. An important ingredient of our approach is the Lorentz covariant parameterization of the matrix elements in terms of Lorentz-invariant amplitudes, which allows one to relate matrix elements in different frames. We also use this amplitude approach to propose a new definition of quasi-GPDs that is frame-independent and, more importantly, may lead to smaller power corrections in the matching relations to the light-cone GPDs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the formalism through numerical calculations using one ensemble of $N_f$=2+1+1 twisted mass fermions with a clover improvement. The value of the light-quark masses lead to a pion mass of about 260 MeV. Concentrating on the proton, and limiting ourselves to a vanishing longitudinal momentum transfer to the target, we extract the invariant amplitudes from matrix element calculations in both the symmetric and asymmetric frame, and obtain results for the twist-2 light-cone GPDs for unpolarized quarks, that is, $H$ and $E$.",

Our method can be seen as a combination of the Taylor expansion and analytic continuation approaches. Its novelty lies in using rational (Padé) approximants for studying Lee-Yang edge singularities. We present a calculation of the cumulants of the net-baryon number as a function of a purely imaginary baryon number chemical potential, obtained with highly improved staggered quarks at temporal lattice extent of $N_τ=4,6$. We construct various rational function approximations of the lattice data and determine their poles (and roots) in the complex plane. We compare the position of the closest pole to the theoretically expected position of the Lee-Yang edge singularity. At high temperature, we find scaling that is in accordance with the expected power law behavior of the Roberge-Weiss transition while a different behavior is found for $T\\lesssim 170$ MeV.",

      "title": "'t Hooft anomalies for staggered fermions",
      "summary": "We show that the phase structure of certain staggered fermion theories can be understood on the basis of exact anomalies. These anomalies arise when staggered fermions are coupled to gravity which can be accomplished by replacing them by discrete Kähler-Dirac fermions. We first show the existence of a perturbative anomaly in even dimensions which breaks an exact $U(1)$ symmetry of the massless theory down to $Z_4$. If we attempt to gauge this $Z_4$ symmetry we find a 't Hooft anomaly which can only be cancelled for multiples of two Kähler-Dirac fields. This result is consistent with the cancellation of a further mixed non-perturbative 't Hooft anomaly between the global $Z_4$ and a reflection symmetry. In four dimensional flat space, theories of two staggered fields yield eight Dirac or sixteen Majorana fermions in the continuum limit and this critical number of fermions agrees with results in condensed matter theory literature on the fermion content required to gap boundary fermions in $4+1$ dimensional topological superconductors. It is also consistent with constraints stemming from the cancellation of spin-$Z_4$ anomalies of Weyl fermions. Indeed, cancellation of 't Hooft anomalies is a necessary requirement for symmetric mass generation and this result gives a theoretical explanation of recent numerical work on the phase diagram of interacting staggered fermions. As an application of these ideas we construct a lattice model whose low energy continuum limit is conjectured to yield the Pati-Salam GUT theory.",

      "summary": "Lattice QCD calculations of the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) have reached a precision where the electromagnetic (e.m.) correction can no longer be neglected. This correction is both computationally challenging and hard to validate, as it leads to ultraviolet (UV) divergences and to sizeable infrared (IR) effects associated with the massless photon. While we precisely determine the UV divergence using the operator-product expansion, we propose to introduce a separation scale $Λ\\sim400\\;$MeV into the internal photon propagator, whereby the calculation splits into a short-distance part, regulated in the UV by the lattice and in the IR by the scale $Λ$, and a UV-finite long-distance part to be treated with coordinate-space methods, thereby avoiding power-law finite-size effects altogether. In order to predict the long-distance part, we express the UV-regulated e.m. correction to the HVP via the forward hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) scattering amplitude and relate the latter via a dispersive sum rule to $γ^*γ^*$ fusion cross-sections. Having tested the relation by reproducing the two-loop QED vacuum polarization (VP) from the tree-level $γ^*γ^*\\to e^+e^-$ cross-section, we predict the expected lattice-QCD integrand resulting from the $γ^*γ^*\\toπ^0$ process.",

We show how to expose this scale dependence through resumming logarithms of the type $\\ln^n p_z/μ$ in the matching coefficient, where $μ$ is a fixed renormalization scale. The result enhances the accuracy of the expansion at moderate $p_z>1$ GeV, and at the same time, clearly shows that the partons cannot be approximated from quarks with $p_z\\sim Λ_{\\rm QCD}$ which are not predominantly collinear with the parent hadron momentum, consistent with power counting of the large-momentum effective theory.

      "summary": "It has recently been argued that noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers may be used to optimize interpolating operator constructions for lattice quantum field theory (LQFT) calculations on classical computers. Here, two concrete realizations of the method are developed and implemented. The first approach is to maximize the overlap, or fidelity, of the state created by an interpolating operator acting on the vacuum state to the target eigenstate. The second is to instead minimize the energy expectation value of the interpolated state. These approaches are implemented in a proof-of-concept calculation in (1+1)-dimensions for a single-flavor massive Schwinger model to obtain quantum-optimized interpolating operator constructions for a vector meson state in the theory. Although fidelity maximization is preferable in the absence of noise due to quantum gate errors, it is found that energy minimization is more robust to these effects in the proof-of-concept calculation. This work serves as a concrete demonstration of how quantum computers in the intermediate term might be used to accelerate classical LQFT calculations.",

Ideally, the truncated theory preserves the symmetries of the original model and has a critical point in the same universality class. In this paper, we explore two different truncations that preserve the symmetries of the 1+1-dimensional $O(3)$ non-linear $σ$-model - one that truncates the Hilbert space for the unit sphere by setting an angular momentum cutoff and a fuzzy sphere truncation inspired by non-commutative geometry. We compare the spectrum of the truncated theories in a finite box with the full theory. We use open boundary conditions, a novel method that improves on the correlation lengths accessible in our calculations. We provide evidence that the angular-momentum truncation fails to reproduce the $σ$-model and that the anti-ferromagnetic fuzzy model agrees with the full theory.",

In this work, we revisit the derivation of estimators for these model weights. Use of the Kullback-Leibler divergence as a starting point leads naturally to a number of alternative information criteria suitable for Bayesian model weight estimation. We explore three such criteria, known to the statistics literature before, in detail: a Bayesian analogue of the Akaike information criterion which we call the BAIC, the Bayesian predictive information criterion (BPIC), and the posterior predictive information criterion (PPIC). We compare the use of these information criteria in numerical analysis problems common in lattice field theory calculations. We find that the PPIC has the most appealing theoretical properties and can give the best performance in terms of model-averaging uncertainty, particularly in the presence of noisy data, while the BAIC is a simple and reliable alternative.",

We demonstrate the need to account for $S$--wave $Kπ$ elastic scattering when converting the finite-volume matrix elements computed in lattice QCD to the physically relevant infinite-volume matrix elements, even when we are primarily interested in the $P$--wave amplitude. Analytically continuing parameterizations of the $γK \\to Kπ$ amplitude to the $K^*$ resonance pole, we obtain the $K^{*+} \\to K^+ γ$ transition form-factor, and compare the $Q^2=0$ value to the corresponding value extracted from the experimental partial-decay width.",

Quantum computing offers a sign-problem-free approach but evaluating thermal expectation values is generally resource intensive on quantum computers. To facilitate thermodynamic studies of gauge theories, we propose a generalization of thermal-pure-quantum-state formulation of statistical mechanics applied to constrained gauge-theory dynamics, and numerically demonstrate that the phase diagram of a simple low-dimensional gauge theory is robustly determined using this approach, including mapping a chiral phase transition in the model at finite temperature and chemical potential. Quantum algorithms, resource requirements, and algorithmic and hardware error analysis are further discussed to motivate future implementations. Thermal pure quantum states, therefore, may present a suitable candidate for efficient thermal-state preparation in gauge theories in the era of quantum computing.",

      "summary": "Two methodologies have been presented in the literature which connect relativistic three-particle scattering amplitudes with lattice QCD spectra -- the ``relativistic effective field theory'' approach and the ``finite-volume unitarity'' method. While both methods have been shown to be equivalent in various works, it has not been shown how to arrive at the relativistic effective field theory results directly from $S$ matrix unitarity. In this work, we provide a simple proof of the relativistic effective field theory form of the scattering equations directly from unitarity. Motivated by the finite-volume unitarity approach, we then postulate a set of quantization conditions which relate the finite-volume energy spectra to the $K$ matrices which drive the short-distance physics in the scattering equations, obtaining all previously known results for three identical particles. This work also presents new relations which provide a new pathway to generalize the results to arbitrary systems.",

      "summary": "The advantage of simulating lattice field theory with quantum computers is hamstrung by the limited resources that induce large errors from finite volume and sizable lattice spacings. Previous work has shown how classical simulations near the Hamiltonian limit can be used for setting the lattice spacings in real-time through analytical continuation, thereby reducing errors in quantum simulations. In this work, we derive perturbative relations between bare and renormalized quantities in Euclidean spacetime at any anisotropy factor -- the ratio of spatial to temporal lattice spacings -- and in any spatial dimension for $U(N)$ and $SU(N)$. This reduces the required classical preprocessing for quantum simulations. We find less than $10\\%$ discrepancy between our perturbative results and those from existing nonperturbative determinations of the anisotropy for $SU(2)$ and $U(1)$ gauge theories. For the discrete groups $\\mathbb{Z}_{10}$, $\\mathbb{Z}_{100}$ and $\\mathbb{BI}$, we perform lattice Monte Carlo simulations to extract anisotropy factors and observe similar agreement with our perturbative results.",

Various arguments based on previous works and in particular on ref. \\cite{Chamizo:2016msz}, indicate that this choice of twist avoids the breakdown of volume independence in the large $N$ limit. These solutions become relevant on a Hamiltonian formulation of the gauge theory, where they represent vacuum-to-vacuum tunneling events lifting the degeneracy between electric flux sectors present in perturbation theory. We discuss the large $N$ scaling properties of the solutions and evaluate various gauge invariant quantities like the action density or Wilson and Polyakov loop operators.",

      "summary": "Precision measurements in weak decays of heavy flavored hadrons can test in unique ways our understanding of the fundamental interactions and of the observed baryon asymmetry in the Universe. The high sensitivity of such decays to beyond-Standard-Model physics, combined with the lack of major discoveries in direct production of new particles, motivates the continuation of a strong heavy-flavor program in the next decades. The observation of several anomalies by the BaBar, Belle and LHCb experiments in such decays, including evidence for violation of lepton universality, provides particular motivation to vigorously pursue this program. While the mass scales probed by direct searches for non-Standard-Model phenomena at the energy frontier will only marginally increase in the near future, a substantial advancement is expected in the study of weak decays of $b$ and $c$ quarks. The next 10 to 20 years will see the development of a highly synergistic program of experiments at both $pp$ and $e^+e^-$ colliders. This program will be complemented by advancements in theory, including both lattice and continuum calculations. Experimental measurements and theory predictions of several key observables will reach unprecedented precision and will allow to test the Standard Model in ways that have not been possible thus far. With a strong participation in this program, the US high-energy-physics community will remain at the forefront of indirect searches for new physics and retain its leading role in expanding humankind's understanding of fundamental interactions.",

The matrix elements are extrapolated to the continuum, physical light-quark mass, and infinite volume limit using a functional form derived in chiral Effective Field Theory ($χ\\mathrm{EFT}$).

Specifically, we use filtrations by traced Polyakov loops, topological densities, holonomy Lie algebra fields, as well as electric and magnetic fields. This allows for a comprehensive picture of confinement. In particular, topological densities form spatial lumps which show signatures of the classical probability distribution of instanton-dyons. Signatures of well-separated dyons located at random positions are encoded in holonomy Lie algebra fields, following the semi-classical temperature dependence of the instanton appearance probability. Debye screening discriminating between electric and magnetic fields is visible in persistent homology and pronounced at large gauge coupling. All employed constructions are gauge-invariant without a priori assumptions on the configurations under study. This work showcases the versatility of persistent homology for statistical and quantum physics studies, barely explored to date.",

The amplitudes are well-described by the effective range expansion with parameters constrained by fits to the finite-volume energy levels enabling a determination of the $I=3/2$ scattering length with statistical errors below $5\\%$, while the $I = 1/2$ is somewhat less precise. Systematic errors due to excited states and the influence of higher partial waves are controlled, providing a pathway for future computations down to the physical light quark masses with multiple lattice spacings and physical volumes.",

      "summary": "We extend the application of lattice QCD to the two-photon-mediated, order $α^2$ rare decay $π^0\\rightarrow e^+ e^-$. By combining Minkowski- and Euclidean-space methods we are able to calculate the complex amplitude describing this decay directly from the underlying theories (QCD and QED) which predict this decay. The leading connected and disconnected diagrams are considered; a continuum limit is evaluated and the systematic errors are estimated. We find $\\mathrm{Re} \\mathcal{A} = 18.60(1.19)(1.04)\\,$eV, $\\mathrm{Im} \\mathcal{A} = 32.59(1.50)(1.65)\\,$eV, a more accurate value for the ratio $\\frac{\\mathrm{Re} \\mathcal{A}}{\\mathrm{Im} \\mathcal{A}}=0.571(10)(4)$ and a result for the partial width $Γ(π^0\\toγγ) = 6.60(0.61)(0.67)\\,$eV. Here the first errors are statistical and the second systematic. This calculation is the first step in determining the more challenging, two-photon-mediated decay amplitude that contributes to the rare decay $K\\toμ^+μ^-$.",

The approach is implemented for the two-flavor lattice Schwinger model near the critical point. In this system, neural-network preconditioners are found to accelerate the convergence of the conjugate gradient solver compared with the solution of unpreconditioned systems or those preconditioned with conventional approaches based on even-odd or incomplete Cholesky decompositions, as measured by reductions in the number of iterations and/or complex operations required for convergence. It is also shown that a preconditioner trained on ensembles with small lattice volumes can be used to construct preconditioners for ensembles with many times larger lattice volumes, with minimal degradation of performance. This volume-transferring technique amortizes the training cost and presents a pathway towards scaling such preconditioners to lattice field theory calculations with larger lattice volumes and in four dimensions.",

      "summary": "We present lattice QCD calculations of valence parton distribution function (PDF) of pion employing next-to-next-leading-order (NNLO) perturbative QCD matching. Our calculations are based on three gauge ensembles of 2+1 flavor highly improved staggered quarks and Wilson--Clover valance quarks, corresponding to pion mass $m_π=140$~MeV at a lattice spacing $a=0.076$~fm and $m_π=300$~MeV at $a=0.04, 0.06$~fm. This enables us to present, for the first time, continuum-extrapolated lattice QCD results for NNLO valence PDF of the pion at the physical point. Applying leading-twist expansion for renormalization group invariant (RGI) ratios of bi-local pion matrix elements with NNLO Wilson coefficients we extract $2^{\\mathrm{nd}}$, $4^{\\mathrm{th}}$ and $6^{\\mathrm{th}}$ Mellin moments of the PDF. We reconstruct the Bjorken-$x$ dependence of the NNLO PDF from real-space RGI ratios using a deep neural network (DNN) as well as from momentum-space matrix elements renormalized using a hybrid-scheme. All our results are in broad agreement with the results of global fits to the experimental data carried out by the xFitter and JAM collaborations.",

      "summary": "We present the nonperturbatively renormalized nucleon gluon momentum fraction using ensembles with $2+1+1$ flavors of highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ), generated by MILC Collaboration. The calculation is done using clover fermions for the valence action with three pion masses, $220$, $310$ and $690$ MeV and three lattice spacings, 0.09, 0.12, and 0.15 fm. The renormalization is done using RI/MOM nonperturbative renormalization and using cluster-decomposition error reduction (CDER) to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the renormalization constant. We find the CDER technique is particularly important to improve the signal at the finer lattice ensembles where the lattice volume is larger. We extrapolate the gluon momentum fraction to the continuum-physical limit and obtain $\\langle x \\rangle_g = 0.492(52)_\\text{stat.+NPR}(49)_\\text{mixing}$ in the $\\bar{\\text{MS}}$ scheme at 2 GeV, where first error includes the statistical error and uncertainties in nonperturbative renormalization, while the latter systematic accounts for ignoring quark mixing.

At fixed volume the model contains a discrete Einstein-Hilbert term with coupling $κ$ and local measure term with coupling $β$ that weights triangulations according to the number of simplices sharing each vertex. We map out the phase diagram in this two dimensional parameter space and compute a variety of observables that yield information on the nature of any continuum limit. Our results are consistent with a line of first order phase transitions with a latent heat that decreases as $κ\\to\\infty$. We find a Hausdorff dimension along the critical line that approaches $D_H=4$ for large $κ$ and a spectral dimension that is consistent with $D_s=\\frac{3}{2}$ at short distances. These results are broadly in agreement with earlier works on Euclidean dynamical triangulation models which utilize degenerate triangulations and/or different measure terms and indicate that such models exhibit a degree of universality.",

We investigate how the choice of such a mapping interacts with the underlying qubit connectivity of the quantum processor to enable (or impede) parallelization of the resulting Hamiltonian-simulation algorithm. It is shown that this problem can be mapped to a path coloring problem on a graph constructed from the particular choice of encoding fermions onto qubits and the fermionic interactions onto paths. The basic version of this problem is called the weak coloring problem. Taking into account the fine-grained details of the mapping yields what is called the strong coloring problem, which leads to improved parallelization performance. A variety of illustrative analytical and numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the amount of improvement for both weak and strong coloring-based parallelizations. Our results are particularly important for implementation on near-term quantum processors where minimizing circuit depth is necessary for algorithmic feasibility.",

      "summary": "We present results for the scalar and tensor isovector-couplings ($g_S$ and $g_T$) of the nucleon measured at the physical point ($M_π=135$ MeV) with a single lattice spacing of $0.085\\ \\mathrm{fm}$ in 2+1 flavor QCD. Our calculations are carried out with two ensembles of gauge configurations generated by the PACS Collaboration with nonperturbatively ${\\cal O}(a)$ improved Wilson quark action and Iwasaki gauge action on $(10.9\\ {\\rm fm})^4$ and $(5.5\\ {\\rm fm})^4$ lattices, where the finite-size effect on the nucleon mass was not shown at the level of the statistical precision less than 0.5%. We compute the nucleon three-point correlation functions in the vector, axial, scalar, and tensor channels. We confirm that our previous result of the nucleon axial coupling on the large spatial volume of $(10.9\\ {\\rm fm})^4$ has no finite-size effect at the level of the statistical precision of 1.9%. For the renormalization, we first renormalize $g_S$ and $g_T$ nonperturbatively using the RI/SMOM$_{(γ_μ)}$ scheme, a variant of Rome-Southampton RI/MOM scheme with reduced systematic errors, as the intermediate scheme. We evaluate our final results at the renormalization scale of 2 GeV in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme through matching procedure between the RI/SMOM$_{(γ_μ)}$ and $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ schemes with the help of perturbation theory, and then obtain $g_S=0.927(71)_{\\rm stat}(22)_{\\rm syst}$ and $g_T=1.036(6)_{\\rm stat}(20)_{\\rm syst}$.",

      "title": "Improved renormalization scheme for nonlocal operators",
      "summary": "In this paper we present an improved RI-type prescription appropriate for the non-perturbative renormalization of gauge invariant nonlocal operators. In this prescription, the non-perturbative vertex function is improved by subtracting unwanted finite lattice spacing ($a$) effects, calculated in lattice perturbation theory. The method is versatile and can be applied to a wide range of fermion and gluon actions, as well as types of nonlocal operators. The presence of operator mixing can also be accommodated.\n  Compared to the standard RI' prescription, this variant can be recast as a supplementary finite renormalization, whose coefficients bring about corrections of higher order in $a$; consequently, it coincides with standard RI' as $a\\to 0$, however it can afford us a smoother and more controlled extrapolation to the continuum limit.\n  In this proof-of-concept calculation we focus on nonlocal fermion bilinear operators containing a straight Wilson line. In the numerical implementation we use Wilson/clover fermions and Iwasaki improved gluons. The finite-$a$ terms were calculated to one-loop level in lattice perturbation theory, and to all orders in $a$, using the same action as the non-perturbative vertex functions. We find that the method leads to significant improvement in the perturbative region indicated by small and intermediate values of the length of the Wilson line. This results in a robust extraction of the renormalization functions in that region.\n  We have also applied the above method to operators with stout-smeared links. We show how to perform the perturbative correction for any number of smearing iterations, and evaluate its effect on the power divergent renormalization coefficients.",

The Ioffe-time pseudo-distribution provides a frame-independent and gauge-invariant framework to determine the gluon helicity in the nucleon from first principles. We employ a high-statistics computation using a $32^3\\times 64$ lattice ensemble characterized by a $358$ MeV pion mass and a $0.094$ fm lattice spacing. We establish the pseudo-distribution approach as a feasible method to address the proton spin puzzle with successive improvements in statistical and systematic uncertainties anticipated in the future. Within the statistical precision of our data, we find a good comparison between the lattice determined polarized gluon Ioffe-time distribution and the corresponding expectations from the state-of-the-art global analyses. We find a hint for a nonzero gluon spin contribution to the proton spin from the model-independent extraction of the gluon helicity pseudo-distribution over a range of Ioffe-time, $ν\\lesssim 9$.",

With some general assumptions, we argue that the induced confinement scale will be significantly enhanced near the edge of the conformal to confining transition. This enhancement can allow for the fermion mass to be arbitrarily small compared to the confinement scale. This scale separation may allow for apparent spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry within the conformal window, which may be of interest for construction of dilaton effective field theories in this regime.",

      "summary": "An accurate determination of the leading-order hadronic vacuum polarisation (HVP) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is critical to understanding the size and significance of any discrepancy between the Standard Model prediction and experimental results being obtained by the Muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab. The Standard Model prediction is currently based on a data-driven approach to the HVP using experimental results for $σ(e^+e^-\\rightarrow\\,\\mathrm{hadrons})$. Lattice QCD aims to provide a result with similar uncertainty from calculated vector-vector correlation functions, but the growth of statistical and systematic errors in the $u/d$ quark correlation functions at large Euclidean time has made this difficult to achieve. We show that restricting the lattice contributions to a one-sided window $0<t<t_1$ can greatly improve lattice results while still capturing a large fraction of the total HVP. We illustrate this by comparing windowed lattice results based on the 2019 Fermilab Lattice/HPQCD/MILC HVP analysis with corresponding results obtained from the KNT19 analysis of $R_{e^+e^-}$ data. For $t_1=1.5$ fm, 70% of the total HVP is contained within the window and our lattice result has an error of~0.7%, only about twice as big as the error from the $e^+e^-$~analysis. We see a tension of 2.7$σ$ between the two results. With increased statistics in the lattice data the one-sided windows will allow stringent tests of lattice and $R_{e^+e^-}$ results that include a large fraction of the total HVP contribution.",

      "summary": "We present the first theoretical prediction of the production rate of $1^{-+}$ light hybrid meson $η_1$ in $J/ψ$ radiative decays. In the $N_f=2$ lattice QCD formalism with the pion mass $m_π\\approx 350$ MeV, the related electromagnetic multipole form factors are extracted from the three-point functions that involve necessarily quark annihilation diagrams, which are calculated through the distillation method. The partial width of $J/ψ\\to γη_1$ is determined to be $2.29(77)~\\mathrm{eV}$ at the $η_1$ mass $m_{η_1}=2.23(4)$ GeV. If $η_1$ corresponds to the recently observed $η_1(1855)$ in the process $J/ψ\\to γη_1(1855)\\to γηη'$ by BESIII, then the branching fraction $\\mathrm{Br}(J/ψ\\to γη_1(1855))$ is estimated to be $6.2(2.2)\\times 10^{-5}$, which implies $\\mathrm{Br}(η_1(1855)\\to ηη')\\sim 4.3\\%$.",

      "summary": "Tools necessary for quantum simulations of $1+1$ dimensional quantum chromodynamics are developed. When formulated in axial gauge and with two flavors of quarks, this system requires 12 qubits per spatial site with the gauge fields included via non-local interactions. Classical computations and D-Wave's quantum annealer Advantage are used to determine the hadronic spectrum, enabling a decomposition of the masses and a study of quark entanglement. Color edge states confined within a screening length of the end of the lattice are found. IBM's 7-qubit quantum computers, ibmq_jakarta and ibm_perth, are used to compute dynamics from the trivial vacuum in one-flavor QCD with one spatial site. More generally, the Hamiltonian and quantum circuits for time evolution of $1+1$ dimensional $SU(N_c)$ gauge theory with $N_f$ flavors of quarks are developed, and the resource requirements for large-scale quantum simulations are estimated.",

We also provide the couplings as well as further checks extrapolating partial-wave dispersion relations or with other continuation methods. A pole at $(1380^{+70}_{-60})-i\\,(220^{+80}_{-70})$ MeV also appears in the $ππ\\to K\\bar K$ data analysis with partial-wave dispersion relations. Despite settling its existence, our model-independent dispersive and analytic methods still show a lingering tension between pole parameters from the $ππ$ and $K\\bar K$ channels that should be attributed to data.",

Starting from a nonlocal meson--baryon effective chiral Lagrangian, we show how the introduction of a correlation function representing the finite extent of hadrons regularizes the meson loop integrals and introduces momentum dependence in vertex form factors in a gauge invariant manner. We apply the framework to the calculation of nucleon electromagnetic form factors, unpolarized and polarized parton distributions, as well as transverse momentum dependent distributions and generalized parton distributions. Assuming that the nonlocal behavior is a general property of all interactions, we also discuss the application to the lepton anomalous magnetic moment in nonlocal QED.",

      "summary": "Euclidean time windows in the integral representation of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon $g-2$ serve to test the consistency of lattice calculations and may help in tracing the origins of a potential tension between lattice and data-driven evaluations. In this paper, we present results for the intermediate time window observable computed using O($a$) improved Wilson fermions at six values of the lattice spacings below 0.1\\,fm and pion masses down to the physical value. Using two different sets of improvement coefficients in the definitions of the local and conserved vector currents, we perform a detailed scaling study which results in a fully controlled extrapolation to the continuum limit without any additional treatment of the data, except for the inclusion of finite-volume corrections. To determine the latter, we use a combination of the method of Hansen and Patella and the Meyer-Lellouch-Lüscher procedure employing the Gounaris-Sakurai parameterization for the pion form factor. We correct our results for isospin-breaking effects via the perturbative expansion of QCD+QED around the isosymmetric theory. Our result at the physical point is $a_μ^{\\mathrm{win}}=(237.30\\pm0.79_{\\rm stat}\\pm1.22_{\\rm syst})\\times10^{-10}$, where the systematic error includes an estimate of the uncertainty due to the quenched charm quark in our calculation. Our result displays a tension of 3.9$σ$ with a recent evaluation of $a_μ^{\\mathrm{win}}$ based on the data-driven method.",

      "summary": "The $S$-wave $DD^*$ scattering in the isospin $I=0,1$ channels is studied in $N_f=2$ lattice QCD at $m_π\\approx 350$ MeV. It is observed that the $DD^*$ interaction is repulsive in the $I=1$ channel when the $DD^*$ energy is near the $DD^*$ threshold. In contrast, the $DD^*$ interaction in the $I=0$ channel is definitely attractive in a wide range of the $DD^*$ energy. This is consistent with the isospin assignment $I=0$ for $T_{cc}^+(3875)$. By analyzing the components of the $DD^*$ correlation functions, it turns out that the quark diagram responsible for the different properties of $I=0,1$ $DD^*$ interactions can be understood as the charged $ρ$ meson exchange effect. This observation provides direct information on the internal dynamics of $T_{cc}^+(3875)$.",

Using the latest results on the variation of hadron masses as a function of the pion mass from lattice quantum chromodynamics, we study the temperature dependence of the renormalized chiral condensate in 2+1 flavor QCD. Furthermore, we suggest a better criterion to estimate of the pseudocritical temperature, which gives $T_c = 161.2 \\pm 1.7$ MeV, which is much improved compared to all the earlier results within the hadron resonance gas model or chiral perturbation theory. For the curvature of the pseudocritical line we find $κ_2 = 0.0203(7)$, which is in very good agreement with continuum extrapolated lattice results.",

      "title": "Static Energy in ($2+1+1$)-Flavor Lattice QCD: Scale Setting and Charm Effects",
      "summary": "We present results for the static energy in ($2+1+1$)-flavor QCD over a wide range of lattice spacings and several quark masses, including the physical quark mass, with ensembles of lattice-gauge-field configurations made available by the MILC Collaboration. We obtain results for the static energy out to distances of nearly $1$~fm, allowing us to perform a simultaneous determination of the scales $r_{1}$ and $r_{0}$, as well as the string tension $σ$. For the smallest three lattice spacings we also determine the scale $r_{2}$. Our results for $r_{0}/r_{1}$ and $r_{0}\\sqrtσ$ agree with published ($2+1$)-flavor results. However, our result for $r_{1}/r_{2}$ differs significantly from the value obtained in the ($2+1$)-flavor case, which is most likely due to the effect of the charm quark. We also report results for $r_{0}$, $r_{1}$, and $r_{2}$ in~fm, with the former two being slightly lower than published ($2+1$)-flavor results. We study in detail the effect of the charm quark on the static energy by comparing our results on the finest two lattices with the previously published ($2+1$)-flavor QCD results at similar lattice spacing. We find that for $r > 0.2$~fm our results on the static energy agree with the ($2+1$)-flavor result, implying the decoupling of the charm quark for these distances. For smaller distances, on the other hand, we find that the effect of the dynamical charm quark is noticeable. The lattice results agree well with the two-loop perturbative expression of the static energy incorporating finite charm mass effects. This is the first time that the decoupling of the charm quark is observed and quantitatively analyzed on lattice data of the static energy.",

      "summary": "The large radiative production rate for pseudoscalar mesons in the $J/ψ$ radiative decay remains elusive. We present the first lattice QCD calculation of partial decay width of $J/ψ$ radiatively decaying into $η_{(2)}$, the $\\mathrm{SU(2)}$ flavor singlet pseudoscalar meson, which confirms QCD $\\mathrm{U_A(1)}$ anomaly enhancement to the coupling of gluons with flavor singlet pseudoscalar mesons. The lattice simulation is carried out using $N_f=2$ lattice QCD gauge configurations at the pion mass $m_π \\approx 350$ MeV. In particular, the distillation method has been utilized to calculate light quark loops. The results are reported here with the mass $m_{η_{(2)}}= 718(8)$ MeV and the decay width $Γ(J/ψ\\toγη_{(2)})=0.385(45)$ keV. By assuming the dominance of $\\mathrm{U_A(1)}$ anomaly and flavor singlet-octet mixing angle $θ=-24.5^\\circ$, the production rates for the physical $η$ and $η'$ in $J/ψ$ radiative decay are predicted to be $1.15(14)\\times 10^{-3}$ and $4.49(53)\\times 10^{-3}$, respectively, which agree well with the experimental measurement data. Our study manifests the potential of lattice QCD studies on the light hadron production in $J/ψ$ radiative decays.",

The whole dataset of CT18 is used in this CT18CS fit. The impact of the recent SeaQuest data on the $\\bar{d}(x)-\\bar{u}(x)$ distribution of CT18CS is also discussed. The separate momentum fractions for the valence, the connected sea and disconnected sea of $u$ and $d$, the strange and the gluon partons are presented at $μ=1.3$ GeV for the first time.

We here show that the subtlety can be understood from the asymptotic expansion of the modified Bessel function, which has been discussed for path integral of compact variables in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. The essential ingredient for defining the appropriate continuum theory is the $i\\varepsilon$ prescription, and with the proper implementation of the $i\\varepsilon$ we show that the Wilson action can be used for the real-time path integrals. It is here important that the $i\\varepsilon$ should be implemented for both timelike and spacelike plaquettes. We also argue the reason why the $i\\varepsilon$ becomes required for the Wilson action from the Hamiltonian formalism. The $i\\varepsilon$ is needed to manifestly suppress the contributions from singular paths, for which the Wilson action can give different values from those of the actual continuum action.",

We perform a first systematic study of the renormalization property of the quasi-TMDPDFs by calculating the relevant matrix elements in a pion state at 5 lattice spacings ranging from 0.03 fm to 0.12 fm. We demonstrate that the square root of the Wilson loop combined with the short distance hadron matrix element provides a successful method to remove all ultraviolet divergences of the quasi-TMD operator, and thus provide the necessary justification to perform a continuum limit calculation of TMDPDFs. In contrast, the popular RI/MOM renormalization scheme fails to eliminate all linear divergences.",

      "summary": "Fractal-like structures of varying complexity are common in nature, and measure-based dimensions (Minkowski, Hausdorff) supply their basic geometric characterization. However, at the level of fundamental dynamics, which is quantum, structure does not enter via geometry of fixed sets but is encoded in probability distributions on associated spaces. The question then arises whether a robust notion of fractal measure-based dimension exists for structures represented in this way. Starting from effective number theory, we construct all counting-based schemes to select effective supports on collections of objects with probabilities and associate the effective counting dimension (ECD) with each. We then show that ECD is scheme-independent and, thus, a well-defined measure-based dimension with meaning analogous to the Minkowski dimension of fixed sets. In physics language, ECD characterizes probabilistic descriptions arising in a theory or model via discrete ``regularization''. For example, our analysis makes recent surprising results on effective spatial dimensions in quantum chromodynamics and Anderson models well founded. We discuss how to assess the reliability of regularization removals in practice and perform such analysis in the context of 3d Anderson criticality.",

      "summary": "Precise quantification of the structure of nucleons is one of the crucial aims of hadronic physics for the coming years. The expected progress related to ongoing and planned experiments should be accompanied by calculations of partonic distributions from lattice QCD. While key insights from the lattice are expected to come for distributions that are difficult to access experimentally, it is important that lattice QCD can reproduce the well-known unpolarized parton distribution functions (PDFs) with full control over systematic uncertainties. One of the novel methods for accessing the partonic $x$-dependence is the pseudo-distribution approach, which employs matrix elements of a spatially-extended nonlocal Wilson-line operator of length $z$. In this paper, we address the issue of discretization effects, related to the necessarily nonzero value of the lattice spacing $a$, which start at first order in $a$ as a result of the nonlocal operator. We use twisted mass fermions simulated at three values of the lattice spacing, at a pion mass of 370 MeV, and extract the continuum limit of isovector unpolarized PDFs. We also test, for the first time in the pseudo-distribution approach, the effects of the recently derived two-loop matching. Finally, we address the issue of the reliability of the extraction with respect to the maximal value of $z$.",

We propose a novel parametrization of the form factors in terms of orthonormal polynomials that diagonalizes the form factor contributions to the dispersive bounds. This is a generalization of the unitarity bounds developed for meson-to-meson form-factors. In contrast to ad-hoc parametrizations of these form factors, our parametrization provides a degree of control of the form-factor uncertainties at large hadronic recoil.

      "summary": "Theoretical particle physicists continue to push the envelope in both high performance computing and in managing and analyzing large data sets. For example, the goals of sub-percent accuracy in predictions of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) using large scale simulations of lattice QCD and in finding signals of rare events and new physics in exabytes of data produced by experiments at the high luminosity large hadron collider (LHC) require new tools beyond just developments in hardware. Machine learning and artificial intelligence offer the promise of dramatically reducing the computational cost and time. This chapter reviews selected areas where AI/ML tools could have a major impact, provides an overview of the challenges, and discusses how new ideas such as normalizing flows can speed up the generation of gauge configurations needed in lattice QCD calculations; the growth of ML in surrogate models and pattern matching to reduce the cost of event generators and in the analysis of experimental data; and in the search for viable vacua in the landscape of string theories. While such approaches transform aspects of particle theory into computational problems, and thus black boxes, we argue that physics-aware development of these tools combined with algorithms that ensure that the results are bias free will continue to require a deep understanding of the physics. We see this broader transformation as akin to formulating and extracting observables from simulations of lattice QCD, a numerical integration of the path integral formulation of QCD that nevertheless requires a deep understanding of the underlying quantum field theory, the standard model of particle physics and effective field theory methods.",

Regarding the $Z_N$ symmetric clock models as specific discretizations of the XY model, we compare those discretizations to ones from truncations of the tensor network formulation of the XY model based on a character expansion, and focus on the differences in their phase structure at low temperatures. We also divide the tensor network formulations into core and interaction tensors and show that the core tensor has the dominant influence on the phase structure. Lastly, we examine a perturbed form of the XY model that continuously interpolates between the XY and clock models. We examine the behavior of the additional phase transition caused by the perturbation as the magnitude of perturbation is taken to zero. We find that this additional transition has a non-zero critical temperature as the perturbation vanishes, suggesting that even small perturbations can have a significant effect on the phase structure of the theory.",

If the variance of an estimator of a particular quantity is formally infinite, or in practice very large compared to the square of the mean, then that quantity can not be reliably estimated using the given sampling procedure. There are multiple scenarios in which this occurs, including in Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics, and a particularly simple example is given by the Gross-Neveu model where Monte Carlo calculations involve the introduction of auxiliary bosonic variables through a Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation. Here, it is shown that the variances of HS estimators for classes of operators involving fermion fields are divergent in this model and an even simpler zero-dimensional analogue. To correctly estimate these observables, two alternative sampling methods are proposed and numerically investigated.",

      "summary": "The numerical sign problem is a major obstacle to the quantitative understanding of many important physical systems with first-principles calculations. Typical examples for such systems include finite-density QCD, strongly-correlated electron systems and frustrated spin systems, as well as the real-time dynamics of quantum systems. In this talk, we argue that the \"tempered Lefschetz thimble method\" (TLTM) [M. Fukuma and N. Umeda, arXiv:1703.00861] and its extension, the \"worldvolume tempered Lefschetz thimble method\" (WV-TLTM) [M. Fukuma and N. Matsumoto, arXiv:2012.08468], may be a reliable and versatile solution to the sign problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by exemplifying a successful application of WV-TLTM to the Stephanov model, which is an important toy model of finite-density QCD. We also discuss the computational scaling of WV-TLTM.",

      "summary": "We extend our previous work on the light-quark connected part, $a_μ^{\\rm HVP,lqc}$, of the leading order hadronic-vacuum-polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_μ$, using staggered fermions, in several directions. We have collected more statistics on ensembles with lattice spacings of $0.06$, $0.09$ and $0.12$ fm, and we added two new ensembles, both with lattice spacing $0.15$ fm, but with different volumes. The increased statistics allow us to reduce statistical errors on $a_μ^{\\rm HVP,lqc}$ and related window quantities significantly. We also calculate the current-current correlator from which $a_μ^{\\rm HVP,lqc}$ is obtained to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in staggered chiral perturbation theory, so that we can correct lattice values for $a_μ^{\\rm HVP,lqc}$ to NNLO for finite-volume, pion-mass mistuning and taste-breaking effects. We discuss the applicability of NNLO chiral perturbation theory to $a_μ^{\\rm HVP,lqc}$ and to the window quantities, emphasizing that it provides a systematic EFT approach to $a_μ^{\\rm HVP,lqc}$, but not to short- or intermediate-distance window quantities. This makes it difficult to assess systematic errors on the standard intermediate-distance window quantity that is now widely considered in the literature. In view of this, we investigate a longer-distance window, for which EFT methods should be more reliable. Our most important conclusion is that, especially for staggered fermions, new high-statistics computations at lattice spacings smaller than $0.06$ fm are indispensable.",

Our gauge field configurations from the MILC and RBC/UKQCD collaborations include sea quarks using either the domain wall or the HISQ action, respectively. The results show that RI/MOM and RI/SMOM can provide consistent renormalization constants to the $\\overline{\\textrm{MS}}$ scheme, after proper $a^2p^2$ extrapolations. But at $p\\sim 2$\\,GeV, both RI/MOM and RI/SMOM suffer from nonperturbative effects which cannot be removed by the perturbative matching. The comparison between the results with different sea actions also suggests that the renormalization constant is discernibly sensitive to the lattice spacing but not to the bare gauge coupling in the gauge action.",

      "summary": "We compute the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to the muon $g-2$ from the charm quark using lattice QCD. The calculation is performed on ensembles generated with dynamical $(u,d,s)$ quarks at the SU(3)$_{\\rm f}$ symmetric point with degenerate pion and kaon masses of around 415 MeV. It includes the connected charm contribution, as well as the leading disconnected Wick contraction, involving the correlation between a charm and a light-quark loop. Cutoff effects turn out to be sizeable, which leads us to use lighter-than-physical charm masses, to employ a broad range of lattice spacings reaching down to 0.039 fm and to perform a combined charm-mass and continuum extrapolation. We use the $η_c$ meson to define the physical charm-mass point and obtain a final value of $a_μ^{\\rm HLbL,c} = (2.8\\pm 0.5) \\times 10^{-11}$, whose uncertainty is dominated by the systematics of the extrapolation. Our result is consistent with the estimate based on a simple charm-quark loop, whilst being free of any perturbative scheme dependence on the charm mass. The mixed charm-light disconnected contraction contributes a small negative amount to the final value.",

The data set of measurement is obtained using the Oktay-Kronfeld (OK) action for the bottom quarks (valence quarks) and the HISQ action for the light quarks on the MILC HISQ lattices. We find that the old initial guess for the $χ^2$ minimizer in the fitting code is poor enough to slow down the analysis somewhat. In order to find a better initial guess, we adopt the Newton method. We find that the Newton method provides a natural test to check whether the $χ^2$ minimizer finds a local minimum or the global minimum, and it also reduces the number of iterations dramatically.",

      "summary": "The existence of a strongly coupled ultraviolet fixed point in 4-dimensional lattice models as they cross into the conformal window has long been hypothesized. The SU(3) gauge system with 8 fundamental fermions is a good candidate to study this phenomenon as it is expected to be very close to the opening of the conformal window. I study the system using staggered lattice fermions in the chiral limit. My numerical simulations employ improved lattice actions that include heavy Pauli-Villars (PV) type bosons. This modification does not affect the infrared dynamics but greatly reduces the ultraviolet fluctuations, thus allowing the study of stronger renormalized couplings than previously possible. I consider two different PV actions and find that both show an apparent continuous phase transition in the 8-flavor system.\n  I investigate the critical behavior using finite size scaling of the renormalized gradient flow coupling. The finite size scaling curve-collapse analysis predicts a first order phase transition consistent with discontinuity exponent $ν=1/4$ in the system without PV bosons. The scaling analysis with the PV boson actions is not consistent with a first order phase transition. The numerical data are well described by \"walking scaling\" corresponding to a renormalization group $β$ function that just touches zero, $β(g^2) \\sim (g^2 - g^2_\\star)^2$, though second order scaling cannot be excluded. Walking scaling could imply that the 8-flavor system is the opening of the conformal window, an exciting possibility that could be related to t'Hooft anomaly cancellation of the system.",

High-energy physicists have quickly identified problems of importance to our understanding of nature at the most fundamental level, from tiniest distances to cosmological extents, that are intractable with classical computers but may benefit from quantum advantage. They have initiated, and continue to carry out, a vigorous program in theory, algorithm, and hardware co-design for simulations of relevance to the HEP mission.

Two 2+1 flavor RBC/UKQCD ensembles use domain wall fermions (DWF) and Iwasaki gauge actions at $a = 0.084$ and 0.114 fm, and two 2+1+1 flavor MILC ensembles use the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) and Symanzik gauge actions at $a = 0.088$ and 0.121 fm. We have incorporated infinite volume corrections from 3 additional DWF ensembles at ${\\rm L}$ = 4.8, 6.4 and 9.6 fm and physical pion mass. For $a^{\\rm W}_{{\\rm con}, l}$, we find that our results on the two smaller lattice spacings are consistent with those using the unitary setup, but those at the two coarser lattice spacings are slightly different. Eventually, we predict $a^{\\rm W}_{{\\rm con}, l}=206.7(1.5)(1.0)$ and $a^{\\rm W}_{{\\rm con}, s}=26.8(0.1)(0.3)$, using linear extrapolation in $a^2$, with systematic uncertainties estimated from the difference of the central values from the RBC/UKQCD and MILC ensembles.",

By including both experimental and lattice QCD data, our analysis rigorously quantifies both the uncertainties of the pion PDFs and systematic effects intrinsic to the lattice QCD observables. The reduced Ioffe time pseudo-distributions significantly decrease the uncertainties on the PDFs, while the current-current correlators are limited by the systematic effects associated with the lattice. Consistent with recent phenomenological determinations, the behavior of the valence quark distribution of the pion at large momentum fraction is found to be $\\sim (1-x)^{ β_{\\rm eff}}$ with $β_{\\rm eff} \\approx 1.0-1.2$.",

We first obtain the quasi TMD wave functions at three different meson momenta on a lattice with valence clover quarks on a dynamical HISQ sea and lattice spacing $a=0.12$~fm from MILC, and renormalize the pertinent linear divergences using Wilson loops. Through one-loop matching to the light-cone wave functions, we determine the Collins-Soper kernel with transverse separation up to 0.6~fm. We study the systematic uncertainties from operator mixing and scale dependence, as well as the impact from higher power corrections. Our results potentially allow for a determination of the soft function and other transverse-momentum dependent quantities at one-loop accuracy.",

      "summary": "The search for new physics requires a joint experimental and theoretical effort. Lattice QCD is already an essential tool for obtaining precise model-free theoretical predictions of the hadronic processes underlying many key experimental searches, such as those involving heavy flavor physics, the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, nucleon-neutrino scattering, and rare, second-order electroweak processes. As experimental measurements become more precise over the next decade, lattice QCD will play an increasing role in providing the needed matching theoretical precision. Achieving the needed precision requires simulations with lattices with substantially increased resolution. As we push to finer lattice spacing we encounter an array of new challenges. They include algorithmic and software-engineering challenges, challenges in computer technology and design, and challenges in maintaining the necessary human resources. In this white paper we describe those challenges and discuss ways they are being dealt with. Overcoming them is key to supporting the community effort required to deliver the needed theoretical support for experiments in the coming decade.",

In this paper, we review the derivation of Overlap fermion formalism in a torus of three space-time dimensions. Using the formalism, we show how to use the Overlap fermion determinants in the massless and infinite mass limits to construct different continuum topological gauge actions, such as the level-$k$ Chern-Simons action, ``half-CS\" term and the mixed Chern-Simons (BF) coupling, in a gauge-invariant lattice UV regulated manner. Taking special Abelian and non-Abelian background fields, we demonstrate numerically how the lattice formalism beautifully reproduces the continuum expectations, such as the flow of action under large gauge transformations.",

      "summary": "New tests are applied to two $β$-functions of the much-discussed BSM model with ten massless fermion flavors in the fundamental representation of the SU(3) color gauge group. The renormalization scheme of the two $β$-functions is defined on the gauge field gradient flow in respective finite or infinite physical volumes at zero lattice spacing. Recently published results in the ten-flavor theory led to indicators of an infrared fixed point (IRFP) in the finite-volume step $β$-function in the strong coupling regime of the theory arXiv:2004.00754. We analyze our substantially extended set of ten-flavor lattice ensembles at strong renormalized gauge couplings and find no evidence or hint for IRFP in the finite-volume step $β$-function within controlled lattice reach. We also discuss new ten-flavor tests of the recently introduced lattice definition and algorithmic implementation of the $β$-function defined on the gradient flow of the gauge field over infinite Euclidean space-time in the continuum. Originally we introduced this new algorithm to match finite-volume step $β$-functions in massless near-conformal gauge theories with the infinite-volume $β$-function reached in the chiral limit from small fermion mass deformations of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking.\n  Results from the lattice analysis of the ten-flavor infinite-volume $β$-function are consistent with the absence of IRFP from our step $β$-function based analysis. We make important contact at weak coupling in infinite volume with gradient flow based three-loop perturbation theory, serving as a first pilot study toward the long-term goal of developing alternate approach to the determination of the strong coupling $α_s$ at the Z-boson pole in QCD.",

      "summary": "We summarize recent evidence, both from lattice QCD and chiral perturbation theory, that suggests that larger-than-expected excited-state contamination could be the reason for the tension between phenomenological determinations and previous direct lattice-QCD calculations of the pion--nucleon sigma term $σ_{πN}$. In addition, we extend the $χ$PT analysis by calculating the corrections due to including the $Δ(1232)$ resonance as an explicit degree of freedom. This correction is found to be small, thereby corroborating the excited-state effects found in the $Δ$-less calculation and the result for $σ_{πN}$.",

      "title": "Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay: A Roadmap for Matching Theory to Experiment",
      "summary": "The observation of neutrino oscillations and hence non-zero neutrino masses provided a milestone in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model. But even though we now know that neutrinos are massive, the nature of neutrino masses, i.e., whether they are Dirac or Majorana, remains an open question. A smoking-gun signature of Majorana neutrinos is the observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay, a process that violates the lepton-number conservation of the Standard Model. This white paper focuses on the theoretical aspects of the neutrinoless double-beta decay program and lays out a roadmap for future developments. The roadmap is a multi-scale path starting from high-energy models of neutrinoless double-beta decay all the way to the low-energy nuclear many-body problem that needs to be solved to supplement measurements of the decay rate. The path goes through a systematic effective-field-theory description of the underlying processes at various scales and needs to be supplemented by lattice quantum chromodynamics input. The white paper also discusses the interplay between neutrinoless double-beta decay, experiments at the Large Hadron Collider and results from astrophysics and cosmology in probing simplified models of lepton-number violation at the TeV scale, and the generation of the matter-antimatter asymmetry via leptogenesis. This white paper is prepared for the topical groups TF11 (Theory of Neutrino Physics), TF05 (Lattice Gauge Theory), RF04 (Baryon and Lepton Number Violating Processes), NF03 (Beyond the Standard Model) and NF05 (Neutrino Properties) within the Theory Frontier, Rare Processes and Precision Frontier, and Neutrino Physics Frontier of the U.S. Community Study on the Future of Particle Physics (Snowmass 2021).",

      "summary": "In the Kogut-Susskind formulation of lattice gauge theories, a set of quantum numbers resides at the ends of each link to characterize the vertex-local gauge field. We discuss the role of these quantum numbers in propagating correlations and supporting entanglement that ensures each vertex remains gauge invariant, despite time evolution induced by operators with (only) partial access to each vertex Hilbert space. Applied to recent proposals for eliminating vertex-local Hilbert spaces in quantum simulation, we describe how the required entanglement is generated via delocalization of the time evolution operator with nearest-neighbor controls. These hybridizations, organized with qudits or qubits, exchange classical operator preprocessing for reductions in quantum resource requirements that extend throughout the lattice volume.",

They provide important tests of the standard model at both first and second order in the Fermi constant $G_F$ and offer a window into possible new phenomena at energies as high as 1,000 TeV. These possibilities become even more compelling as the growing capabilities of lattice QCD make high-precision standard model predictions possible. Here we discuss and attempt to forecast some of these capabilities.",

      "summary": "Maximizing the discovery potential of increasingly precise neutrino experiments will require an improved theoretical understanding of neutrino-nucleus cross sections over a wide range of energies. Low-energy interactions are needed to reconstruct the energies of astrophysical neutrinos from supernovae bursts and search for new physics using increasingly precise measurement of coherent elastic neutrino scattering. Higher-energy interactions involve a variety of reaction mechanisms including quasi-elastic scattering, resonance production, and deep inelastic scattering that must all be included to reliably predict cross sections for energies relevant to DUNE and other accelerator neutrino experiments. This white paper discusses the theoretical status, challenges, required resources, and path forward for achieving precise predictions of neutrino-nucleus scattering and emphasizes the need for a coordinated theoretical effort involved lattice QCD, nuclear effective theories, phenomenological models of the transition region, and event generators.",

      "summary": "Theoretical predictions for particle production cross sections and decays at colliders rely heavily on perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) calculations, expressed as an expansion in powers of the strong coupling constant $α_s$. The current $\\mathcal{O}(1\\%)$ uncertainty of the QCD coupling evaluated at the reference Z boson mass, $α_s(m_Z) = 0.1179 \\pm 0.0009$, is one of the limiting factors to more precisely describe multiple processes at current and future colliders. A reduction of this uncertainty is thus a prerequisite to perform precision tests of the Standard Model as well as searches for new physics. This report provides a comprehensive summary of the state-of-the-art, challenges, and prospects in the experimental and theoretical study of the strong coupling. The current $α_s(m_Z)$ world average is derived from a combination of seven categories of observables: (i) lattice QCD, (ii) hadronic $τ$ decays, (iii) deep-inelastic scattering and parton distribution functions fits, (iv) electroweak boson decays, hadronic final-states in (v) $e^+e^-$, (vi) e-p, and (vii) p-p collisions, and (viii) quarkonia decays and masses. We review the current status of each of these seven $α_s(m_Z)$ extraction methods, discuss novel $α_s$ determinations, and examine the averaging method used to obtain the world-average value. Each of the methods discussed provides a ``wish list'' of experimental and theoretical developments required in order to achieve the goal of a per-mille precision on $α_s(m_Z)$ within the next decade.",

The hadronic proton to meson plus octet or decuplet baryon splitting functions are derived at the one-loop level, with loop integrals rendered finite by correlation functions introduced in the nonlocal Lagrangian. Within the convolution framework, the proton strange helicity distribution is obtained using spin-flavor symmetry to constrain the input valence quark distributions in the hadronic intermediate states. The polarized strange quark distribution is found to be quite small, with the lowest moment of $Δs$ negative, but consistent with recent global QCD analyses.",

      "summary": "The exponentially falling signal-to-noise ratio in all nucleon correlation functions, and the presence of towers of multihadron excited states with relatively small mass gaps makes extraction of matrix elements of various operators within the ground state nucleon challenging. Theoretically, the allowed positive parity states with the smallest mass gaps are the $N(\\bm p)π(-\\bm p)$, $N(\\bm 0)π(\\bm 0)π(\\bm 0)$, $N(\\bm p)π(\\bm 0)$, $N(\\bm 0)π(\\bm p),\\ \\ldots$, states. A priori, the contribution of these states arises at one loop in chiral perturbation theory ($χ$PT), however, in many cases the contributions are enhanced. In this talk, I will review four such cases: the correlation functions from which the axial form factors, electric and magnetic form factors, the $Θ$-term contribution to neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM), and the pion-nucleon sigma term are extracted. Including appropriate multihadron states in the analysis can lead to significantly different results compared to standard analyses with the mass gaps taken from fits to 2-point functions. The $χ$PT case for $N π$ states is the most clear in the axial/pseudoscalar form factors which need to satisfy the PCAC relation between them. Our analyses, supported by $χ$PT, suggests similarly large effects in the calculations of the $Θ$-term and the pion-nucleon sigma term that have significant phenomenological implications.",

We discuss the impact of tensor network methods on lattice field theory, quantum gravity and QIS in the context of High Energy Physics (HEP). These tools will target calculations for strongly interacting systems that are made difficult by sign problems when conventional Monte Carlo and other importance sampling methods are used. Further development of methods and software will be needed to make a significant impact in HEP. We discuss the roadmap to perform quantum chromodynamics (QCD) related calculations in the coming years. The research is labor intensive and requires state of the art computational science and computer science input for its development and validation.

      "summary": "Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories for the foreseeable future will be hampered by limited resources. The historical success of improved lattice actions in classical simulations strongly suggests that Hamiltonians with improved discretization errors will reduce quantum resources, i.e. require $\\gtrsim 2^d$ fewer qubits in quantum simulations for lattices with $d$ spatial dimensions. In this work, we consider $\\mathcal{O}(a^2)$-improved Hamiltonians for pure gauge theories and design the corresponding quantum circuits for its real-time evolution in terms of primitive gates. An explicit demonstration for $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory is presented including exploratory tests using the ibm_perth device.",

Schemes based on discrete subgroups use a smaller, fixed number of qubits at the cost of systematic errors. We systematize this approach by deriving the single plaquette action through matching the continuous group action to that of a discrete one via group character expansions modulo the field fluctuation contributions. We accompany this scheme by simulations of pure gauge over the largest discrete crystal-like subgroup of $SU(3)$ up to the fifth-order in the coupling constant.",

      "summary": "Emerging sampling algorithms based on normalizing flows have the potential to solve ergodicity problems in lattice calculations. Furthermore, it has been noted that flows can be used to compute thermodynamic quantities which are difficult to access with traditional methods. This suggests that they are also applicable to the density-of-states approach to complex action problems. In particular, flow-based sampling may be used to compute the density directly, in contradistinction to the conventional strategy of reconstructing it via measuring and integrating the derivative of its logarithm. By circumventing this procedure, the accumulation of errors from the numerical integration is avoided completely and the overall normalization factor can be determined explicitly. In this proof-of-principle study, we demonstrate our method in the context of two-component scalar field theory where the $O(2)$ symmetry is explicitly broken by an imaginary external field. First, we concentrate on the zero-dimensional case which can be solved exactly. We show that with our method, the Lee-Yang zeroes of the associated partition function can be successfully located. Subsequently, we confirm that the flow-based approach correctly reproduces the density computed with conventional methods in one- and two-dimensional models.",

The Kluberg-Stern method to construct staggered bilinear operators conserves continuum property such as recursion relations, uniqueness of chirality, and Ward identities, which leads to a unique and characteristic pattern (we call it \"leakage pattern (LP)\") in the matrix elements of the chirality operator sandwiched between two quark eigenstates of staggered Dirac operator. DL analysis gives $99.4(2)\\%$ accuracy on normal gauge configurations and $0.998$ AUC (Area Under ROC Curve) for classifying non-zero mode octets in the Dirac eigenvalue spectrum. It confirms that the leakage pattern is universal on normal gauge configurations. The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) method turns out to be the best DL model for our study on the LP.",

Smaller corrections, comparable to anticipated experimental precision, impact the $β$-$ν$ angular correlations and the $β$-asymmetry.

      "summary": "Using high statistics datasets generated in (2+1)-flavor QCD calculations at finite temperature we present results for low order cumulants of net baryon-number fluctuations at non-zero values of the baryon chemical potential. We calculate Taylor expansions for the pressure (zeroth order cumulant), net baryon-number density (first order cumulant) and the variance of the distribution on net-baryon number fluctuations (second order cumulant). We obtain series expansions from an eighth order expansion of the pressure and compare these to diagonal Padé approximants. This allows us to estimate the range of values for the baryon chemical potential in which these expansions are reliable. We find $μ_B/T\\le 2.5$, $2.0$ and $1.5$ for the zeroth, first and second order cumulants, respectively. We furthermore, construct estimators for the radius of convergence of the Taylor series of the pressure. In the vicinity of the pseudo-critical temperature, $T_{pc}\\simeq 156.5$ MeV, we find $μ_B/T \\gtrsim\\ 2.9$ at vanishing strangeness chemical potential and somewhat larger values for strangeness neutral matter. These estimates are temperature dependent and range from $μ_B/T \\gtrsim\\ 2.2$ at $T=135$ MeV to $μ_B/T\\ \\gtrsim\\ 3.2$ at $T=165$ MeV. The estimated radius of convergences is the same for any higher order cumulant.",

      "summary": "In this document, we summarize the status and challenges of calculating parton physics in lattice QCD for the US Particle Physics Community Planning Exercise (a.k.a. \"Snowmass\"). While PDF-moments calculations have been very successful and been continuously improved, new methods have been developed to calculate distributions directly in $x$-space. Many recent lattice studies have been focused on calculating isovector PDFs of the pion and nucleon, learning to control systematics associated with excited-state contamination, renormalization and continuum extrapolations, pion-mass and finite-volume effects, etc. Although in some cases, the lattice results are already competitive with experimental data, to reach the level of precision in a wide range of $x$ for unpolarized nucleon PDFs impactful for future collider physics remains a challenge, and may require exascale supercomputing power. The new theoretical methods open the door for calculating other partonic observables which will be the focus of the experimental program in nuclear physics, including generalized parton distributions and transverse-momentum dependent PDFs. A fruitful interplay between experimental data and lattice-QCD calculations will usher in a new era for parton physics and hadron structure.",

      "summary": "Finite-volume pionless effective field theory provides an efficient framework for the extrapolation of nuclear spectra and matrix elements calculated at finite volume in lattice QCD to infinite volume, and to nuclei with larger atomic number. In this work, it is demonstrated how this framework may be implemented via a set of correlated Gaussian wavefunctions optimised using differentiable programming and via solution of a generalised eigenvalue problem. This approach is shown to be significantly more efficient than a stochastic implementation of the variational method based on the same form of correlated Gaussian wavefunctions, yielding comparably accurate representations of the ground-state wavefunctions with an order of magnitude fewer terms. The efficiency of representation allows such calculations to be extended to larger systems than in previous work. The method is demonstrated through calculations of the binding energies of nuclei with atomic number $A\\in\\{2,3,4\\}$ in finite volume, matched to lattice QCD calculations at quark masses corresponding to $m_π=806$ MeV, and infinite-volume effective field theory calculations of $A\\in\\{2,3,4,5,6\\}$ systems based on this matching.",

      "summary": "We derive the on-shell form of amplitudes containing two external currents with a single hadron in the initial state and two hadrons in the final state, denoted as $1+\\mathcal{J}\\to 2+\\mathcal{J}$. This class of amplitude is relevant in precision tests of the Standard Model as well as for exploring the structure of excited states in the QCD spectrum. We present a model-independent description of the amplitudes where we sum to all orders in the strong interaction. From this analytic form we are able to extract transition and elastic resonance form factors consistent with previous work as well as a novel Compton-like amplitude coupling a single particle state to a resonance. The results also hold for reactions where the one-particle state is replaced with the vacuum, namely $\\mathcal{J}\\to 2+\\mathcal{J}$ amplitudes. We also investigate constraints placed upon the formalism for the case of a conserved vector current in the form of the Ward-Takahashi identity. The formalism presented here is valid for currents of arbitrary Lorentz structure and quantum numbers with spinless hadrons where any number of two-particle intermediate channels may be open. When combined with the appropriate finite-volume framework, this work facilitates the extraction of physical observables from this class of amplitudes via lattice QCD calculations.",

      "summary": "We present preliminary results for the axial, scalar and tensor charges of the nucleon measured in 2+1 flavor QCD with the physical light quarks ($m_π=135$ MeV). Our simulations are carried out with gauge configurations generated by the PACS Collaboration with the stout-smeared $O(a)$ improved Wilson fermions and Iwasaki gauge action at a single lattice spacing of $0.085\\ (\\mathrm{fm})$. There are two lattice ensembles of the PACS gauge configurations, which have physical lattice sizes over $(10\\ \\mathrm{fm})^4$ and $(5\\ \\mathrm{fm})^4$, respectively. We compute the nucleon three-point correlation functions in the axial, scalar, and tensor channels. For the renormalization, we use the Rome-Southampton method as the intermediate scheme in order to evaluate the renormalization constants for the scalar and tensor currents in fully nonperturbative manner. We then evaluate the renormalized values of the scalar and tensor charges ($g_S$ and $g_T$) in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme at the renormalization scale of 2 GeV with a help of the continuum perturbation theory for the matching between two schemes. We compare our preliminary results of $g_S$ and $g_T$ with those of other collaboration results.",

      "summary": "The Pomeron Regge trajectory underlies the dynamics dependence of hadronic total cross sections and diffractive reactions at high energies. The physics of the Pomeron is closely related to the gluon distribution function and the gluon gravitational form factor of the target hadron. In this article we examine the scale dependence of the nonperturbative gluon distribution in the nucleon and the pion which was derived in a previous article [Phys. Rev. D 104, 114005 (2021)] in the framework of holographic light-front QCD and the Veneziano model. We argue that the QCD evolution of the gluon distribution function $g(x,μ)$ to large $μ^2$ leads to a single scale-dependent Pomeron. The resulting Pomeron trajectory $α_P(t, μ)$ not only depends on the momentum transfer squared $t$, but also on the physical scale $μ$ of the amplitude, such as the virtuality $Q^2$ of the interacting photon in inclusive diffractive electroproduction. This can explain not only the $Q^2$ evolution of the proton structure function $F_2(x,Q^2)$ at small $x$, but also the observed energy and $Q^2$ dependence of high energy diffractive processes involving virtual photons up to LHC energies.",

We introduce a general correlator that includes as special cases these two Lattice TMDs and continuum TMDs, like the Collins scheme. Then, to facilitate the derivation of a factorization relation between lattice and continuum TMDs, we construct a new scheme, the Large Rapidity (LR) scheme, intermediate between the Collins and quasi-TMDs. The LR and Collins schemes differ only by an order of limits, and can be matched onto one another by a multiplicative kernel. We show that this same matching also holds between quasi and Collins TMDs, which enables us to prove a factorization relation between these quantities to all orders in $α_s$. Our results imply that there is no mixing between various quark flavors or gluons when matching Collins and quasi TMDs, making the lattice calculation of individual flavors and gluon TMDs easier than anticipated. We cross-check these results explicitly at one loop and discuss implications for other physical-to-lattice scheme factorizations.",

For the same error in determination of the mass, the qutrit simulations can tolerate 10 to 100x larger gate noise than a qubit simulations.

They are a new avenue for QCD calculations with Wilson-type fermions and we report results on our continued study of this framework: Tuning the clover improvement coefficient, and extending the reach of lattice spacings to $a=0.12$ fm. We fix the flavor symmetric points $m_π=m_K=412$ MeV at $a=0.055,0.064, 0.077, 0.094, 0.12$ fm and define the trajectories to the physical point by fixing the trace of the quark mass matrix. Currently our pion mass range extends down to $m_π\\sim200$ MeV. We outline our tuning goals and strategy as well as our future planned ensembles. First scaling studies are performed on $f_π$ and $m_π$. Additionally results of a preliminary continuum extrapolation of $m_N$ at the flavor symmetric point are presented. Going further a first determination of the light and strange hadron spectrum chiral dependence is shown, which serves to check the quality of the action for precision measurements. We also investigate other quantities such as flowed gauge observables to study how the continuum limit is approached. Taken together we observe the SWF enable us to perform stable lattice simulations across a large range of parameters in mass, volume and lattice spacing. Pooling resources our new initiative has made our reported progress possible and through it we will share generated gauge ensembles under an open science philosophy.",

      "summary": "The current precision reached by lattice QCD calculations of low-energy hadronic observables, requires not only the introduction of electromagnetic corrections, but also control over all the potential systematic uncertainties introduced by the lattice version of QED. Introducing a massive photon as an infrared regulator in lattice QED, provides a well defined theory, dubbed QEDM, amenable to numerical evaluation [arXiv:1507.08916]. The photon mass is removed through extrapolation. In this contribution we scrutinise aspects of QEDM such as the presence and fate of the zero modes contributions and we describe the determination of the photon mass corrections in finite and infinite volume. We demonstrate that the required extrapolations are well controlled using numerical data obtained on two ensembles which only differ in volume.",

      "summary": "A new quantum link microstructure was proposed for the lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) Hamiltonian, replacing the Wilson gauge links with a bilinear of fermionic qubits, later generalized to D-theory. This formalism provides a general framework for building lattice field theory algorithms for quantum computing. We focus mostly on the simplest case of a quantum rotor for a single compact $U(1)$ field. We also make some progress for non-Abelian setups, making it clear that the ideas developed in the $U(1)$ case extend to other groups. These in turn are building blocks for $1 + 0$-dimensional ($1 + 0$-D) matrix models, $1 + 1$-D sigma models and non-Abelian gauge theories in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. By introducing multiple flavors for the $U(1)$ field, where the flavor symmetry is gauged, we can efficiently approach the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of the quantum $O(2)$ rotor with increasing flavors. The emphasis of the method is on preserving the symplectic algebra exchanging fermionic qubits by sigma matrices (or hard bosons) and developing a formal strategy capable of generalization to $SU(3)$ field for lattice QCD and other non-Abelian $1 + 1$-D sigma models or $3 +3$-D gauge theories. For $U(1)$, we discuss briefly the qubit algorithms for the study of the discrete $1+1$-D Sine-Gordon equation.",

Alternatively, lattice QCD (LQCD) can be used to determine these interactions from the Standard Model with quantifiable theoretical uncertainties. Recent LQCD results of $g_{\\mathrm{A}}$ are in excellent agreement with data, and results for the (quasi-)elastic nucleon form factors with full uncertainty budgets are expected within a few years. We review the status of the field and LQCD results for the nucleon axial form factor, $F_{\\mathrm{A}}(Q^2)$, a major source of uncertainty in modeling sub-GeV neutrino-nucleon interactions. Results from different LQCD calculations are consistent, but collectively disagree with existing models, with potential implications for current and future neutrino oscillation experiments. We describe a road map to solidify confidence in the LQCD results and discuss future calculations of more complicated processes, important to few-GeV neutrino oscillation experiments.",

Currently $\\vert V_{us} \\vert$ is determined from the kaon decay widths and a lattice calculation of the associated form factor. In this proceeding, I will present preliminary work on a lattice determination of the hyperon mass spectrum. I will additionally summarize future goals in which we will calculate the hyperon transition matrix elements, which will provide an alternative means for accessing $\\vert V_{us} \\vert$. This work is based on a particular formulation of SU(2) chiral perturbation theory for hyperons; determining the extent to which this effective field theory converges is instrumental in understanding the limits of its predictive power, especially since some hyperonic observables are difficult to calculate near the physical pion mass (e.g., hyperon-to-nucleon form factors), and thus the use of heavier than physical pion masses is likely to yield more precise results when combined with extrapolations to the physical point.}",

We studied the QCD chiral transition at finite real baryon density with the more direct sign reweighting approach. We simulate up to a baryochemical potential-temperature ratio of $μ_B/T=2.7$, covering the RHIC Beam Energy Scan range, and penetrating the region where methods based on analytic continuation are unpredictive.This opens up a new window to study QCD matter at finite $μ_B$ from first principles.",

      "title": "Induced topological gravity and anomaly inflow from Kaehler-Dirac fermions in odd dimensions",
      "summary": "We show that the effective action that results from integrating out massive Kaehler-Dirac fermions propagating on a curved three dimensional space is a topological gravity theory of Chern-Simons type. In the presence of a domain wall, massless, two dimensional Kaehler-Dirac fermions appear that are localized to the wall. Potential gravitational anomalies arising for these domain wall fermions are cancelled via anomaly inflow from the bulk gravitational theory. We also study the invariance of the theory under large gauge transformations. The analysis and conclusions generalize straightforwardly to higher dimensions.",
