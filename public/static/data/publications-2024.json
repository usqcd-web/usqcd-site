      "title": "Collins-Soper Kernel in the QCD Instanton Vacuum",
      "summary": "We outline a general framework for evaluating the non-perturbative soft functions in the QCD instanton vacuum. In particular, from the soft function we derive the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel, which drives the rapidity evolution of the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions. The resulting CS kernel, when supplemented with the perturbative contribution, agrees well with recent lattice results and some phenomenological parameterizations. Moreover, our CS kernel depends logarithmically on the large quark transverse separation, providing a key constraint on its phenomenological parametrization. Finally, a lattice calculation can be directly compared to our generic results in Euclidean signature, thus providing a new approach for evaluating the soft function and extracting the CS kernel by analytical continuation.",

We also find that this tension disappears when we use the inclusive value of $|V_{cb}|$ obtained using the heavy quark expansion based on the QCD sum rule approach. We also report results for $|\\varepsilon_K|$ obtained using the Brod-Gorbahn-Stamou (BGS) method for $η_i$ of $u-t$ unitarity, which leads to even a stronger tension of $5.7σ\\sim 4.2σ$ with lattice QCD inputs.",

      "summary": "Lattice QCD is notorious for its computational expense. Modern lattice simulations require large-scale computational resources to handle the large number of Dirac operator inversions used to construct correlation functions. Machine learning (ML) techniques that can increase, at the analysis level, the information inferred from the correlation functions would therefore be beneficial. We apply supervised learning to infer two-point lattice correlation functions at different target masses. Our work proposes a new method for separating data into training and bias correction subsets for efficient uncertainty estimation. We also benchmark our ML models against a simple ratio method.",

Auxiliary directions will be completely factorized in the path integral, and the embedding does not alter the expectation values of the original theory. We perform the molecular dynamics updates by using the matrix elements of $W \\in M_N(\\mathbb{C})$ as the dynamical variables without group theoretic constraints.

      "summary": "We present results for the dominant light-quark connected contribution to the long-distance window (LD) of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution (HVP) to the muon $g-2$ from lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Specifically, with a new determination of the lattice scale on MILC's physical-mass HISQ ensembles, using the $Ω^-$ baryon mass, we obtain a result of $400.2(2.3)_{\\mathrm{stat}}(3.7)_{\\mathrm{syst}}[4.3]_{\\mathrm{total}} \\times 10^{-10}$. Summing this result with our recent determinations of the light-quark connected contributions to the short- (SD) and intermediate-distance (W) windows, we obtain a sub-percent precision determination of the light-quark-connected contribution to HVP of $655.5(2.3)_{\\mathrm{stat}}(3.9)_{\\mathrm{syst}}[4.5]_{\\mathrm{total}} \\times 10^{-10}$. Finally, as a consistency check, we verify that an independent analysis of the full contribution is in agreement with the sum of individual windows. We discuss our future plans for improvements of our HVP calculations to meet the target precision of the Fermilab $g-2$ experiment.",

Therefore, we pose the question of whether quantum computers can help us to study the Page curve and the black hole information dynamics, which has been a key focus in fundamental physics. In this regard, we rigorously examine the qubit transport model, a toy qubit model of black hole evaporation on IBM's superconducting quantum computers, to shed light on this question. Specifically, we implement the quantum simulation of the scrambling dynamics in black holes using an efficient random unitary circuit. Furthermore, we employ the swap-based many-body interference protocol and the randomized measurement protocol to measure the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation qubits in this model. Finally, by incorporating quantum error mitigation techniques into our challenging implementation of entanglement entropy measurement protocols on the IBM quantum hardware, we accurately determine the Rényi entropy in the qubit transport model, thus showcasing the utility of quantum computers for future investigations of complex quantum systems.",

      "summary": "A new dark matter candidate is proposed that arises as the lightest baryon from a confining $SU(N)$ gauge theory which equilibrates with the Standard Model only through electroweak interactions. Surprisingly, this candidate can be as light as a few GeV. The lower bound arises from the intersection of two competing requirements: i) the equilibration sector of the model must be sufficiently heavy, at least several TeV, to avoid bounds from colliders, and ii) the lightest dark meson (that may be the dark $η'$, $σ$, or the lightest glueball) has suppressed interactions with the SM, and must decay before BBN. The low energy dark sector consists of one flavor that is electrically neutral and an almost electroweak singlet. The dark matter candidate is the lightest baryon consisting of $N$ of these light flavors leading to a highly suppressed elastic scattering rate with the SM. The equilibration sector consists of vector-like dark quarks that transform under the electroweak group, ensuring that the dark sector can reach thermal equilibrium with the SM in the early Universe. The lightest dark meson lifetimes vary between $10^{-3} \\lesssim c τ\\lesssim 10^7$~meters, providing an outstanding target for LHC production and experimental detection. We delineate the interplay between the lifetime of the light mesons, the suppressed direct detection cross section of the lightest baryon, and the scale of equilibration sector that can be probed at the LHC.",

We present a method to achieve a Lorentz-covariant parameterization of the matrix elements in terms of a linearly independent basis of tensor structures. This parameterization is crucial for projecting lattice QCD matrix elements onto light cone distributions. For the first time, we determine the corresponding components that project onto the linear combinations of invariant amplitudes, which reduce to the different gluon GPDs in the light cone limit and enable their separation in a lattice QCD calculation for spin-$0$ and spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ hadrons. Hence, this work lays the foundation for the numerical determination of the gluon GPDs from first-principle lattice QCD calculations, directly advancing our understanding of the mass and spin structures and mechanical properties of the nucleon, as well as the physics underlying deeply virtual Compton scattering and deeply virtual meson production in a range of experimental processes.",

Our computation takes place in the region of the lattice that corresponds to the \"spacelike\" region in Minkowski space in order to obtain the Collins soft function. The matching of our result to the Collins soft function is achieved through the mapping of the auxiliary field directional vector that to the Wilson line rapidity. In Euclidean space, this directional vector is complex, having a purely imaginary time component. We present some exploratory numerical results of our lattice calculation, and discuss the methodology employed.",

      "summary": "Lattice simulations have observed a novel strong coupling symmetric mass generation (SMG) phase for the SU(3) gauge system with $N_f=8$ fundamental fermions (represented by two sets of staggered fields) at very large renormalized coupling ($g^2_{GF} \\gtrsim 25$). The results of Phys.Rev.D 106 (2022) 014513 suggest that the SMG phase is separated from the weak coupling, conformal phase by a continuous phase transition, implying that the SMG phase exists in the continuum limit. To scrutinize these findings, we are generating a set of large volume zero temperature ensembles using nHYP improved staggered fermions with additional Pauli-Villars fields to tame gauge field fluctuations. We consider the low-lying meson spectrum and verify the existence of the SMG phase. Based on a finite size scaling analysis we predict that the phase transition between the strong and weak coupling phases is likely governed by a merged fixed point that is ultraviolet in the strong coupling but infrared in the weak coupling side. This finding suggests that the SU(3) 8-flavor system sits at the opening of the conformal window",

This provides unique insights into long range correlations of field configurations across the confinement-deconfinement transition. Specifically, we analyze non-trivial structures in electric and magnetic field energy densities as well as Polyakov loop traces and a Polyakov loop-based variant of the topological density. The Betti curves for filtrations based on the electric and magnetic field energy densities reveal signals of electromagnetic dualities. These dualities can be associated with an interchange in the roles of local lumps of electric and magnetic energy densities around the phase transition. Moreover, we show that plaquette susceptibilities can manifest in the geometric features captured by the Betti curves. We also compare these findings against earlier results for $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and elaborate on the significant differences. Our results demonstrate that topological data analysis can identify clear differences between phase transitions of first and second order for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories and provides unprecedented insights into the relevant structures in their vicinity.",

      "summary": "Recent work introduced a new framework for analyzing correlation functions with improved convergence and signal-to-noise properties, as well as rigorous quantification of excited-state effects, based on the Lanczos algorithm and spurious eigenvalue filtering with the Cullum-Willoughby test. Here, we extend this framework to the analysis of correlation-function matrices built from multiple interpolating operators in lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) by constructing an oblique generalization of the block Lanczos algorithm, as well as a new physically motivated reformulation of the Cullum-Willoughby test that generalizes to block Lanczos straightforwardly. The resulting block Lanczos method directly extends generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) methods, which can be viewed as applying a single iteration of block Lanczos. Block Lanczos provides qualitative and quantitative advantages over GEVP methods analogous to the benefits of Lanczos over the standard effective mass, including faster convergence to ground- and excited-state energies, explicitly computable two-sided error bounds, straightforward extraction of matrix elements of external currents, and asymptotically constant signal-to-noise. No fits or statistical inference are required. Proof-of-principle calculations are performed for noiseless mock-data examples as well as two-by-two proton correlation-function matrices in lattice QCD.",

Using a trapped non-relativistic two-channel system as an example, a new relation is derived that retains the same structure as in the single channel, and has explicit dependence on the phase shifts in both channels but not on the inelasticity. The relation is illustrated by an exactly solvable coupled-channel quantum mechanical model with contact interactions. It is further validated by path integral Monte Carlo simulation of a quasi-one-dimensional model that can admit general interaction potentials. In all cases, we found rapid convergence to the infinite volume limit as the trap size is increased, even at short times, making it potentially a good candidate to overcome signal-to-noise issues in Monte Carlo applications.",

Additionally, the role of massless, flavor-neutral gluons on hadron mass formation is central to the unresolved Millennium Prize problem on the mass gap in Yang-Mills theory. Addressing these questions requires advanced simulations on state-of-the-art supercomputers using Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which offers a rigorous, non-perturbative definition of QCD solvable numerically. Here we present first-principles lattice QCD calculations using comprehensive gauge ensembles that accurately predict ground state spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 baryon masses with light, strange, and charm quarks within 1\\% of experimental values. At the \\(\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}\\) 2 GeV scale, our results unveil two fundamental mass generation mechanisms for those baryon masses in QCD: 1) the flavor-dependent enhancement of Higgs contributions, 4-8 for light, 2-3 for strange, and 1.2-1.3 for charm quarks; and 2) the flavor-insensitive contribution 0.8-1.2 GeV from gluon quantum anomaly. This breakthrough significantly advances our comprehension of strong interaction dynamics and the genesis of visible matter's mass.",

Our calculations are performed with the PACS10 gauge configurations generated by the PACS Collaboration with the six stout-smeared $O(a)$ improved Wilson-clover quark action and Iwasaki gauge action at $β$ = 1.82, 2.00 and 2.20 corresponding to lattice spacings of 0.09 fm (coarse), 0.06 fm (fine) and 0.04 fm (superfine), respectively. We first evaluate the value of the nucleon axial-vector coupling. In addition, the induced pseudoscalar and pion-nucleon couplings from the induced pseudoscalar form factor are also investigated. Combining the results obtained from the all of our coarse, fine and superfine lattices, we finally discuss the systematic uncertainties in our calculation based on the comparison with both of the experimental values and lattice QCD results provided by the other collaborations.",

      "summary": "In order to quantify the universal properties of the chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD, we make use of an improved, renormalized order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking which is obtained as a suitable difference of the $2$-flavor light quark chiral condensate and its corresponding light quark susceptibility. Having no additive ultraviolet as well as multiplicative logarithmic divergences, we use ratios of this order parameter constructed from its values for two different light quark masses. We show that this facilitates determining in a parameter-independent manner, the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ and the associated critical exponent $δ$ which, for sufficiently small values of the light quark masses, controls the quark mass dependence of the order parameter at $T_c$. We present first results of these calculations from our numerical analysis performed with staggered fermions on $N_τ=8$ lattices.",

The formalism is derived from the general principles of unitarity and analyticity, as encoded in the $N/D$ representation of a partial-wave two-body amplitude. The associated quantization condition relates the finite-volume spectrum to the infinite-volume numerator, $\\mathcal{N}$, used to reconstruct the scattering amplitude from dispersive relations.

      "summary": "Inclusive hadronic observables are ubiquitous in particle and nuclear physics. Computation of these observables using lattice QCD is challenging due the presence of a difficult inverse problem. As a stepping stone to more complicated observables, we report on progress to compute the smeared $R$~ratio with staggered quarks using the spectral reconstruction algorithm of Hansen, Lupo, and Tantalo. We compare staggered-quark results on two ensembles to domain-wall results on a single ensemble and to the Bernecker-Meyer parameterization. This work utilizes two ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration using highly improved staggered quarks and one ensemble generated by the RBC/UKQCD collaboration using domain-wall quarks. Possible strategies for controlling opposite-parity effects associated with staggered quarks are discussed.",

Our numerical results suggested that FTE$^2$ can be partitioned into an internal color entanglement entropy and a vibrational entropy corresponding to the transverse excitations of a QCD string, with the latter described by a thin string model. Since the color flux tube does not have transverse excitations in (1+1)D, we analytically compute the contribution of the internal color degrees of freedom to FTE$^2$ in this simpler framework. For the multipartite partitioning of the color flux tube, we find the remarkable result that FTE$^2$ only depends on the number of times the flux tube crosses the border between two spatial regions, and the dimension of the representation of the color group, but not on the string length. The result holds independently of whether the branching points are placed on the vertices of the lattice or in the center of plaquettes.",

Our numerical computations are conducted employing $N_f=2+1$ stout smeared clover fermions and a Symanzik gauge action on a lattice with spacing $a=0.077\\;\\rm{fm}$, and a pion mass of 303 MeV. To approach the large momentum regime, we simulate the equal-time correlations with the hadron momentum $P^z = \\{2.52, 3.02, 3.52\\}$ GeV. By investigating the potential analytic characteristics of the baryon quasi-distribution amplitude in coordinate space, we validate these findings through our lattice calculations. After renormalization and extrapolation, we present results for the three-dimensional distribution of momentum fractions for the two light quarks. Based on these findings the paper briefly discusses the phenomenological impact on weak decays of $Λ_b$, and outlines potential systematic uncertainties that can be improved in the future. This work lays the theoretical foundation for accessing baryon LCDAs from lattice QCD.",

      "title": "String-Breaking Dynamics in Quantum Adiabatic and Diabatic Processes",
      "summary": "Confinement prohibits isolation of color charges, e.g., quarks, in nature via a process called string breaking: the separation of two charges results in an increase in the energy of a color flux, visualized as a string, connecting those charges. Eventually, creating additional charges is energetically favored, hence breaking the string. Such a phenomenon can be probed in simpler models, including quantum spin chains, enabling enhanced understanding of string-breaking dynamics. A challenging task is to understand how string breaking occurs as time elapses, in an out-of-equilibrium setting. This work establishes the phenomenology of dynamical string breaking induced by a gradual increase of string tension over time. It, thus, goes beyond instantaneous quench processes and enables tracking the real-time evolution of strings in a more controlled setting. We focus on domain-wall confinement in a family of quantum Ising chains. Our results indicate that, for sufficiently short strings and slow evolution, string breaking can be described by the transition dynamics of a two-state quantum system akin to a Landau-Zener process. For longer strings, a more intricate spatiotemporal pattern emerges: the string breaks by forming a superposition of bubbles (domains of flipped spins of varying sizes), which involve highly excited states. We finally demonstrate that string breaking driven only by quantum fluctuations can be realized in the presence of sufficiently long-ranged interactions. This work holds immediate relevance for studying string breaking in quantum-simulation experiments.",

      "summary": "The non-singlet part of the chiral symmetry in QCD with two light flavors is known to be restored through a crossover transition at a pseudo-critical temperature. However, the temperature dependence of the singlet part of the chiral symmetry and whether it is effectively restored at the same temperature is not well understood. Using (2+1)-flavor QCD configurations generated using the Möbius domain-wall discretization on an $N_τ=8$ lattice, we construct suitable observables where the singlet and non-singlet chiral symmetries are disentangled in order to study their temperature dependence across the crossover transition. From the peak of the disconnected part of the chiral susceptibility, we obtain a pseudo-critical temperature $T_{pc}=158.7{}_{{}-2.3}^{{}+2.6}$ MeV where the non-singlet part of the chiral symmetry is effectively restored. From a calculation of the topological susceptibility and its temperature dependence we find that the singlet $U_A(1)$ part of the chiral symmetry is not effectively restored at $T<186$ MeV.",

      "summary": "We present complete results for the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_μ$ in the short- and intermediate-distance window regions, which account for roughly 10% and 35% of the total HVP contribution to $a_μ$, respectively. In particular, we perform lattice-QCD calculations for the isospin-symmetric connected and disconnected contributions, as well as corrections due to strong isospin-breaking. For the short-distance window observables, we investigate the so-called log-enhancement effects as well as the significant oscillations associated with staggered quarks in this region. For the dominant, isospin-symmetric light-quark connected contribution, we obtain $a^{ll,\\,{\\mathrm{SD}}}_μ(\\mathrm{conn.}) = 48.139(11)_{\\mathrm{stat}}(91)_{\\mathrm{syst}}[92]_{\\mathrm{total}} \\times 10^{-10}$ and $a^{ll,\\,{\\mathrm{W}}}_μ(\\mathrm{conn.}) = 206.90(14)_{\\mathrm{stat}}(61)_{\\mathrm{syst}}[63]_{\\mathrm{total}} \\times 10^{-10}$. We use Bayesian model averaging to fully estimate the covariance matrix between the individual contributions. Our determinations of the complete window contributions are $a^{\\mathrm{SD}}_μ = 69.05(1)_{\\mathrm{stat}}(21)_{\\mathrm{syst}}[21]_{\\mathrm{total}} \\times 10^{-10}$ and $a^{\\mathrm{W}}_μ = 236.45(17)_{\\mathrm{stat}}(83)_{\\mathrm{syst}}[85]_{\\mathrm{total}} \\times 10^{-10}$.

This integration simplifies the process of writing calculation codes, enabling researchers to build more complex Python packages like EasyDistillation for specific physics objectives. PyQUDA supports a range of lattice QCD operations, including hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) with N-flavor clover/HISQ fermions and inversion for the Wilson/clover/HISQ fermion action with the multigrid solver.

We show that in many cases these lower bounds can be improved by removing the bitstrings with a probability lower than some value $p_{min}$ and renormalizing the remaining probabilities (filtering). We propose a heuristic based on the change of the conditional entropy under filtering that very effectively improves the estimate of $S^{vN}_A$. We consider various sizes, lattice spacings and bipartitions. Our numerical investigation suggest that the filtered mutual information obtained with samples having just a few thousand bitstrings can provide reasonably close estimates of $S^{vN}_A$. We briefly discuss practical implementations with QuEra's Aquila device.",

      "summary": "A key issue affecting the attempt to reduce the uncertainty on the Standard Model prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment is the current discrepancy between lattice-QCD and data-driven results for the hadronic vacuum polarization. Progress on this issue benefits from precise data-driven determinations of the isospin-limit light-quark-connected (lqc) and strange-plus-light-quark-disconnected (s+lqd) components of the related RBC/UKQCD windows. In this paper, using a strategy employed previously for the intermediate window, we provide data-driven results for the lqc and s+lqd components of the short- and long-distance RBC/UKQCD windows. Comparing these results with those from the lattice, we find significant discrepancies in the lqc parts but good agreement for the s+lqd components. We also explore the impact of recent CMD-3 $e^+e^-\\to π^+π^-$ cross-section results, demonstrating that an upward shift in the $ρ$-peak region of the type seen in the CMD-3 data serves to eliminate the discrepancies for the lqc components without compromising the good agreement between lattice and data-driven s+lqd results.",

We review the determination of the $B_K$ parameter of neutral kaon mixing as well as the additional four $B$ parameters that arise in theories of physics beyond the Standard Model. For the heavy-quark sector, we provide results for $m_c$ and $m_b$ as well as those for the decay constants, form factors, and mixing parameters of charmed and bottom mesons and baryons. These are the heavy-quark quantities most relevant for the determination of CKM matrix elements and the global CKM unitarity-triangle fit. We review the status of lattice determinations of the strong coupling constant $α_s$. We review the determinations of nucleon charges from the matrix elements of both isovector and flavour-diagonal axial, scalar and tensor local quark bilinears, and momentum fraction, helicity moment and the transversity moment from one-link quark bilinears. We also review determinations of scale-setting quantities. Finally, in this review we have added a new section on the general definition of the low-energy limit of the Standard Model.",

      "summary": "Lattice quantum field theory calculations may potentially combine the advantages of Hamiltonian formulations with the scalability and control of conventional Lagrangian frameworks. However, such hybrid approaches need to consider (1) the differences in renormalized coupling values between the two formulations, and (2) finite-volume and discretization effects when the Hamiltonian component of the calculation is characterized by a smaller volume or coarser lattice spacing than the Lagrangian component. This work investigates the role of both factors in the application of Hamiltonian-optimized interpolating operator constructions for the conventional Lagrangian framework. The numerical investigation is realized for the pseudoscalar meson in the Schwinger model, using tensor-network and Monte-Carlo calculations. It is demonstrated that tensor-network-optimized constructions are robust to both (1) and (2). In particular, accurate optimized constructions for the pseudoscalar meson can be obtained from calculations with a smaller number of Hamiltonian lattice sites, even when the meson mass itself receives significant finite-volume corrections. To the extent that these results generalize to theories with more complicated spectra, the method holds promise for near-term applications in large-scale calculations of lattice quantum field theory.",

In these proceedings, the theoretical foundation of this calculation will be reviewed and preliminary numerical results will be presented for all diagrams with the exception of those that are quark-line disconnected SU(3)-flavor-suppressed.

      "summary": "We present a comparison of different quantum state preparation algorithms and their overall efficiency for the Schwinger model with a theta term. While adiabatic state preparation (ASP) is proved to be effective, in practice it leads to large CNOT gate counts to prepare the ground state. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) provides excellent results while keeping the CNOT counts small by design, at the cost of an expensive classical minimization process. We introduce a ``blocked'' modification of the Schwinger Hamiltonian to be used in the QAOA that further decreases the length of the algorithms as the size of the problem is increased. The rodeo algorithm (RA) provides a powerful tool to efficiently prepare any eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, as long as its overlap with the initial guess is large enough. We obtain the best results when combining the blocked QAOA ansatz and the RA, as this provides an excellent initial state with a relatively short algorithm without the need to perform any classical steps for large problem sizes.",

      "summary": "We calculate the decay rate for $η_b \\to γγ$ in lattice QCD for the first time, providing a precise prediction for the Belle II experiment. Our calculation includes $u$, $d$, $s$ and $c$ quarks in the sea, using gluon field configurations generated by the MILC collaboration, at three values of the lattice spacing from $0.06\\;\\mathrm{fm}$ to $0.03\\;\\mathrm{fm}$. All quarks are treated in the Highly Improved Staggered Quark formalism, which enables us to reach the $b$ quark mass for our valence quarks on these fine lattices. We calculate quark-line connected correlation functions only. By working at additional heavy quark masses between those of $c$ and $b$ we map out the behaviour of the ratio $f_{η_h}/(M_{η_h}^2F_{η_h}(0,0))$, where $f$ is the decay constant, $M$, the mass and $F(0,0)$, the form factor for decay to two on-shell photons for the pseudoscalar heavyonium meson, $η_h$. This ratio takes the approximate value 0.5 in leading-order non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) but we are able to give a much more accurate analysis than this. Focussing on the $b$ quark mass, we find a ratio of $0.467(11)$, giving $Γ(η_b \\to γγ) = 0.559(32)_{\\text{fit}}(1)_{\\text{syst}} \\: \\mathrm{keV}$. Combined with a value for the branching fraction from NRQCD, our result can be used to determine the total width of the $η_b$ with a $6\\%$ uncertainty.",

      "summary": "An accurate calculation of the leading-order hadronic vacuum polarisation (LOHVP) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ($a_μ$) is key to determining whether a discrepancy, suggesting new physics, exists between the Standard Model and experimental results. This calculation can be expressed as an integral over Euclidean time of a current-current correlator $G(t)$, where $G(t)$ can be calculated using lattice QCD or, with dispersion relations, from experimental data for $e^+e^-\\to\\mbox{hadrons}$. The BMW/DMZ collaboration recently presented a hybrid approach in which $G(t)$ is calculated using lattice QCD for most of the contributing $t$ range, but using experimental data for the largest $t$ (lowest energy) region. Here we study the advantages of varying the position $t=t_1$ separating lattice QCD from data-driven contributions. The total LOHVP contribution should be independent of $t_1$, providing both a test of the experimental input and the robustness of the hybrid approach. We use this criterion and a correlated fit to show that Fermilab/HPQCD/MILC lattice QCD results from 2019 strongly favour the CMD-3 cross-section data for $e^+e^-\\toπ^+π^-$ over a combination of earlier experimental results for this channel. Further, the resulting total LOHVP contribution obtained is consistent with the result obtained by BMW/DMZ, and supports the scenario in which there is no significant discrepancy between the experimental value for $a_μ$ and that expected in the Standard Model. We then discuss how improved lattice results in this hybrid approach could provide a more accurate total LOHVP across a wider range of $t_1$ values with an uncertainty that is smaller than that from either lattice QCD or data-driven approaches on their own.",

      "summary": "The quantum numbers of monopoles in $R^3$ in the presence of massless fermions have been analyzed using a uniform flux background in $S^2\\times R$ coupled to fermions. An analogous study in $T^2\\times R$ is performed by studying the discrete symmetries of the Dirac Hamiltonian in the presence of a static uniform field on $T^2$ with a total flux of $Q$ in the continuum. The degenerate ground states are classified based on their transformation properties under $\\fracπ{2}$ rotations of $T^2$ that leave the background field invariant. We find that the lattice analysis with overlap fermions exactly reproduces the transformation properties of the single particle zero modes in the continuum. Whereas the transformation properties of the single particle negative energy states can be studied in the continuum and the lattice, we are also able to study the transformation properties and the particle number (charge) of the many-body ground state on a finite lattice, and we show that the contributions from the fully filled single-particle states cannot be ignored.",

      "summary": "We develop an approach for calculating heavy quark effective theory (HQET) light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) by employing a sequential effective theory methodology. The theoretical foundation of the framework is established, elucidating how the quasi distribution amplitudes (quasi DAs) with three scales can be utilized to compute HQET LCDAs. We provide theoretical support for this approach by demonstrating the rationale behind devising a hierarchical ordering for the three involved scales, discussing the factorization at each step, clarifying the underlying reason for obtaining HQET LCDAs in the final phase, and addressing potential theoretical challenges. The lattice QCD simulation aspect is explored in detail, and the computations of quasi DAs are presented. We employ three fitting strategies to handle contributions from excited states and extract the bare matrix elements. For renormalization purposes, we apply hybrid renormalization schemes at short and long distance separations. To mitigate long-distance perturbations, we perform an extrapolation in $λ= z\\cdot P^z$ and assess the stability against various parameters. After two-step matching, our results for HQET LCDAs are found in agreement with existing model parametrizations. The potential phenomenological implications of the results are discussed, shedding light on how these findings could impact our understanding of the strong interaction dynamics and physics beyond the standard model. It should be noted, however, that systematic uncertainties have not been accounted for yet.",

Three approaches are tested: SNAP & Displacement gates, ECD & single-qubit rotations $R(θ,φ)$, and optimal pulse control. For all three decompositions, implementing the necessary sequence of rotations concurrently rather then sequentially can reduce the primitive gate run time. The number of blocks required for the faster ECD & $R_p(θ)$ is found to scale $\\mathcal{O}(d^2)$, while slower SNAP & Displacement set scales at worst $\\mathcal{O}(d)$. For qudits with $d<10$, the resulting gate times for the decompositions is similar, but strongly-dependent on experimental design choices. Optimal control can outperforms both decompositions for small $d$ by a factor of 2-12 at the cost of higher classical resources. Lastly, we find that SNAP & Displacement are slightly more robust to a simplified noise model.",

By approximating these lines as a power series in the baryon chemical potential $μ_B$, one can extrapolate them from first-principle results at zero net-baryon density, and use them to locate the QCD critical point, including the associated first-order and spinodal lines. As a proof of principle, we employ currently available continuum-extrapolated first-principle results from the Wuppertal--Budapest collaboration to find a critical point at a temperature and a baryon chemical potential of $T_c = 114.3 \\pm 6.9$ MeV and $μ_{B,c} = 602.1 \\pm 62.1$ MeV, respectively.

      "summary": "We present an implementation of the three-neutron quantization condition (QC) derived in previous work. We construct the matrices appearing in the QC and determine solutions numerically. The symmetries of the QC allow the projection onto irreducible representations of the appropriate little group (depending on frame momentum), restricting the size of the matrices and reducing computational complexity. In this initial study, we include only two-neutron interactions, which are modeled based on experimental data for $I=1$ scattering amplitudes. We show examples of the finite-volume spectrum in two frames and for a range of energies, illustrating the potential and also the challenges of using three-neutron spectroscopy to constrain the underlying interactions.",

      "title": "Observation of string-breaking dynamics in a quantum simulator",
      "summary": "Spontaneous particle-pair formation is a fundamental phenomenon in nature. It can, for example, appear when the potential energy between two particles increases with separation, as if they were connected by a tense string. Beyond a critical separation, new particle pairs can form, causing the string to break. String-breaking dynamics in quantum chromodynamics play a vital role in high-energy particle collisions and early universe evolution. Simulating string evolution and hadron formation is, therefore, a grand challenge in modern physics. Quantum simulators, well-suited for studying dynamics, are expected to outperform classical computing methods. However, the required experimental capabilities to simulate string-breaking dynamics have not yet been demonstrated, even for simpler models of the strong force. We experimentally probe, for the first time, the spatiotemporal dynamics of string-breaking in a (1+1)-dimensional $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory using a fully programmable trapped-ion quantum simulator. We emulate external static charges and strings via site-dependent magnetic-field control enabled by a dual array of tightly focused laser beams targeting individual ions. First, we study how confinement affects isolated charges, finding that they freely spread without string tension but exhibit localized oscillations when tension is increased. Then, we observe and characterize string-breaking dynamics of a string stretched between two static charges after an abrupt increase in string tension. Charge pairs appear near the string edges and spread into the bulk, revealing a route to dynamical string-breaking distinct from the conventional Schwinger mechanism. Our work demonstrates that analog quantum simulators have achieved the necessary control to explore string-breaking dynamics, which may ultimately be relevant to nuclear and high-energy physics.",

      "summary": "Parton distribution functions (PDFs) at large $x$ are challenging to extract from experimental data, yet they are essential for understanding hadron structure and searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Within the framework of the large momentum $P^z$ expansion of lattice quasi-PDFs, we investigate large $x$ PDFs, where the matching coefficient is factorized into the hard kernel, related to the active quark momentum $x P^z$, and the threshold soft function, associated with the spectator momentum $(1-x) P^z$. The renormalization group equation of the soft function enables the resummation of the threshold double logarithms $α^{k} \\ln^{2k}(1-x)$, which is crucial for a reliable and controllable calculation of large $x$ PDFs. Our analysis with pion valence PDFs indicates that perturbative matching breaks down when the spectator momentum $(1-x)P^z$ approaches $Λ_{\\rm QCD}$, but remains valid when both $x P^z$ and $(1-x)P^z$ are much larger than $Λ_{\\rm QCD}$. Additionally, we incorporate leading renormalon resummation within the threshold framework, demonstrating good perturbative convergence in the region where both spectator and active quark momenta are perturbative scales.",

It is found that the contributions of quark spin to the spin of 1S, 1P charmonia and also proton-like triple heavy quark state are comparable with the expectation of non-relativistic quark model. Such an observation provides evidence that the non-triviality of proton spin decomposition mainly arises from the relativistic effects of the light quark. Conversely, the substantial gluon angular momentum contribution in the spin $(1/2)^+$ state with triple heavy quarks at the charm quark mass, remains significant, highlighting the ongoing importance of the gluon in the realm of charmed baryon physics.",

      "summary": "The QCD cross-over line in the temperature ($T$) -- baryo-chemical potential ($μ_B$) plane has been computed by several lattice groups by calculating the chiral order parameter and its susceptibility at finite values of $μ_B$. In this work we focus on the deconfinement aspect of the transition between hadronic and Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) phases. We define the deconfinement temperature as the peak position of the static quark entropy ($S_Q(T,μ_B)$) in $T$, which is based on the renormalized Polyakov loop. We extrapolate $S_Q(T,μ_B)$ based on high statistics finite temperature ensembles on a $16^3\\times 8$ lattice to finite density by means of a Taylor expansion to eighth order in $μ_B$ (NNNLO) along the strangeness neutral line. For the simulations the 4HEX staggered action was used with 2+1 flavors at physical quark masses. In this setup the phase diagram can be drawn up to unprecedentedly high chemical potentials. Our results for the deconfinement temperature are in rough agreement with phenomenological estimates of the freeze-out curve in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In addition, we study the width of the deconfinement crossover. We show that up to $μ_B \\approx 400$ MeV, the deconfinement transition gets broader at higher densities, disfavoring the existence of a deconfinement critical endpoint in this range. Finally, we examine the transition line without the strangeness neutrality condition and observe a hint for the narrowing of the crossover towards large $μ_B$.",

For a broad subclass of physical many-body mixed Gaussian states, including the free scalar field vacuum, the logarithmic negativity is here shown to be a necessary and sufficient measure of entanglement and to be entirely accessible by pairs of single-mode detectors in the continuum. By deriving exact and optimal detection profiles, entanglement resources in the massive field are demonstrated to be available at all distances.",

Recently, gauge-variant quantities have also been found to be more amenable to signal-to-noise optimization using contour deformations.

This work introduces a differentiable parameterization of gauge fixing which is broad enough to cover Landau gauge, Coulomb gauge, and maximal tree gauges.

Our analysis employs the short-distance factorization framework on ratio-scheme renormalized quasi-GPD matrix elements. The calculations are based on an $N_f=2+1+1$ twisted mass fermions ensemble with clover improvement, a lattice spacing of $a = 0.093$ fm, and a pion mass of $m_π= 260$ MeV. We consider both the iso-vector and iso-scalar cases, utilizing next-to-leading-order perturbative matching while omitting the disconnected contributions and gluon mixing in the iso-scalar case. For the first time, we determine the Mellin moments of $\\widetilde{H}$ up to the fifth order. From these moments, we discuss the quark helicity and orbital angular momentum contributions to the nucleon spin, as well as the spin-orbit correlations of the quarks. Additionally, we perform a Fourier transform over the momentum transfer, which allows us to explore the spin structure in the impact-parameter space.",

This method leverages the gradient flow for fermion and gauge fields. The flowed matrix elements of twist-2 operators renormalize multiplicatively, and the matching with physical matrix elements is achieved through the use of continuum symmetries. We derive the matching coefficients at one-loop in perturbation theory for moments of any order in the flavor non-singlet case and provide specific examples of operators suitable for lattice QCD computations. The multiplicative renormalization and matching are independent of the choice of Lorentz indices, allowing the use of temporal indices for twist-2 operators of any dimension.

      "summary": "We construct a novel flux tube entanglement entropy (FTE$^2$), defined as the excess entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum of a region of color flux stretching between a heavy quark-anti-quark pair in pure gauge Yang-Mills theory. We show that FTE$^2$ can be expressed in terms of correlators of Polyakov loops, is manifestly gauge-invariant, and therefore free of the ambiguities in computations of the entanglement entropy in gauge theories related to the choice of the center algebra. Employing the replica trick, we compute FTE$^2$ for $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory in (2+1)D and demonstrate that it is finite in the continuum limit. We explore the properties of FTE$^2$ for a half-slab geometry, which allows us to vary the width and location of the slab, and the extent to which the slab cross-cuts the color flux tube. Following the intuition provided by computations of FTE$^2$ in (1+1)D, and in a thin string model, we examine the extent to which our FTE$^2$ results can be interpreted as the sum of an internal color entropy and a vibrational entropy corresponding to the transverse excitations of the string.",

Characterized by multiple Hamiltonian functions, this formalism allows me to include forces from non-local objects in the MD evolution while preserving the target probability distribution. In this way, the changes proposed by the MD at one location can be made using instantaneous knowledge of the long-distance behavior of the gauge field to a degree beyond that usually provided by the fermion determinant.

Our analysis includes gauge ensembles at the physical pion and kaon masses spread over six lattice spacings in the range [0.064-0.1315]~fm. Our main results read $m_η = 543.5(5.6)~$MeV and $m_{η^{\\prime}} = 986(38)~$MeV, consistent with the experimental values. This is an important numerical test that supports the validity of the fourth root procedure used in the staggered quark formalism. This calculation was the first step towards extracting the pseudoscalar transition form factors of the $η$ and $η^{\\prime}$ mesons that play a crucial role in the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon $g-2$.",

Within the framework of generalized parton distributions (GPDs), this approach allows for the extraction of detailed information about nucleon tomography and the total angular momentum carried by valence quarks. To accomplish this reliably, we introduce a new quantity, the \"double ratio\", which significantly reduces the systematic uncertainties inherent in lattice QCD computations. Moreover, we introduce a \"shadow\" term in the extraction procedure, which is sensitive only to lattice-QCD results. This term allows us to investigate the model dependence of the extraction, providing a more flexible description of the nucleon that goes beyond the previously considered bell-shaped distribution.",

      "summary": "Lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations share a defining challenge by requiring a small finite range of spatial separation $z$ between quark/gluon bilinears for controllable power corrections in the perturbative QCD factorization, and a large hadron boost $p_z$ for a successful determination of collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs). However, these two requirements make the determination of PDFs from lattice data very challenging. We present the application of generative machine learning algorithms to estimate the polarized and unpolarized gluon correlation functions utilizing short-distance data and extending the correlation up to $zp_z \\lesssim 14$, surpassing the current capabilities of lattice QCD calculations. We train physics-informed machine learning algorithms to learn from the short-distance correlation at $z\\lesssim 0.36$ fm and take the limit, $p_z \\to \\infty$, thereby minimizing possible contamination from the higher-twist effects for a successful reconstruction of the polarized gluon PDF. We also expose the bias and problems with underestimating uncertainties associated with the use of model-dependent and overly constrained functional forms, such as $x^α(1-x)^β$ and its variants to extract PDFs from the lattice data. We propose the use of generative machine learning algorithms to mitigate these issues and present our determination of the polarized and unpolarized gluon PDFs in the nucleon.",

This approach incorporates the effect of the one-pion exchange diagram in $DDπ$ and $DD^*$ scattering, making it applicable at energies coinciding with the left-hand cut in the partial-wave projected $DD^*$ amplitude. We present an example application of this framework to existing lattice QCD data at $m_π= 280$ MeV. We solve the integral equations describing the $DDπ$ reaction, use LSZ reduction to determine the corresponding $DD^*$ amplitude, and find the values of the infinite-volume two- and three-body $K$ matrices that lead to agreement with lattice $DD^*$ phase shifts within their uncertainties. Using these $K$ matrices in the three-particle quantization condition, we describe the finite-volume $DD^*$ spectrum and find good agreement with the lattice QCD energies. Our results suggest that, at this pion mass, the tetraquark appears as a pair of subthreshold complex poles whose precise location strongly depends on the value of the $DDπ$ three-particle $K$ matrix.",

The McNeile and Michael method is adopted to extract the effective couplings for individual decay modes, which are used to estimate the partial decay widths of $π_1(1600)$ and $η_1(1855)$ by assuming SU(3) symmetry. The partial decay widths of $π_1(1600)$ are predicted to be $(Γ_{b_1π}, Γ_{f_1(1285)π}, Γ_{ρπ}, Γ_{K^*\\bar{K}}) = (325 \\pm 75, \\mathcal{O}(10), 52 \\pm 7, 8.6 \\pm 1.3)~\\mathrm{MeV}$, and the total width is estimated to be $396 \\pm 90~\\mathrm{MeV}$, considering only statistical errors. If $η_1(1855)$ and the $4.4σ$ signal observed by BESIII (labeled as $η_1(2200)$) are taken as the two mass eigenstates of the isoscalar $1^{-+}$ light hybrids in SU(3), then the dominant decay channel(s) of $η_1(1855)$ ($η_1(2200)$) is $K_1(1270)\\bar{K}$ ($K_1(1270)\\bar{K}$ and $K_1(1400)\\bar{K}$) through the $1^{+(-)}0^{-(+)}$ mode. The vector-vector decay modes are also significant for the two $η_1$ states. Using the mixing angle $α\\approx 22.7^\\circ$ obtained from lattice QCD for the two $η_1$ states, the total widths are estimated to be $Γ_{η_1(1855)}=282(85)~\\mathrm{MeV}$ and $Γ_{η_1(2200)}=455(143)~\\mathrm{MeV}$. The former is compatible with the experimental width of $η_1(1855)$. Although many systematic uncertainties are not well controlled, these results are qualitatively informative for the experimental search for light hybrids.",

      "summary": "Motivated by recent developments in the application of light-ray operators (LROs) in high energy physics, we propose a new strategy to study correlation functions of LROs through real-time quantum simulations. We argue that quantum simulators provide an ideal laboratory to explore the properties LROs in lower-dimensional quantum field theories (QFTs). This is exemplified in the 1+1-d Schwinger model, employing tensor network methods, focusing on the calculation of energy and charge correlators. Despite some challenges in extracting the necessary correlation functions from the lattice the methodology used can be extended to real quantum devices.",

      "summary": "We develop a gauge invariant, Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) based representation of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory defined on a general graph consisting of vertices and half-links. Inspired by weak coupling studies, we apply this technique to maximal tree gauge fixing. This allows us to develop a fully gauge fixed representation of the theory in terms of LSH quantum numbers. We explicitly show how the quantum numbers in this formulation directly relate to the variables in the magnetic description. In doing so, we will also explain in detail the way that the Kogut-Susskind formulation, prepotentials, and point splitting, work for general graphs. In the appendix of this work we provide a self-contained exposition of the mathematical details of Hamiltonian pure gauge theories defined on general graphs.",

      "summary": "We present a general method to determine the probability that stochastic Monte Carlo data, in particular those generated in a lattice QCD calculation, would have been obtained were that data drawn from the distribution predicted by a given theoretical hypothesis. Such a probability, or p-value, is often used as an important heuristic measure of the validity of that hypothesis. The proposed method offers the benefit that it remains usable in cases where the standard Hotelling $T^2$ methods based on the conventional $χ^2$ statistic do not apply, such as for uncorrelated fits. Specifically, we analyze a general alternative to the correlated $χ^2$ statistic referred to as $q^2$, and show how to use the bootstrap as a data-driven method to determine the expected distribution of $q^2$ for a given hypothesis with minimal assumptions. This distribution can then be used to determine the p-value for a fit to the data. We also describe a bootstrap approach for quantifying the impact upon this p-value of estimating population parameters from a single ensemble of $N$ samples. The overall method is accurate up to a $1/N$ bias which we do not attempt to quantify.",

The simultaneous solution for a modest number of right hand sides concurrently allows for a significant reduction in the time spent solving the coarse grid operator in a multigrid preconditioner. We introduce a preconditioned block conjuate gradient with a multigrid preconditioner, giving additional algorithmic benefit from the multiple right hand sides. There is also a very significant additional to computation rate benefit to multiple right hand sides. This both increases the arithmetic intensity in the coarse space and increases the amount of work being performed in each subroutine call, leading to excellent performance on modern GPU architectures. Further, the software implementation makes use of vendor linear algebra routines (batched GEMM) that can make use of high throughput tensor hardware on recent Nvidia, AMD and Intel GPUs. The cost of the coarse space is made sub-dominant in this algorithm, and benchmarks from the Frontier supercomputer system show up to a factor of twenty speed up over the standard red-black preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm on a large system with physical quark masses.",

In this study, we consider two different gluon operators, for which the hybrid-ratio renormalization matching kernels have been recently derived, and a third operator that has been used in prior pseudo-PDF studies of the gluon PDFs. We compare matrix elements for each operators for both nucleon and pseudo-scalar mesons, both pion masses, and two gauge-smearing techniques. Focusing on the more phenomenologically studied nucleon gluon PDF, we compare the ratio and hybrid-ratio renormalized matrix elements at both pion masses and both smearings to those reconstructed from the nucleon gluon PDF from the CT18 global analysis. We identify the best choice of operator to study the gluon PDF through LaMET and present the first gluon quasi-PDF under some caveats. Additionally, we explore the recent idea of Coulomb gauge fixing to improve signal at large Wilson line displacement and found it could be a major help in improving the signal of gluon matrix elements given the perturbative calculation to confirm our results. This work helps identify the best operator for studying the gluon quasi-PDF, shows higher hadron boost momentum is needed to implement hybrid-ratio renormalization reliably, and suggests the need to study more diverse set of operators with their corresponding perturbative calculations for hybrid-ratio renormalization to further gluon quasi-PDF study.",

We utilize an nHYP-smeared fermion action supplemented with additional heavy Pauli-Villars fields which serve to decrease lattice artifacts. The phase diagram exhibits a clear two-phase structure with a conformal phase at weak coupling and a novel new phase, the Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG) phase, appearing at strong coupling. The SMG phase is confining with all states gapped and chiral symmetry unbroken. Our finite size scaling analysis provides strong evidence that the phase transition between these two phases is continuous, which would allow for the existence of a continuum SMG phase. Furthermore, the RG flows are consistent with a $β$-function that vanishes quadratically at the new fixed point suggesting that the $N_f=4$ flavor SU(2) gauge theory lies at the opening of the conformal window.",

We employ the MILC collaboration's gauge-field ensemble with $2+1+1$ flavors of highly improved staggered sea quarks at a lattice spacing of $a\\approx 0.15$ fm with a light sea-quark mass at its physical value. The two-pion contributions allow for a refined determination of the noisy long-distance tail of the vector-current correlation function, which we use to compute the light-quark connected contribution to HVP with improved statistical precision. We compare our results with traditional noise-reduction techniques used in lattice QCD calculations of the light-quark connected HVP, namely the so-called fit and bounding methods. We observe a factor of roughly three improvement in the statistical precision in the determination of the HVP contribution to the muon's anomalous magnetic moment over these approaches. We also lay the group theoretical groundwork for extending this calculation to finer lattice spacings with increased numbers of staggered two-pion taste states.",

The results are based on the same quenched Wilson ensembles on a $24^3\\times 48$ lattice at $β=6.0$ with pion mass from 1100 to 370 MeV previously used for a charged pion. For electric polarizability, the results are largely consistent with those from the background field method and ChPT. In contrast, there are significant differences for magnetic polarizability among the four-point function method, the background field method, and ChPT.

      "summary": "Inspired by recent advancements of simulating periodic systems on quantum computers, we develop a new approach, (SC)$^2$-ADAPT-VQE, to further advance the simulation of these systems. Our approach extends the scalable circuits ADAPT-VQE framework, which builds an ansatz from a pool of coordinate-invariant operators defined for arbitrarily large, though not arbitrarily small, volumes. Our method uses a classically tractable ``Surrogate Constructed'' method to remove irrelevant operators from the pool, reducing the minimum size for which the scalable circuits are defined. Bringing together the scalable circuits and the surrogate constructed approaches forms the core of the (SC)$^2$ methodology. Our approach allows for a wider set of classical computations, on small volumes, which can be used for a more robust extrapolation protocol. While developed in the context of lattice models, the surrogate construction portion is applicable to a wide variety of problems where information about the relative importance of operators in the pool is available. As an example, we use it to compute properties of the Schwinger model - quantum electrodynamics for a single, massive fermion in $1+1$ dimensions - and show that our method can be used to accurately extrapolate to the continuum limit.",

      "title": "Coulomb confinement in the Hamiltonian limit",
      "summary": "The Gribov--Zwanziger scenario attributes the phenomenon of confinement to the instantaneous interaction term in the QCD Hamiltonian in the Coulomb gauge. For a static quark-antiquark pair, it leads to a potential energy that increases linearly with the distance between them. Lattice studies of the SU(2) Yang--Mills theory determined the corresponding (Coulomb) string tension for sources in the fundamental representation, $σ_{C}$, to be about three times larger than the Wilson loop string tension, $σ_F$. It is far above the Zwanziger variational bound, $σ_C \\geq σ_F$. We argue that the value established in the literature is artificially inflated. We examine the lattice definition of the instantaneous potential, find the source of the string tension's enhancement, and perform its improved determination in SU(2) lattice gauge theory. We report our conservative estimate for the value of the Coulomb string tension as $σ_C/σ_F = 2.0 \\pm 0.4$ and discuss its phenomenological implications.",

      "summary": "We study the behavior of the vacuum in Euclidean dynamical triangulations (EDT). Algorithmic improvements and better lattice spacing determinations allow us to test the properties of the emergent de Sitter geometries of our simulations to higher precision than previously possible. Although the agreement with de Sitter is good, the improved precision reveals deviations that can be interpreted as non-trivial vacuum dynamics, well-described by a cosmological constant that runs with scale. The simulations show that the dominant running is quadratic and that the scale can be identified with the Hubble rate. Several key cross-checks support this picture, including consistent results across multiple lattice spacings and the fact that the null energy condition is not violated. The parameters of the running are fully determined by simulations, enabling predictions when extrapolated to the scales relevant for our universe. This leads to a model for dark energy that is compatible with current observations, but which predicts deviations from $Λ$CDM at the ${\\cal O}(10^{-3})$ level in cosmological observables that could be tested with future improvements in precision measurements.",

      "summary": "Recently, it has been proposed to compute parton distributions from boosted correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge within the framework of Large-Momentum Effective Theory. This method does not involve Wilson lines and could greatly improve the efficiency and precision of lattice QCD calculations. However, there are concerns about whether the systematic uncertainties from Gribov copies, which correspond to the ambiguity in lattice gauge-fixing, are under control. This work gives an assessment of the Gribov copies' effect in the Coulomb-gauge-fixed quark correlators. We utilize different strategies for the Coulomb-gauge fixing, selecting two different groups of Gribov copies based on the lattice gauge configurations. We test the difference in the resulted spatial quark correlators in the vacuum and a pion state. Our findings indicate that the statistical errors of the matrix elements from both Gribov copies, regardless of the correlation range, decrease proportionally to the square root of the number of gauge configurations. The difference between the strategies does not show statistical significance compared to the gauge noise. This demonstrates that the effect of the Gribov copies can be neglected in the practical lattice calculation of the quark parton distributions.",

We provide a heuristic explanation for the connection between the formal summation/expansion and the Mellin-Barnes integral in the literature, and specify the exact convergence condition. We derive an asymptotic condition on the conformal moments of GPDs to satisfy the boundary condition at $x=1$ and subsequently develop an approximate formula for GPDs when $x>ξ$. Since experimental observables constraining GPDs can be expressed in terms of double or even triple summations involving their moments, scale evolution factors, and Wilson coefficients, etc., we propose a method to handle the ordering of the multiple summations and convert them into multiple Mellin-Barnes integrals via analytical continuations of integer summation indices.",

D 111, 5 (2025)), it was observed that the next-to-leading order calculations of the renormalization factor can describe, to a few percent accuracy, the logarithm of the lattice QCD rest frame matrix elements with separations up to distances of 0.6 fm on multiple lattice spacings. We argue that perturbative QCD breaks down at such a distance scale after resumming the associated large logarithms, while the ansatz used in the analysis there is not justified in perturbation theory. Besides, we explain the observation in Phys. Rev. D 111, 5 (2025) and demonstrate that the ansatz fails to describe the data for $z>0.3$ fm, showing an opposite trend. Finally, although Phys. Rev. D 111, 5 (2025) proposes multiplying the ansatz by a Gaussian correction model, which is shown to reduce the discrepancy with the data, this does not legitimize the use of perturbative QCD at such distance scales.",

These ensembles are generated through the stout smeared clover fermion action and Symanzik gauge actions with the tadpole improvement. By absorbing the discretization errors into the masses and field normalization of the charm quark, we manage to suppress the discretization error of the charmed meson mass and all the S-wave open charmed meson decay constants to a few percent or even less at lattice spacing \\( a \\sim 0.1 \\) fm. Moreover, discretization errors for other quantities are also significantly reduced. The continuum extrapolated charm quark mass, $m_c(m_c)=1.2933(72)(95)$ GeV in $\\overline{\\textrm{MS}}$ scheme, is determined using QED-subtracted $D_s$ meson mass and non-perturbative renormalization. Predictions of the open and close charm mesons using this charm quark mass agree with the experimental values at 0.1-0.5\\% level uncertainty. We obtained $D_{(s)}$ decay constants and also by far the most precise $D_{(s)}^*$ decay constants $f_{D^*}=0.2292(26)(17)$ GeV and $f_{D^*_s}=0.2691(30)(03)$ GeV.",

As such, standard lattice QCD studies have been limited to indirect parton observables such as first few moments and short-distance correlations, which do not provide the $x$-distributions without solving the model-dependent inverse problem. Here I describe an alternative formulation of partons in terms of equal-time (or Euclidean) correlators, which allows to compute precision-controlled $x$-distribution through lattice QCD simulations. This approach is in accord with Weinberg's pioneering idea of effective field theory as well as Wilson's renormalization group, in which the large hadron momentum serves as a natural cut-off for light-cone/rapidity divergences and can ultimately be eliminated through a method like the ``perfect action'' program in lattice QCD.",

By performing experiments on a digital quantum computer consisting of fully-connected optically-controlled trapped ions, we study the role of entanglement in the thermalization dynamics of a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in 2+1 spacetime dimensions. Using randomized-measurement protocols, we efficiently learn a classical approximation of non-equilibrium states that yields the gap-ratio distribution and the spectral form factor of the entanglement Hamiltonian. These observables exhibit universal early-time signals for quantum chaos, a prerequisite for thermalization. Our work, therefore, establishes quantum computers as robust tools for studying universal features of thermalization in complex many-body systems, including in gauge theories.",

      "summary": "Recent work found that an analysis formalism based on the Lanczos algorithm allows energy levels to be extracted from Euclidean correlation functions with faster ground-state convergence than effective masses, convergent estimators for multiple states from a single correlator, and two-sided error bounds. After filtering out spurious eigenvalues and using outlier-robust estimators within a nested bootstrap framework, Lanczos estimators behave more like multi-state fit results than effective masses -- but without involving statistical fitting. We extend this formalism to the determination of matrix elements from three-point correlation functions and provide a physical picture of \"spurious state filtering\" involving restriction to a Hermitian subspace. We demonstrate similar advantages for matrix elements as for spectroscopy through example applications to noiseless mock-data and (bare) forward matrix elements of the strange scalar current between both ground and excited states with the quantum numbers of the nucleon.",

      "summary": "We present a calculation of the vector-isovector timelike form-factors of the pion and the kaon using lattice quantum chromodynamics. We calculate two-point correlation functions with $m_π\\sim 280$ MeV, extracting both the finite-volume spectrum and matrix elements for these states created from the vacuum by a vector current. After determining the coupled-channel $ππ, K\\overline{K}$ scattering amplitudes, we perform the necessary correction for the significant finite-volume effects present in the current matrix elements, leading to the timelike form-factors. We find these to be dominated by the presence of the $ρ$ resonance, and we extract its decay constant by an analytic continuation of the amplitudes to the resonance pole. In addition, the spacelike pion form-factor is determined on the same lattice configurations, and a dispersive parameterization is used to simultaneously describe the spacelike and elastic timelike regions.",

We adopt the approach of implementing the electroweak part as the infinite-volume version, which is denoted as the EW$_\\infty$ method in this work. A general approach is established for correcting finite-volume effects in cases where the hadronic intermediate states are dominated by either a single particle or two particles. For the single-particle case, this work derives the infinite volume reconstruction (IVR) method from a new perspective. For the two-particle case, we provide the correction formulas for power-law finite-volume effects and unphysical terms with exponentially divergent time dependence. The finite-volume formalism developed in this study has broad applications, including the QED corrections in various processes and the two-photon exchange contribution in $K_L\\toμ^+μ^-$ or $η\\toμ^+μ^-$ decays.",

The most significant contribution comes from the $z_3$ dependence induced by ultraviolet (UV) renormalization of the Wilson line. We demonstrate that the next-to-leading order perturbative calculations of the renormalization factor can describe, to a few percent accuracy, the logarithm of the lattice QCD rest frame matrix elements with separations up to distances of 0.6~fm on multiple lattice spacings. The residual discrepancies can be modeled by a leading effect from the structure of the nucleon.",

      "summary": "We introduce the Sequency Hierarchy Truncation (SeqHT) scheme for reducing the resources required for state preparation and time evolution in quantum simulations, based upon a truncation in sequency. For the $λφ^4$ interaction in scalar field theory, or any interaction with a polynomial expansion, upper bounds on the contributions of operators of a given sequency are derived. For the systems we have examined, observables computed in sequency-truncated wavefunctions, including quantum correlations as measured by magic, are found to step-wise converge to their exact values with increasing cutoff sequency. The utility of SeqHT is demonstrated in the adiabatic state preparation of the $λφ^4$ anharmonic oscillator ground state using IBM's quantum computer ${\\textit ibm\\_sherbrooke}$. Using SeqHT, the depth of the required quantum circuits is reduced by $\\sim 30\\%$, leading to significantly improved determinations of observables in the quantum simulations. More generally, SeqHT is expected to lead to a reduction in required resources for quantum simulations of systems with a hierarchy of length scales.",

This unitary lattice calculation is conducted using the domain wall fermion discretization scheme, a fine lattice spacing of approximately 0.08 fm, and physical values for light and strange quark masses. The CS kernel is determined analyzing the ratios of pion quasi-TMD wave functions (quasi-TMDWFs) at next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) perturbative accuracy. Thanks to the absence of Wilson-lines, the Coulomb-gauge-fixed quasi-TMDWF demonstrates a remarkably slower decay of signals with increasing quark separations. This allows us to access the non-perturbative CS kernel up to transverse separations of 1 fm. For small transverse separations, our results agree well with perturbative predictions. At larger transverse separations, our non-perturbative CS kernel clearly favors certain global fits.",

We point out that violations of the isospin symmetric limit of vanishing electric charge chemical potential are small along the $T_{pc}(μ_B)$ for the entire range of $μ_B$ covered in the RHIC beam energy scan. For the strangeness neutral matter produced in heavy-ion collisions this leads to a close relation between $χ_{11}^{BS}$ and $χ_{11}^{QS}$. We compare lattice QCD results for $χ_{11}^{BS}/χ_2^S$ along the $T_{pc}(μ_B)$ line with preliminary experimental measurements of $χ_{11}^{BS}/χ_2^S$ for collision energies $7.7~{\\rm GeV}\\le \\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}\\le 62.4~{\\rm GeV}$. While we find good agreements for $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}\\ge 39$~GeV, differences are sizeable at smaller values of $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$. Moreover, we compare lattice QCD results for the ratio of the strangeness ($μ_S$) to baryon ($μ_B$) chemical potentials, which define a strangeness neutral system with fixed electric charge to baryon number density, with experimental results obtained by the STAR collaboration for $μ_S/μ_B$ using strange baryon yields on the freeze-out line. Finally, we determine the baryon chemical potential at the freeze-out ($μ_B^f$) by comparing $χ_1^B/χ_2^B$ along the $T_{pc}(μ_B)$ with the experimentally measured net-proton cumulants $χ_1^p/χ_2^p$.

The calculation is performed on domain wall fermion configurations generated by the RBC-UKQCD Collaborations and the overlap fermion action is used for the valence quarks. Comparing the current results with our previous ones at a coarser lattice spacing $a\\sim0.11$ fm gives us a better understanding of the discretization error. We obtain $f_{D_s^*}^T(\\overline{\\rm MS},\\text{2 GeV})/f_{D_s^*}=0.907(20)$ with a better precision than our previous result. Combining our $f_{D_s^*}=277(11)$ MeV with the total width of $D_s^*$ determined in a recent work gives a branching fraction $4.26(52)\\times10^{-5}$ for $D_s^*$ leptonic decay.",

      "summary": "In this work, we report a lattice calculation of $x$-dependent valence pion generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at zero skewness with multiple values of the momentum transfer $-t$. The calculations are based on an $N_f=2+1$ gauge ensemble of highly improved staggered quarks with Wilson-Clover valence fermion. The lattice spacing is 0.04 fm, and the pion valence mass is tuned to be 300 MeV. We determine the Lorentz-invariant amplitudes of the quasi-GPD matrix elements for both symmetric and asymmetric momenta transfers with similar values and show the equivalence of both frames. Then, focusing on the asymmetric frame, we utilize a hybrid scheme to renormalize the quasi-GPD matrix elements obtained from the lattice calculations. After the Fourier transforms, the quasi-GPDs are then matched to the light-cone GPDs within the framework of large momentum effective theory with improved matching, including the next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative corrections, and leading renormalon and renormalization group resummations. We also present the 3-dimensional image of the pion in impact-parameter space through the Fourier transform of the momentum transfer $-t$.",

      "summary": "Simulating fermions coupled to spin degrees of freedom, relevant for a range of quantum field theories, represents a promising application for quantum simulators. Mapping fermions to qubits is challenging in $2+1$ and higher spacetime dimensions, and mapping bosons demands substantial quantum-computational overhead. These features complicate the realization of mixed fermion-boson quantum systems in digital quantum computers. We propose a native fermion-(large-)spin analog quantum simulator by utilizing dopant arrays in silicon. Specifically, we show how to use a dynamical lattice of coupled nuclear spins and conduction-band electrons to realize a quantum field theory: an extended Jackiw-Rebbi model involving coupled fermions and quantum rotors. We demonstrate the feasibility of observing dynamical mass generation and a confinement-deconfinement quantum phase transition in 1+1 dimensions on this platform, even in the presence of strong long-range Coulomb interactions. Furthermore, we employ finite-temperature Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov simulations to investigate the dynamics of mass generation in two-dimensional square and honeycomb arrays, showing that this phenomenon can be simulated with realistic experimental parameters. Our findings reveal two distinct phases, and demonstrate robustness against the addition of Coulomb interactions. Finally, we discuss experimental signatures of the phases through transport and local charge sensing in dopant arrays. This study lays the foundation for quantum simulations of quantum field theories exhibiting fermions coupled to spin degrees of freedom using donors in silicon.",

      "summary": "We present a lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the $x$-dependent pion and kaon distribution amplitudes (DA) in the framework of large momentum effective theory. This calculation is performed on a fine lattice of $a=0.076$ fm at physical pion mass, with the pion boosted to $1.8$ GeV and kaon boosted to $2.3$ GeV. We renormalize the matrix elements in the hybrid scheme and match to $\\overline{\\rm MS }$ with a subtraction of the leading renormalon in the Wilson-line mass. The perturbative matching is improved by resumming the large logarithms related to the small quark and gluon momenta in the soft-gluon limit. After resummation, we demonstrate that we are able to calculate a range of $x\\in[x_0,1-x_0]$ with $x_0=0.25$ for pion and $x_0=0.2$ for kaon with theoretical systematic errors under control. The kaon DA is shown to be slighted skewed, and narrower than pion DA. Although the $x$-dependence cannot be direct calculated beyond these ranges, we estimate higher moments of the pion and kaon DAs by complementing our calculation with short-distance factorization.",

Proof-of-principle analyses of the simple harmonic oscillator and the LQCD proton mass demonstrate that this method provides faster ground-state convergence than the \"effective mass,\" which is related to the power-iteration algorithm. Lanczos provides more accurate energy estimates than multi-state fits to correlation functions with small imaginary times while achieving comparable statistical precision. Two-sided error bounds are computed for Lanczos results and guarantee that excited-state effects cannot shift Lanczos results far outside their statistical uncertainties.",

Using lattice quantum chromodynamics, we postdict the defining parameters for two short-lived resonances, the $ρ(770)$ and $K^*(892)$, which manifest as complex energy poles in $ππ$ and $K π$ scattering amplitudes, respectively. The calculation proceeds by first computing the finite-volume energy spectrum of the two-hadron systems, and then determining the amplitudes from the energies using the Lüscher formalism. The error budget includes a data-driven systematic error, obtained by scanning possible fit ranges and fit models to extract the spectrum from Euclidean correlators, as well as the scattering amplitudes from the latter. The final results, obtained by analytically continuing multiple parameterizations into the complex energy plane, are $M_ρ= 796(5)(50)~\\mathrm{MeV}$, $Γ_ρ= 192(10)(31)~\\mathrm{MeV}$, $M_{K^*} = 893(2)(54)~\\mathrm{MeV}$ and $Γ_{K^*} = 51(2)(11)~\\mathrm{MeV}$, where the subscript indicates the resonance and $M$ and $Γ$ stand for the mass and width, respectively, and where the first bracket indicates the statistical and the second bracket the systematic uncertainty.",

By sampling a large number of representative sets of underlying energy-level fits, we also assign a systematic uncertainty to our final results. This is a significant extension to data-driven analysis methods that have been used in lattice QCD to date, due to the two-step nature of the formalism. Our final pole positions, $M+iΓ/2$, with all statistical and systematic errors exposed, are $M_{K^{*}} = 893(2)(8)(54)(2)~\\mathrm{MeV}$ and $Γ_{K^{*}} = 51(2)(11)(3)(0)~\\mathrm{MeV}$ for the $K^*(892)$ resonance and $M_ρ = 796(5)(15)(48)(2)~\\mathrm{MeV}$ and $Γ_ρ = 192(10)(28)(12)(0)~\\mathrm{MeV}$ for the $ρ(770)$ resonance.

      "summary": "Understanding the behavior of dense hadronic matter is a central goal in nuclear physics as it governs the nature and dynamics of astrophysical objects such as supernovae and neutron stars. Because of the non-perturbative nature of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), little is known rigorously about hadronic matter in these extreme conditions. Here, lattice QCD calculations are used to compute thermodynamic quantities and the equation of state of QCD over a wide range of isospin chemical potentials with controlled systematic uncertainties. Agreement is seen with chiral perturbation theory when the chemical potential is small. Comparison to perturbative QCD at large chemical potential allows for an estimate of the gap in the superconducting phase, and this quantity is seen to agree with perturbative determinations. Since the partition function for an isospin chemical potential, $μ_I$, bounds the partition function for a baryon chemical potential $μ_B=3μ_I/2$, these calculations also provide rigorous non-perturbative QCD bounds on the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state over a wide range of baryon densities for the first time.",

      "summary": "We study the renormalization of four-quark operators in one-loop perturbation theory. We employ a coordinate-space Gauge-Invariant Renormalization Scheme (GIRS), which can be advantageous compared to other schemes, especially in nonperturbative lattice investigations. From our perturbative calculations, we extract the conversion factors between GIRS and the modified Minimal Subtraction scheme ($\\overline{\\rm MS}$) at the next-to-leading order. A formidable issue in the study of the four-quark operators is that operators with different Dirac matrices mix among themselves upon renormalization. We focus on both parity-conserving and parity-violating four-quark operators, which change flavor numbers by two units ($ΔF = 2$). The extraction of the conversion factors entails the calculation of two-point Green's functions involving products of two four-quark operators, as well as three-point Green's functions with one four-quark and two bilinear operators. The significance of our results lies in their potential to refine our understanding of QCD phenomena, offering insights into the precision of Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements and shedding light on the nonperturbative treatment of complex mixing patterns associated with four-quark operators.",

The real part of this two-photon amplitude is of approximately the same size as that coming from a second-order weak strangeness-changing neutral-current process. Thus a test of the standard model prediction for this second-order weak process depends on an accurate result of this two-photon amplitude. A limiting factor of our proposed method comes from low-energy three-particle $ππγ$ states. The contribution from these states will be significantly distorted by the finite volume of our calculation -- a distortion for which there is no available correction. However, a simple estimate of the contribution of these three-particle states suggests their contribution to be at most a few percent allowing their neglect in a lattice calculation with a 10% target accuracy.",

      "summary": "The need to determine scattering amplitudes of few-hadron systems for arbitrary kinematics expands a broad set of subfields of modern-day nuclear and hadronic physics. In this work, we expand upon previous explorations on the use of real-time methods, like quantum computing or tensor networks, to determine few-body scattering amplitudes. Such calculations must be performed in a finite Minkowski spacetime, where scattering amplitudes are not well defined. Our previous work presented a conjecture of a systematically improvable estimator for scattering amplitudes constructed from finite-volume correlation functions. Here we provide further evidence that the prescription works for larger kinematic regions than previously explored as well as a broader class of scattering amplitudes. Finally, we devise a new method for estimating the order of magnitude of the error associated with finite time separations needed for such calculations. In units of the lightest mass of the theory, we find that to constrain amplitudes using real-time methods within $\\mathcal{O}(10\\%)$, the spacetime volumes must satisfy $mL \\sim \\mathcal{O}(10-10^2)$ and $ mT\\sim \\mathcal{O}(10^2-10^4)$.",

However, direct first-principle lattice gauge theory-based calculations of these observables in the timelike region remain challenging. Discrepancies persist between lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations in the spacelike region and dispersive approaches relying on experimental data parametrization from the timelike region. Here, we introduce a methodology employing 1+1-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED), i.e. the Schwinger Model, to investigate the HVP and HLBL. To that end, we use both tensor network techniques, specifically matrix product states, and classical emulators of digital quantum computers. Demonstrating feasibility in a simplified model, our approach sets the stage for future endeavors leveraging digital quantum computers.",

The connection between this approach to quark orbital angular momentum and approaches previously utilized in Lattice QCD calculations, via generalized transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions and via Ji's sum rule, is reviewed. This connection can be given in terms of Lorentz invariance and equation of motion relations. The calculation of the second Mellin moment of $\\widetilde{E}_{2T} $ proceeds via a finite-momentum proton matrix element of a quark bilocal operator with a straight-line gauge connection and separation in both the longitudinal and transverse directions. The dependence on the former component serves to extract the second Mellin moment, whereas the dependence on the latter component provides a transverse momentum cutoff for the matrix element. Furthermore, a derivative of the matrix element with respect to momentum transfer in the forward limit is required, which is obtained using a direct derivative method. The calculation utilizes a clover fermion ensemble at pion mass 317 MeV. The resulting quark orbital angular momentum is consistent with previous evaluations through alternative approaches, albeit with greater statistical uncertainty using a comparable number of samples.",

For the first time, we include threshold resummation in the perturbative matching onto the light-cone DA, which resums the large logarithms in the soft gluon limit at next-to-next-to-leading log. The resummed results show controlled scale-variation uncertainty within the range of momentum fraction $x\\in[0.25,0.75]$ at the largest pion momentum $P_z\\approx 1.85$~GeV. In addition, we apply the same analysis to quasi-DAs from a highly-improved-staggered-quark ensemble at physical pion mass and $a=0.076$ fm.

We use ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration at lattice spacings $a=\\{0.1207,0.0888,0.0582\\}$ fm, with $N_f=2+1+1$ flavors of highly improved staggered quarks at sea pion mass of $M_π\\approx 315$ MeV. We use clover-improved action for our valence quarks with nucleon boost momentum $P_z\\approx 1.75$ GeV and high-statistics measurements for the LaMET matrix elements. We perform an extrapolation to the continuum limit and improve the handling of systematic errors using renormalization-group resummation (RGR) and leading-renormalon resummation (LRR). Our final nucleon helicity PDF is renormalized in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme at energy scale $μ=2.0$ GeV. We compare our results with and without the two systematic improvements of RGR and LRR at each lattice spacing as well as the continuum limit, and we see that the application of RGR and LRR greatly reduces the systematic errors across the whole $x$ range. Our continuum results with both RGR and LRR show a small positive antiquark region for the nucleon helicity PDF as well as a change of as much as a factor of two in the central values compared to results with neither RGR or LRR. By contrast, the application of RGR and LRR only changes the central values by about 5\\% in the quark region. We compare our lattice results with the global fits by the JAM, NNPDF and DSSV collaborations, and we observe some tension between our results.",

      "title": "Impact of gauge fixing precision on the continuum limit of non-local quark-bilinear lattice operators",
      "summary": "We analyze the gauge fixing precision dependence of some non-local quark-blinear lattice operators interesting in computing parton physics for several measurements, using 5 lattice spacings ranging from 0.032 fm to 0.121 fm. Our results show that gauge dependent non-local measurements are significantly more sensitive to the precision of gauge fixing than anticipated. The impact of imprecise gauge fixing is significant for fine lattices and long distances. For instance, even with the typically defined precision of Landau gauge fixing of $10^{-8}$, the deviation caused by imprecise gauge fixing can reach 12 percent, when calculating the trace of Wilson lines at 1.2 fm with a lattice spacing of approximately 0.03 fm. Similar behavior has been observed in $ξ$ gauge and Coulomb gauge as well. For both quasi PDFs and quasi TMD-PDFs operators renormalized using the RI/MOM scheme, convergence for different lattice spacings at long distance is only observed when the precision of Landau gauge fixing is sufficiently high. To describe these findings quantitatively, we propose an empirical formula to estimate the required precision.",

Here, we study observables related to both aspects using lattice simulations: the Polyakov loop and its derivatives and the chiral condensate and its derivatives. At zero baryochemical potential, and infinite volume, the chiral and deconfinement crossover temperatures almost agree. However, chiral and deconfinement related observables have a qualitatively different chemical potential and volume dependence. In general, deconfinement related observables have a milder volume dependence. Furthermore, while the deconfinement transition appears to get broader with increasing $μ_B$, the width as well as the strength of the chiral transition is approximately constant. Our results are based on simulations at zero and imaginary chemical potentials using 4stout-improved staggered fermions with $N_τ=12$ time-slices and physical quark masses.",

One approach involves substituting the continuous gauge group with a discrete subgroup, but the implications of this approximation still need to be clarified. To gain insights, we investigate the subduction of $ SU(2) $ and $ SU(3)$ to discrete crystal-like subgroups. Using classical lattice calculations, we show that subduction offers valuable information based on subduced direct sums, helping us identify additional terms to incorporate into the lattice action that can mitigate the effects of digitization. Furthermore, we compute the static potentials of all irreducible representations of $ Σ(360 \\times 3) $ at a fixed lattice spacing. Our results reveal a percent-level agreement with the Casimir scaling of ( SU(3) ) for irreducible representations that subduce to a single $ Σ(360 \\times 3) $ irreducible representation. This provides a diagnostic measure of approximation quality, as some irreducible representations closely match the expected results while others exhibit significant deviations.",

      "summary": "In the early 80's Sanda-san and collaborators wrote key papers on the direct and clean determination of the unitarity angle $φ_1$ ($β$). This motivated many of us for analogously coming up with ways for direct and clean determinations of the other two unitarity angles, $φ_2 (α)$ and $φ_3 (γ)$. Current status of these direct determinations as well as our expectations for when Belle-II has 50 $ab^{-1}$ of luminosity and LHCb with some upgrades, will be given. In particular, it is emphasized that for direct determination of $φ_3$, Belle-II should be able to handle final states in $D^0$ or $\\bar D^0$ Dalitz decays, that contain one $π^0$ (which are difficult for LHCb) then they may make further inroads in improving the accuracy of $φ_3$ determination. Early lattice inputs for constraining the unitarity triangle (UT) are briefly recalled. Its crucial role in supporting the Kobayashi-Maskawa theory of CP violation is emphasized. Over the years lattice methods have made significant progress and latest constraints from these for the UT will be discussed as well as compatibility with current direct determinations and some comments on future outlook will be made.",

      "summary": "A framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of composite particles in a simple model of dense matter that is amenable to quantum computers is developed. As a demonstration, we perform classical simulations of heavy-hadrons propagating through a dense medium in the Schwinger model. Measurements of the time-dependent energy and charge density are used to identify mechanisms responsible for energy loss and hadron production (hadronization). A study of entanglement dynamics highlights the importance of quantum coherence between the particles that make up the dense medium. Throughout this work, care is taken to isolate, and remove, phenomena that arise solely from a finite lattice spacing. It is found that signatures of entanglement are more sensitive to lattice artifacts than other observables. Toward quantum simulations, we present an efficient method and the corresponding quantum circuits for preparing ground states in the presence of heavy mesons. These circuits are used to estimate the resources required to simulate in-medium energy loss and hadronization in the Schwinger model using quantum computers.",

      "summary": "We develop a new methodology for extracting Compton form factors (CFFs) in from deeply virtual exclusive reactions such as the unpolarized DVCS cross section using a specialized inverse problem solver, a variational autoencoder inverse mapper (VAIM). The VAIM-CFF framework not only allows us access to a fitted solution set possibly containing multiple solutions in the extraction of all 8 CFFs from a single cross section measurement, but also accesses the lost information contained in the forward mapping from CFFs to cross section. We investigate various assumptions and their effects on the predicted CFFs such as cross section organization, number of extracted CFFs, use of uncertainty quantification technique, and inclusion of prior physics information. We then use dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis to visualize the missing physics information tracked in the latent space of the VAIM framework. Through re-framing the extraction of CFFs as an inverse problem, we gain access to fundamental properties of the problem not comprehensible in standard fitting methodologies: exploring the limits of the information encoded in deeply virtual exclusive experiments.",

      "title": "Generalized parton distributions from the pseudo-distribution approach on the lattice",
      "summary": "Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) are key quantities for the description of a hadron's three-dimensional structure. They are the current focus of all areas of hadronic physics -- phenomenological, experimental, and theoretical, including lattice QCD. Synergies between these areas are desirable and essential to achieve precise quantification and understanding of the structure of, particularly nucleons, as the basic ingredients of matter. In this paper, we investigate, for the first time, the numerical implementation of the pseudo-distribution approach for the extraction of zero-skewness GPDs for unpolarized quarks. Pseudo-distributions are Euclidean parton correlators computable in lattice QCD that can be perturbatively matched to the light-cone parton distributions of interest. Being closely related to the quasi-distributions and coming from the same lattice-extracted matrix elements, they are, however, subject to different systematic effects. We use the data previously utilized for quasi-GPDs and extend it with other momentum transfers and nucleon boosts, in particular a higher one ($P_3=1.67$ GeV) with eight-fold larger statistics than the largest one used for quasi-distributions ($P_3=1.25$ GeV). We renormalize the matrix elements with a ratio scheme and match the resulting Ioffe time distributions to the light cone in coordinate space. The matched distributions are then used to reconstruct the $x$-dependence with a fitting ansatz.We investigate some systematic effects related to this procedure, and we also compare the results with the ones obtained in the framework of quasi-GPDs. Our final results involve the invariant four-momentum transfer squared ($-t$) dependence of the flavor non-singlet ($u-d$) $H$ and $E$ GPDs.",

      "summary": "Staggered fermion shift symmetries correspond to translations of the fermion field within the unit cell of a hypercubic lattice. They satisfy an algebra and in four Euclidean dimensions can be related to a discrete subgroup of an $SU(4)$ flavor symmetry which plays a crucial role in showing that staggered fermions lead to a theory of four degenerate Dirac fermions in the continuum limit. They are associated with the appearance of certain $Z_2$ valued global parameters. We propose a strategy to try to partially gauge these translation symmetries by allowing these parameters to vary locally in the lattice. To maintain invariance of the action requires the addition of $Z_2$ valued higher form lattice gauge fields. An analogous procedure can be carried out for reduced staggered fermions where the shifts correspond to a discrete subgroup of an $SO(4)$ flavor symmetry.",

      "summary": "X-space schemes are gauge-invariant, regulator-independent renormalization schemes that are defined by requiring position-space correlation functions of gauge invariant operators to be equal to their noninteracting values at particular kinematic points. These schemes can be used to nonperturbatively renormalize composite operators in Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD), and by computing matching coefficients between the X-space scheme and MSbar in the dimensionally-regulated continuum, matrix elements calculated with LQCD can be converted to MSbar-renormalized matrix elements. Using X-space schemes for Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) operators has the additional benefit that appropriate ratios of position-space correlation functions cancel the power divergent static-quark self-energy of Lattice HQET nonperturbatively. This work presents the O($α_S$) matching coefficients between X-space renormalized four-quark flavor-nonsinglet HQET operators relevant for the lifetimes of charm- and bottom-hadrons, and four-quark HQET operators relevant for mixing between neutral mesons containing a heavy quark, such as B-Bbar mixing.",

We use lattice ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration at lattice spacing $a\\approx 0.09$~fm, lattice volume $64^3\\times 96$, $N_f=2+1+1$ flavors of highly-improved staggered quarks and a physical pion mass. The LaMET matrix elements are calculated with pions boosted to momentum $P_z\\approx 1.72$~GeV with high-statistics of $O(10^6)$ measurements. We study the pion PDF in both hybrid-ratio and hybrid-regularization-independent momentum subtraction (hybrid-RI/MOM) schemes and also compare the systematic errors with and without the addition of leading-renormalon resummation (LRR) and renormalization-group resummation (RGR) in both the renormalization and lightcone matching. The final lightcone PDF results are presented in the modified minimal-subtraction scheme at renormalization scale $μ=2.0$~GeV. We show that the $x$-dependent PDFs are compatible between the hybrid-ratio and hybrid-RI/MOM renormalization with the same improvements. We also show that systematics are greatly reduced by the simultaneous inclusion of RGR and LRR and that these methods are necessary if improved precision is to be reached with higher-order terms in renormalization and matching.",

To that end, we perform a point-wise continuum limit of the staggered density in lattice QCD with staggered quarks. We find, for the first time, that a clear infrared structure (IR peak) emerges in the density of Dirac operator describing dynamical quarks. We also provide numerical evidence that a component of this peak, which becomes dominant in the thermodynamic limit, is due to a non-trivial accumulation of near-zero modes. Features of this structure are consistent with those previously attributed to the recently-proposed IR phase of thermal QCD. Our results (i) provide the only complete first-principles evidence that these IR features exist and are physical; (ii) improve the upper bound for IR-phase transition temperature $T_{\\mathrm{IR}}$ so that the new window is $200 < T_{\\mathrm{IR}} < 230\\,$MeV; (iii) are consistent with non-restoration of anomalous U$_{\\mathrm A}$(1) symmetry (chiral limit) below $T = 230$ MeV.",

      "summary": "The low-energy finite-volume spectrum of the two-nucleon system at a quark mass corresponding to a pion mass of $m_π\\approx 806$ MeV is studied with lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) using variational methods. The interpolating-operator sets used in [Phys.Rev.D 107 (2023) 9, 094508] are extended by including a complete basis of local hexaquark operators, as well as plane-wave dibaryon operators built from products of both positive- and negative-parity nucleon operators. Results are presented for the isosinglet and isotriplet two-nucleon channels. In both channels, noticably weaker variational bounds on the lowest few energy eigenvalues are obtained from operator sets which contain only hexaquark operators or operators constructed from the product of two negative-parity nucleons, while other operator sets produce low-energy variational bounds which are consistent within statistical uncertainties. The consequences of these studies for the LQCD understanding of the two-nucleon spectrum are investigated.",

Previous work on normalizing flows has been able to utilize scale separation in the context of scalar field theories, but the principle has been largely unexploited in the context of gauge theories. This work gives an overview of a new method for generating gauge fields using hierarchical normalizing flow models. This method builds gauge fields from the outside in, allowing different parts of the model to focus on different scales of the problem. Numerical results are presented for $U(1)$ and $SU(3)$ gauge theories in 2, 3, and 4 spacetime dimensions.",

      "summary": "We discuss the possibility of estimating experimentally the von Neumann entanglement entropy $S_{A}^{vN}$ of a symmetric bi-partite quantum system $AB$ by using the basic measurement counts (bitstrings) for a $single$ copy of a prepared state. Using exact diagonalization and analog simulations performed with the publicly available QuEra facilities for chains and ladders of Rydberg atoms, we calculate the Shannon entropy $S_{AB}^X$ associated with the bitstrings of adiabatically prepared ground states and the reduced entropies $S_A^X$ and $S_B^X$ obtained from the marginal probabilities in $A$ and $B$. We then calculate the classical mutual information $I^X_{AB}=S_A^X+S_B^X-S_{AB}^X$, which is a lower bound on $S_{A}^{vN}$. We show that for a broad range of lattice spacing and detuning, $I^X_{AB}$ is typically 20 percent below $S_{A}^{vN}$ in regions where $S_{A}^{vN}$ is large and a less close bound in regions where $S_{A}^{vN}$ is low. We argue that this use of the easily available bitstrings provides a robust and efficient way to explore empirically the phase diagram of qubit-based quantum simulators and identify critical regions.",

The latter is particularly important for future finite-volume scattering analyses. Here, we perform chiral and continuum extrapolations of just the ground-state energies, for which finite-volume effects are expected to be small.

Classical-computing methods, via the framework of lattice gauge theory, have experienced limited success in this mission. Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories holds promise for overcoming computational limitations. Because of local constraints (Gauss's laws), lattice gauge theories have an intricate Hilbert-space structure. This structure complicates the definition of thermodynamic properties of systems coupled to reservoirs during equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes. We show how to define thermodynamic quantities such as work and heat using strong-coupling thermodynamics, a framework that has recently burgeoned within the field of quantum thermodynamics. Our definitions suit instantaneous quenches, simple nonequilibrium processes undertaken in quantum simulators. To illustrate our framework, we compute the work and heat exchanged during a quench in a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to matter in 1+1 dimensions. The thermodynamic quantities, as functions of the quench parameter, evidence a phase transition. For general thermal states, we derive a simple relation between a quantum many-body system's entanglement Hamiltonian, measurable with quantum-information-processing tools, and the Hamiltonian of mean force, used to define strong-coupling thermodynamic quantities.",

      "summary": "We present non-perturbative results for beyond the standard model kaon mixing matrix elements in the isospin symmetric limit ($m_u=m_d$) of QCD, including a complete estimate of all dominant sources of systematic error. Our results are obtained from numerical simulations of lattice QCD with $N_f = 2+1$ flavours of dynamical domain wall fermions. For the first time, these quantities are simulated directly at the physical pion mass $m_π$~$\\sim$~$139\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ for two different lattice spacings. We include data at three lattice spacings in the range $a = 0.11 $ - $ 0.07\\,\\mathrm{fm}$ and with pion masses ranging from the physical value up to 450$\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$. Compared to our earlier work, we have added both direct calculations at physical quark masses and a third lattice spacing making the removal of discretisation effects significantly more precise and eliminating the need for any significant mass extrapolation beyond the range of simulated data. We renormalise the lattice operators non-perturbatively using RI-SMOM off-shell schemes. These schemes eliminate the need to model and subtract non-perturbative pion poles that arises in the RI-MOM scheme and, since the calculations are performed with domain wall fermions, the unphysical mixing between chirality sectors is suppressed. Our results for the bag parameters in the $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme at $3\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$ are $B_K~\\equiv~\\mathcal{B}_1 = 0.5240(17)(54)$, $\\mathcal{B}_2 = 0.4794(25)(35)$, $\\mathcal{B}_3 = 0.746(13)(17)$, $\\mathcal{B}_4 = 0.897(02)(10)$ and $\\mathcal{B}_5 = 0.6882(78)(94)$, where the first error is from lattice uncertainties and the second is the uncertainty due to the perturbative matching to $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$.",

The calculations are carried out on three gauge ensembles with different lattice spacings, which enable us to do the continuum extrapolation.

      "summary": "We generalize previous three-particle finite-volume formalisms to allow for multiple three-particle channels. For definiteness, we focus on the two-channel $ηππ$ and $K \\overline K π$ system in isosymmetric QCD, considering the positive $G$ parity sector of the latter channel, and neglecting the coupling to modes with four or more particles. The formalism we obtain is thus appropriate to study the $b_1(1235)$ and $η(1295)$ resonances. The derivation is made in the generic relativistic field theory approach using the time-ordered perturbation theory method. We study how the resulting quantization condition reduces to that for a single three-particle channel when one drops below the upper ($K\\overline K π$) threshold. We also present parametrizations of the three-particle K matrices that enter into the formalism.",

      "summary": "Lightcone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of heavy meson within heavy quark effective theory (HQET) are crucial for predicting physical observables in $B$ decays, but unfortunately there is no first-principle result due to severe challenges. After analyzing these challenges, we propose a realistic method to determine heavy meson LCDA. We utilize equal-time correlations and incorporate a dynamic quark field for a fast moving heavy quark. To verify this method, we make use of lattice QCD simulation on a lattice ensemble with spacing $a = 0.05187$\\,fm. The preliminary findings for HQET LCDAs qualitatively align with phenomenological models, and the fitted result for the first inverse moment $λ_B^{-1}$ is consistent with the experimentally constrain from $B \\to γ\\ellν_\\ell$. We explore how our findings can reduce model uncertainties in predictions of heavy-to-light form factors at large recoil. These results demonstrate the promise of our method in providing first-principle predictions for heavy meson LCDAs.",

Recent advances in parallel gate applications, along with the shorter application times of single-qudit operations compared with two-qudit operations, lead to significant projected advantages in quantum simulation fidelities and circuit depths using qu8its rather than qubits. The number of two-qudit entangling gates required for time evolution using qu8its is found to be more than a factor of five fewer than for qubits. We anticipate that the developments presented in this work will enable improved quantum simulations to be performed using emerging quantum hardware.",

To deal with the topological freezing of standard local algorithms, the definition of the coupling is usually projected onto the zero topological sector. However, it is not obvious that this definition is not biased by the loss of ergodicity. We instead avoid the topological freezing using a novel algorithm, the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions. The comparison with a standard algorithm shows that, even in the case where the latter is severely frozen, one obtains the same projected coupling. Moreover, we show that the two definitions of the coupling, projected and non-projected, lead to the same flow of the renormalization scale. Our results imply that projecting the coupling does not affect the determination of the dynamically-generated scale of the theory $Λ$, as obtained through the step-scaling method.",

The difference among the partial widths $Γ(J/ψ\\to γη_{(N_f)})$ at different $N_f$ can be attributed in part to the $\\mathbf{U}_A(1)$ anomaly that induces a $N_f$ scaling. $M(q^2)$'s in $N_f=1,2$ are both well described by the single pole model $M(q^2)=M(0)/(1-q^2/Λ^2)$. Combined with the known experimental results of the Dalitz decays $J/ψ\\to Pe^+e^-$, the pseudoscalar mass $m_P$ dependence of the pole parameter $Λ$ is approximated by $Λ(m_P^2)=Λ_1(1-m_P^2/Λ_2^2)$ with $Λ_1=2.64(4)~\\mathrm{GeV}$ and $Λ_2=2.97(33)~\\mathrm{GeV}$.

The resulting levels are described using a simple model Hamiltonian and the parameters in this model are extrapolated to the physical light-quark masses.

Motivated by these studies, this work presents a general algorithm to construct multi-particle interpolating operators for quantum field theories with cubic symmetry.

      "summary": "We present a lattice QCD calculation of the rapidity anomalous dimension of quark transverse-momentum-dependent distributions, i.e., the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel, up to transverse separations of about 1 fm. This unitary lattice calculation is conducted, for the first time, employing the chiral-symmetry-preserving domain wall fermion discretization and physical values of light and strange quark masses. The CS kernel is extracted from the ratios of pion quasi-transverse-momentum-dependent wave functions (quasi-TMDWFs) at next-to-leading logarithmic perturbative accuracy. Also for the first time, we utilize the recently proposed Coulomb-gauge-fixed quasi-TMDWF correlator without a Wilson line. We observe significantly slower signal decay with increasing quark separations compared to the established gauge-invariant method with a staple-shaped Wilson line. This enables us to determine the CS kernel at large nonperturbative transverse separations and find its near-linear dependence on the latter. Our result is consistent with the recent lattice calculation using gauge-invariant quasi-TMDWFs, and agrees with various recent phenomenological parametrizations of experimental data.",

While gauge-fixing reduces the number of qubits, keeping the gauge redundancy can provide code space to mitigate and correct quantum errors by checking and restoring Gauss's law. In this work, we consider the correctable errors for generic finite gauge groups and design the quantum circuits to detect and correct them. We calculate the error thresholds below which the gauge-redundant digitization with Gauss's law error correction has better fidelity than the gauge-fixed digitization.

Our motivation to construct the method comes from our interest in studying renormalization of chiral nuclear effective field theory with lattice regularization. In particular we wish to apply our method to compute the lattice spacing dependence of local lattice interactions as we take the continuum limit of the lattice theory. Our algorithm can compute matrix elements of the operator $\\exp(-βH)$ where $H$ is the lattice Hamiltonian and $β$ is a free real parameter. These elements help us compute deep bound states that are well separated from scattering states even at values of $β$ which are not very large. Computing these bound state energies accurately can help us study renormalization of the lattice theory. In addition to developing the algorithm, in this work we also introduce a finite volume renormalization scheme for the lattice Hamiltonian of the leading pionless effective field theory and show how it would work in the one and two body sectors.",

The analysis of $E_{2,3}$ using the effective range expansion (ERE) comes out with a shallow bound state below the $D\\bar{D}^*$ threshold, and the phase shifts at $E_{3,4}$ indicate the possible existence of a resonance near 4.0 GeV. We also perform a joint analysis to $E_{2,3,4}$ through the $K$-matrix parameterization of the scattering amplitude. In this way, we observe a $D\\bar{D}^*$ bound state whose properties are almost the same as that from the ERE analysis. At each $m_π$, this joint analysis also results in a resonance pole with a mass slightly above 4.0 GeV and a width around 40-60 MeV, which are compatible with the properties of the newly observed $χ_{c1}(4010)$ by LHCb.

      "summary": "The reduction and distortion of quantum correlations in the presence of classical noise leads to varied levels of inefficiency in the availability of entanglement as a resource for quantum information processing protocols. While generically minimizing required entanglement for mixed quantum states remains challenging, a class of many-body Gaussian quantum states ($\\mathcal{N}$IC) is here identified that exhibits two-mode bipartite entanglement structure, resembling that of pure states, for which the logarithmic negativity entanglement measure remains invariant upon inclusion of the classical correlations and optimal entanglement resources can be clearly quantified. This subclass is found to be embedded within a broader class of many-body Gaussian states ($\\mathcal{N}$-SOL) that retain two-mode entanglement structure for detection processes. These two entanglement classes are relevant in theoretical and experimental applications from the scalar field vacuum to the local axial motional modes of trapped ion chains. Utilizing the subspace that heralds inseparability in response to partial transposition, a minimum noise filtering process is designed to be necessary, sufficient, and computable for determining membership in these classes of entanglement structure. Application of this process to spacelike regions of the free scalar field vacuum is found to improve resource upper bounds, providing new understanding of the entanglement required for the quantum simulation of quantum fields as observed by arrays of local detectors.",

      "summary": "Recently, formalism has been derived for studying electroweak transition amplitudes for three-body systems both in infinite and finite volumes. The formalism provides exact relations that the infinite-volume amplitudes must satisfy, as well as a relationship between physical amplitudes and finite-volume matrix elements, which can be constrained from lattice QCD calculations. This formalism poses additional challenges when compared with the analogous well-studied two-body equivalent one, including the necessary step of solving integral equations of singular functions. In this work, we provide some non-trivial analytical and numerical tests on the aforementioned formalism. In particular, we consider a case where the three-particle system can have three-body bound states as well as bound states in the two-body subsystem. For kinematics below the three-body threshold, we demonstrate that the scattering amplitudes satisfy unitarity. We also check that for these kinematics the finite-volume matrix elements are accurately described by the formalism for two-body systems up to exponentially suppressed corrections. Finally, we verify that in the case of the three-body bound state, the finite-volume matrix element is equal to the infinite-volume coupling of the bound state, up to exponentially suppressed errors.",

The use of the highly improved action, combined with the MILC collaboration's gauge ensembles with lattice spacings down to $\\sim$0.03 fm, allows the $b$ quark to be treated with the same discretization as the lighter quarks. The talk will focus on updated results for $B_{(s)} \\to D_{(s)}$, $B_{(s)} \\to K$ scalar and vector form factors.",

      "summary": "Neutrinoless double-beta ($0νββ$) decay is a heretofore unobserved process which, if observed, would imply that neutrinos are Majorana particles. Interpretations of the stringent experimental constraints on $0νββ$-decay half-lives require calculations of nuclear matrix elements. This work presents the first lattice quantum-chromodynamics (LQCD) calculation of the matrix element for $0νββ$ decay in a multi-nucleon system, specifically the $nn \\rightarrow pp ee$ transition, mediated by a light left-handed Majorana neutrino propagating over nuclear-scale distances. This calculation is performed with quark masses corresponding to a pion mass of $m_π= 806$ MeV at a single lattice spacing and volume. The statistically cleaner $Σ^- \\rightarrow Σ^+ ee$ transition is also computed in order to investigate various systematic uncertainties. The prospects for matching the results of LQCD calculations onto a nuclear effective field theory to determine a leading-order low-energy constant relevant for $0νββ$ decay with a light Majorana neutrino are investigated. This work, therefore, sets the stage for future calculations at physical values of the quark masses that, combined with effective field theory and nuclear many-body studies, will provide controlled theoretical inputs to experimental searches of $0νββ$ decay.",

The lightest baryon in this theory can be a potential dark matter candidate as it is protected from decay and hence can evade detection with a mass of just a few GeV.

Next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic matching is used to match lattice-calculable distributions to the corresponding TMDs.

This work develops machine learning algorithms to overcome this difficulty by approximating exact quantum states with neural network parametrisations, specifically Neural Density Operators. As a proof of principle demonstration in a QCD-like theory, the approach is applied to solve the Lindblad master equation in the 1+1d lattice Schwinger Model as an open quantum system. Neural Density Operators enable the study of in-medium dynamics on large lattice volumes, where multiple-string interactions and their effects on string-breaking and recombination phenomena can be studied. Thermal properties of the system at equilibrium can also be probed with these methods by variationally constructing the steady state of the Lindblad master equation. Scaling of this approach with system size is studied, and numerical demonstrations on up to 32 spatial lattice sites and with up to 3 interacting strings are performed.",

      "title": "Scattering wave packets of hadrons in gauge theories: Preparation on a quantum computer",
      "summary": "Quantum simulation holds promise of enabling a complete description of high-energy scattering processes rooted in gauge theories of the Standard Model. A first step in such simulations is preparation of interacting hadronic wave packets. To create the wave packets, one typically resorts to adiabatic evolution to bridge between wave packets in the free theory and those in the interacting theory, rendering the simulation resource intensive. In this work, we construct a wave-packet creation operator directly in the interacting theory to circumvent adiabatic evolution, taking advantage of resource-efficient schemes for ground-state preparation, such as variational quantum eigensolvers. By means of an ansatz for bound mesonic excitations in confining gauge theories, which is subsequently optimized using classical or quantum methods, we show that interacting mesonic wave packets can be created efficiently and accurately using digital quantum algorithms that we develop. Specifically, we obtain high-fidelity mesonic wave packets in the $Z_2$ and $U(1)$ lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter in 1+1 dimensions. Our method is applicable to both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes of couplings. The wave-packet creation circuit for the case of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory is built and implemented on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer using 13 qubits and up to 308 entangling gates. The fidelities agree well with classical benchmark calculations after employing a simple symmetry-based noise-mitigation technique. This work serves as a step toward quantum computing scattering processes in quantum chromodynamics.",

      "summary": "I present an overview of the calculations of the isovector axial vector form factor of the nucleon, $G_A(Q^2)$, using lattice QCD. Based on a comparison of results from various collaborations, a case is made that lattice results are now consistent within 10\\%. A similar level of uncertainty is found also in the axial charge $g_A^{u-d}$, the mean squared axial charge radius, $\\langle r_A^2 \\rangle$, the induced pseudoscalar charge $g_P^\\ast$, and the pion-nucleon coupling $g_{πNN}$. These lattice results for $G_A(Q^2)$ are already compatible with those obtained from the recent MINER$ν$A experiment but lie 2-3$σ$ higher than the phenomenological extraction from the old $ν$-deuterium bubble chamber scattering data for $Q^2 > 0.3$~GeV${}^2$. Fits to our data show that the dipole ansatz does not have enough parameters to parameterize the form factor over the range $0 \\le Q^2 \\le 1$~GeV${}^2$, whereas even a $z^2$ truncation of the $z$-expansion or a low order Padé are sufficient. Looking ahead, lattice QCD calculations will provide increasingly precise results over the range $0 \\le Q^2 \\lesssim 1$~GeV${}^2$, and MINER$ν$A-like experiments will extend the range to $Q^2 \\sim 2$~GeV${}^2$ or higher. To increase precision of lattice data to the percent level, new developments are needed to address two related issues: the exponentially falling signal-to-noise ratio in all nucleon correlation functions and removing excited state contributions. Nevertheless, even with the current methodology, significant reduction in errors is expected over the next few years with higher statistics data on more ensembles closer to the physical point.",

Dirichlet boundary conditions are chosen for the fermions. Quantum fluctuations of the geometry are included by summing over all possible triangulations consistent with these constraints. We show in the limit $N\\to \\infty$ that the partition function is dominated by a regular triangulation of two dimensional hyperbolic space. We use strong coupling expansions and Monte Carlo simulation to show that in this limit boundary correlators of the fermions have a power law dependence on boundary separation as one expects from holography. However we argue that this behavior breaks down for any finite number of massive fields in the thermodynamic limit and quantum fluctuations of the bulk geometry drive the theory into a non-holographic phase. In contrast, for massless fermions we find evidence that the boundary is conformal even for finite $N$. This is consistent with theoretical results in quantum Liouville theory.",

      "summary": "We reveal that the criticality of the chiral phase transition in QCD at the macroscale arises from the microscopic energy levels of its fundamental constituents, the quarks. We establish a novel relation between cumulants of the chiral order parameter (i.e., chiral condensate) and correlations among the energy levels of quarks (i.e., eigenspectra of the massless Dirac operator), which naturally leads to a generalization of the Banks-Casher relation. Based on this novel relation and through (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD calculations using the HISQ action with varying light quark masses in the vicinity of the chiral phase transition, we demonstrate that the correlations among the infrared part of the Dirac eigenspectra exhibit same universal scaling behaviors as expected of the cumulants of the chiral condensate. We find that these universal scaling behaviors extend up to the physical values of the up and down quark masses.",

This work demonstrates how these correlations can be exploited for variance reduction in the computation of observables. Three different proof-of-concept applications are demonstrated using a novel residual flow architecture: continuum limits of gauge theories, the mass dependence of QCD observables, and hadronic matrix elements based on the Feynman-Hellmann approach. In all three cases, it is shown that statistical uncertainties are significantly reduced when machine-learned flows are incorporated as compared with the same calculations performed with uncorrelated ensembles or direct reweighting.",

Reconstruction of spectral functions from Euclidean lattice correlators is an ill-posed problem. Despite a variety of techniques developed recently, many questions remain unresolved.

We report on our first study with anisotropic improved staggered quarks. To compute the spectrum of the anisotropic Highly Improved Staggered Quarks (aHISQ) we generated a library of anisotropic pure gauge ensembles. We discuss the gauge anisotropy tuning that is performed with the Wilson and Symanzik gradient flow, as well as tuning of the strange quark mass and quark anisotropy with aHISQ, using spectrum measurements on quenched ensembles. Finally, we discuss the impact of anisotropy on pion taste splittings for aHISQ.",

      "summary": "The Bielefeld Parma Collaboration has in recent years put forward a method to probe finite density QCD by the detection of Lee-Yang singularities. The location of the latter is obtained by multi-point Padè approximants, which are in turn calculated matching Taylor series results obtained from Monte Carlo computations at (a variety of values of) imaginary baryonic chemical potential. The method has been successfully applied to probe the Roberge Weiss phase transition and preliminary, interesting results are showing up in the vicinity of a possible QCD critical endpoint candidate. In this talk we will be concerned with a couple of significant aspects in view of a more powerful application of the method. First, we will discuss the possibility of detecting finite size scaling of Lee-Yang/Fisher singularities in finite density (lattice) QCD. Second, we will briefly mention our attempts at detecting both singularities in the complex chemical potential plane and singularities in the complex temperature plane. The former are obtained from rational approximations which are functions of the chemical potential at given values of the temperature; the latter are obtained from rational approximations which are functions of the temperature at given values of the chemical potential.",

      "summary": "Using $N_f=2+1$ QCD calculations at physical quark mass and purely imaginary baryon chemical potential, we locate Lee-Yang edge singularities in the complex chemical potential plane. These singularities have been obtained by the multi-point Padé approach applied to the net baryon number density. We recently showed that singularities extracted with this approach are consistent with universal scaling near the Roberge-Weiss transition. Here we study the universal scaling of these singularities in the vicinity of the QCD critical endpoint. Making use of an appropriate scaling ansatz, we extrapolate these singularities on $N_τ=6$ and $N_τ=8$ lattices towards the real axis to estimate the position of a possible QCD critical point. We find an approach toward the real axis with decreasing temperature. We compare this estimate with a HotQCD estimate obtained from poles of a [4,4]-Padé resummation of the eighth-order Taylor expansion of the QCD pressure.",

      "summary": "Hadron wavepackets are prepared and time evolved in the Schwinger model using 112 qubits of IBM's 133-qubit Heron quantum computer ibm_torino. The initialization of the hadron wavepacket is performed in two steps. First, the vacuum is prepared across the whole lattice using the recently developed SC-ADAPT-VQE algorithm and workflow. SC-ADAPT-VQE is then extended to the preparation of localized states, and used to establish a hadron wavepacket on top of the vacuum. This is done by adaptively constructing low-depth circuits that maximize the overlap with an adiabatically prepared hadron wavepacket. Due to the localized nature of the wavepacket, these circuits can be determined on a sequence of small lattices using classical computers, and then robustly scaled to prepare wavepackets on large lattices for simulations using quantum computers. Time evolution is implemented with a second-order Trotterization. To reduce both the required qubit connectivity and circuit depth, an approximate quasi-local interaction is introduced. This approximation is made possible by the emergence of confinement at long distances, and converges exponentially with increasing distance of the interactions. Using multiple error-mitigation strategies, up to 14 Trotter steps of time evolution are performed, employing 13,858 two-qubit gates (with a CNOT depth of 370). The propagation of hadrons is clearly identified, with results that compare favorably with Matrix Product State simulations. Prospects for a near-term quantum advantage in simulations of hadron scattering are discussed.",

We describe two complementary methods to extract the location of the Yang-Lee singularity from lattice QCD data of the baryon-number density and higher order cumulants of the baryon number, obtained at imaginary chemical potential. The first method (multi-point Padé resummation) is used to determine the Roberge-Weiss phase transition temperature. Our continuum extrapolated result is $T_{RW}=211.1\\pm3.1$ MeV. The second method is based on the asymptotic behaviour of the Fourier coefficients of the baryon-number density. We discuss the derivation of a fitting function and demonstrate that the procedure can successfully locate the YLs in the Quark Meson model.",

      "summary": "Other than the commonly used Wilson's regularization of quantum field theories (QFTs), there is a growing interest in regularizations that explore lattice models with a strictly finite local Hilbert space, in anticipation of the upcoming era of quantum simulations of QFTs. A notable example is Euclidean qubit regularization, which provides a natural way to recover continuum QFTs that emerge via infrared fixed points of lattice theories. Can such regularizations also capture the physics of ultraviolet fixed points? We present a novel regularization of the asymptotically free massive continuum QFT that emerges at the Berezenski-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition through a hard core loop-gas model, discussing the advantages this model provides compared to traditional regularizations. In particular, we demonstrate that without the need for fine-tuning, it can reproduce the universal step-scaling function of the classical lattice XY model in the massive phase as we approach the phase transition.",

      "summary": "The two dimensional O(3) sigma model, just as quantum chromodynamics, is an asymptotically free theory with a mass gap. Therefore, it is an interesting and simple toy model to investigate algorithms for Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations of quantum chromodynamics. In this talk, we discuss the construction of a trivializing map, a field transformation from a given theory to a trivial one, through a suitably chosen gradient flow. An analytic solution for the generating functional of this trivializing flow has been obtained by a perturbative expansion in the flow time. Utilizing this solution allows for new approaches to be considered when proposing updates for a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm.",

      "summary": "The hadron mass can be obtained through the calculation of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor in the hadron which includes the trace anomaly and sigma terms. The anomaly due to conformal symmetry breaking is believed to be an important ingredient for hadron mass generation and confinement. In this work, we will present the calculation of the glue part of the trace anomaly form factors of the pion up to $Q^2\\sim 4.3~\\mathrm{GeV}^2$ and the nucleon up to $Q^2\\sim 1~\\mathrm{GeV}^2$. The calculations are performed on a domain wall fermion ensemble with overlap valence quarks at seven valence pion masses varying from $\\sim 250$ to $\\sim 540$ MeV, including the unitary point $\\sim 340$ MeV. We calculate the radius of the glue trace anomaly for the pion and the nucleon from the $z$ expansion. By performing a two-dimensional Fourier transform on the glue trace anomaly form factors in the infinite momentum frame with no energy transfer, we also obtain their spatial distributions for several valence quark masses. The results are qualitatively extrapolated to the physical valence pion mass with systematic errors from the unphysical sea quark mass, discretization effects in the renormalization sum rule, and finite-volume effects to be addressed in the future. We find the pion's form factor changes sign, as does its spatial distribution, for light quark masses. This explains how the trace anomaly contribution to the pion mass approaches zero toward the chiral limit.",

The corresponding matrix elements allow us to extract the scalar and tensor charges, as well as $\\langle x^n \\rangle$ with $n=1,2,3$. In addition, we introduce momentum transfer between the initial and final meson state that leads to the scalar, vector, and tensor form factors, and the generalized form factors up to three covariant derivatives. The above results are obtained using two ensembles of maximally twisted mass fermions with clover improvement with two degenerate light, a strange, and a charm quark $(N_f=2+1+1)$ at lattice spacings of 0.093 fm and 0.081 fm. The pion mass of the ensembles is about 260 MeV. We study excited-states effects by analyzing four values of the source-sink time separation (1.12 - 1.67 fm). We also examine discretization and volume effects. The lattice data are renormalized non-perturbatively, and the results are presented in the MS scheme at a scale of 2 GeV.",

      "summary": "We employ a thermodynamic $T$-matrix approach to study Wilson line correlators (WLCs) for a static quark-antiquark pair within the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). By refining earlier determined input parameters, self-consistent $T$-matrix calculations can approximately reproduce the WLCs from 2+1-flavor lattice-QCD (lQCD) computations, while also satisfying constraints on the bulk medium from the QGP equation of state. The main difference from earlier results is a reduced screening in the input potential toward higher temperatures. When elaborating the consequences of this scenario on transport properties we find a more pronounced temperature dependence of the low-momentum relaxation rate of heavy quarks in the QGP. This, in particular, leads to a rather weak increase of the (temperature-scaled) spatial diffusion coefficient, which turns out to be in fair agreement with the most recent pertinent lQCD data.",

We find that the repulsive interactions improve the agreement with the lattice results on the derivatives of the pressure with respect to the baryon chemical potential up to eighth order. From the temperature dependence of the chiral condensate we estimate the crossover temperature as a function of baryon chemical potential, $T_{pc}(μ_B)$. We find that the chiral crossover line starts to deviate significantly from the chemical freeze-out line already for $μ_B>400$ MeV. Furthermore, we find that the chiral pseudocritical line can be parametrized as $T_{pc}(μ_B)/T_{pc}(0)=1-κ_2 (μ_B/T_{pc} (0))^2-κ_4 (μ_B/T_{pc} (0))^4$ with $κ_2=0.0150(2)$ and $κ_4=3.1(6) \\times 10^{-5}$, which are in agreement with lattice QCD results for small values of $μ_B$.

      "summary": "In this study, we investigate Trotter evolution in the Gross-Neveu and hyperbolic Ising models in two spacetime dimensions, using quantum computers. We identify different sources of errors prevalent in various quantum processing units and discuss challenges to scale up the size of the computation. We present benchmark results obtained on a variety of platforms and employ a range of error mitigation techniques to address coherent and incoherent noise. By comparing these mitigated outcomes with exact diagonalization results and density matrix renormalization group calculations, we assess the effectiveness of our approaches. Moreover, we demonstrate the implementation of an out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) protocol using IBM's quantum computers.",

      "summary": "We numerically address the issue of which monopole operators are relevant under renormalization group flow in three-dimensional parity-invariant noncompact QED with $4$ flavors of massless two-component Dirac fermion. Using lattice simulation and finite-size scaling analysis of the free energy to introduce monopole-antimonopole pairs in $N=4$ and $N=12$ flavor noncompact QED$_3$, we estimate the infrared scaling dimensions of monopole operators that introduce $2π$ and $4π$ fluxes around them. We first show that the estimates for the monopole scaling dimensions are consistent with the large-$N$ expectations for $N=12$ QED$_3$. Applying the same procedure in $N=4$ QED$_3$, we estimate the scaling dimension of $4π$ flux monopole operator to be $3.7(3)$, which allows the possibility of the operator being irrelevant. This finding offers support to the scenario in which higher-flux monopoles are irrelevant deformations to the Dirac spin liquid phase that could be realized on certain non-bipartite lattices by forbidding $2π$-flux monopoles.",

      "summary": "We reveal that the universal scaling properties of the chiral phase transition in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at the macroscale are, in fact, encoded within the microscopic energy levels of its fundamental constituents, the quarks. We introduce a novel relation between the cumulants of the chiral order parameter, i.e., the chiral condensate, and the correlations among the energy levels of quarks, i.e., the eigenspectra of the massless QCD Dirac operator. This relation elucidates how the fluctuations of the chiral condensate arise from the correlations within the infrared part of the energy spectra of quarks, and naturally leads to a generalization of the Banks-Casher relation for the cumulants of the chiral condensate. Then, through (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD calculations using HISQ action with varying light quark masses around the chiral phase transition temperature, we demonstrate that the correlations among the infrared part of the Dirac eigenvalue spectra exhibit same universal scaling behaviors as expected of the cumulants of the chiral condensate. We find that these universal scaling behaviors extend up to the physical values of the up and down quark masses.",

These operators enter the first-principle calculation of transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) in lattice QCD using the formulation of Large Momentum Effective Theory. We provide appropriate RI$'$-type conditions that address the power and logarithmic divergences, as well as the mixing among staple operators of different Dirac structures, using a number of different possible projectors. A variant of RI$'$, including calculations of rectangular Wilson loops, which cancel the pinch-pole singularities of the staple operators at infinite length and reduce residual power divergences, is also employed. We calculate at one-loop order the conversion matrix, which relates the quasi-TMDPDFs in the RI$'$-type schemes to the reference scheme $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ for arbitrary values of the renormalization momentum scale and of the dimensions of the staple.",
