      "summary": "We present a study of charmonia in hot gluonic plasma, for temperatures upto three times the deconfinement transition temperature Tc. q \\bar{q} systems with quark masses close to the charm mass and different spin-parity quantum numbers were studied on very fine isotropic lattices. The analysis of temporal correlators, and spectral functions constructed from them, shows that the J/psi and eta_c survive up to quite high temperatures, with little observable change up to 1.5 Tc, and then gradually weakening and disappearing by 3 Tc. For the scalar and axial vector channels, serious modifications are induced by the hot medium already close to Tc, possibly dissociating the mesons by 1.1 Tc.",

      "summary": "The topological charge is studied on lattices of large physical volume and fine lattice spacing. We illustrate how a parity transformation on the SU(3) link-variables of lattice gauge configurations reverses the sign of the topological charge and leaves the action invariant. Random applications of the parity transformation are proposed to traverse from one topological charge sign to the other. The transformation provides an improved unbiased estimator of the ensemble average and is essential in improving the ergodicity of the Markov chain process.",

Since fermions in the fundamental representation are naturally quenched in the large N limit, as long as we only have a finite number of flavors, continuum reduction provides us with the exciting possibility to numerically solve large N QCD using chiral fermions and present day computers.",

      "summary": "We model the QCD Dirac operator as a power-law random banded matrix (RBM) with the appropriate chiral symmetry. Our motivation is the form of the Dirac operator in a basis of instantonic zero modes with a corresponding gauge background of instantons. We compare the spectral correlations of this model to those of an instanton liquid model (ILM) and find agreement well beyond the Thouless energy. In the bulk of the spectrum the (dimensionless) Thouless energy of the RBM scales with the square root of system size in agreement with the ILM and chiral perturbation theory. Near the origin the scaling of the (dimensionless) Thouless energy in the RBM remains the same as in the bulk which agrees with chiral perturbation theory but not with the ILM. Finally we discuss how this RBM should be modified in order to describe the spectral correlations of the QCD Dirac operator at the finite temperature chiral restoration transition.",

      "summary": "We study expectation values related to the dynamical lattice spacing that occurs in the recent supersymmetric 2d lattice Yang-Mills constructions of Cohen et al. [hep-lat/0307012]. For the purposes of this preliminary analysis, we restrict our attention to the bosonic part of that theory. That is, we compute observables in the fully quenched ensemble, equivalent to non-supersymmetric 2d lattice Yang-Mills with a dynamical lattice spacing and adjoint scalars. Our numerical simulations indicate difficulties with the proposed continuum limit. We find that expectation values tend to those of the undeformed ``daughter theory,'' in spite of the deformation suggested by Cohen et al. In an effort to understand these results, we examine the zero action configurations, with and without the deformation. Based on these considerations, we are able to interpret the simulation results in terms of entropic effects.",

For very small quark-antiquark separations R, the level orderings and approximate degeneracies disagree with the expectations from an effective string theory. As the quark-antiquark separation R increases, a dramatic rearrangement of the energies occurs, and above 2 fm, all of the levels studied show behavior consistent with an effective string description. The energy spacings are nearly pi/R, but a tantalizing fine structure remains. In addition to 4-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory, results from 3-dimensional SU(2) and compact U(1) gauge theories are also presented.",

We have computed the vector meson mass and the pseudoscalar decay constant for different values of beta at fixed value of r_0 m_PS. The results obtained in the quenched approximation are compared with data for pure Wilson and non-perturbatively O(a) improved Wilson computations. We show that our results from Wilson twisted mass QCD show clearly reduced lattice spacing errors, consistent with O(a) improvement and without the need of any improvement terms added. These results thus provide numerical evidence of the prediction in ref. [1].",

      "summary": "We describe a method to express the susceptibility and higher derivatives of the free energy in terms of the scaling variables (Wegner's nonlinear scaling fields) associated with the high-temperature (HT) fixed point of Dyson hierarchical model in arbitrary dimensions. We give a closed form solution of the linearized problem. We check that up to order 7 in the HT expansion, all the poles (\"small denominators\") that would naively appear in some positive dimension are canceled by zeroes (\"small numerators\"). The requirement of continuity in the dimension can be used to lift ambiguities which appear in calculations at fixed dimension. We show that the existence of a HT phase in the infinite volume limit for a continuous set of values of the dimension, requires that this mechanism works to all orders. On the other hand, most poles at negative values of the dimensional parameter (where the free energy density is not well-defined, but RG flows can be studied) persist and reflect the fact that for special negative values of the dimension, finite-size corrections become leading terms. We show that the inverse problem is also free of small denominator problems and that the initial values of the scaling variables can be expressed in terms of the infinite volume limit of the susceptibility and higher derivatives of the free energy. We discuss the existence of an infinite number of conserved quantities (RG invariants) and their relevance for the calculation of universal ratios of critical amplitudes.",

These models are discretized and {\\it twisted} versions of conventional supersymmetric sigma models with N=2 supersymmetry. The fermionic symmetry corresponds to a scalar BRST charge built from the original supercharges. The lattice theories possess local actions and in many cases admit a Wilson term to suppress doubles. In the two and four dimensional theorie s we show that these lattice theories are invariant under additional discrete symmetries. We argue that the presence of these exact symmetries ensures that no fine tuning is required to achieve N=2 supersymmetry in the continuum limit. As a concrete example we show preliminary numerical results from a simulation of the O(3) supersymmetric sigma model in two dimensions.",

      "summary": "We discuss how to extract renormalized from bare Polyakov loops in SU(N) lattice gauge theories at nonzero temperature in four spacetime dimensions. Single loops in an irreducible representation are multiplicatively renormalized without mixing, through a renormalization constant which depends upon both representation and temperature. The values of renormalized loops in the four lowest representations of SU(3) were measured numerically on small, coarse lattices. We find that in magnitude, condensates for the sextet and octet loops are approximately the square of the triplet loop. This agrees with a large $N$ expansion, where factorization implies that the expectation values of loops in adjoint and higher representations are just powers of fundamental and anti-fundamental loops. For three colors, numerically the corrections to the large $N$ relations are greatest for the sextet loop, $\\leq 25%$; these represent corrections of $\\sim 1/N$ for N=3. The values of the renormalized triplet loop can be described by an SU(3) matrix model, with an effective action dominated by the triplet loop. In several ways, the deconfining phase transition for N=3 appears to be like that in the $N=\\infty$ matrix model of Gross and Witten.",

      "summary": "We perform simulations of (3-colour) QCD with 2 quark flavours at a finite chemical potential $μ_I$ for isospin($I_3$), and of 2-colour QCD at a finite chemical potential $μ$ for quark number. At zero temperature, QCD at finite $μ_I$ has a mean-field phase transition at $μ_I=m_π$ to a superfluid state with a charged pion condensate which spontaneously breaks $I_3$. We study the finite temperature transition as a function of $μ_I$. For $μ_I < m_π$, where this is closely related to the transition at finite $μ$, this appears to be a crossover independent of quark mass, with no sign of the proposed critical endpoint. For $μ_I > m_π$ this becomes a true phase transition where the pion condensate evaporates. For $μ_I$ just above $m_π$ the transition seems to be second order, while for larger $μ_I$ it appears to become first order. At zero temperature, 2-colour QCD also possesses a superfluid state with a diquark condensate. We study its spectrum of Goldstone and pseudo-Goldstone bosons associated with chiral and quark-number symmetry breaking.",

The differentiability of the smearing scheme with respect to the link variables permits the use of modern Monte Carlo updating methods based on molecular dynamics evolution for gauge-field actions constructed using such smeared links. In examining the smeared mean plaquette and the static quark-antiquark potential, no degradation in effectiveness is observed as compared to link smearing methods currently in use, although an increased sensitivity to the smearing parameter is found.",

      "summary": "Capitalizing on recent advances in lattice QCD, we present a calculation of the leptonic decay constants f_{B_s} and f_{D_s} that includes effects of one strange sea quark and two light sea quarks. The discretization errors of improved staggered fermion actions are small enough to simulate with 3 dynamical flavors on lattices with spacings around 0.1 fm using present computer resources. By shedding the quenched approximation and the associated lattice scale ambiguity, lattice QCD greatly increases its predictive power. NRQCD is used to simulate heavy quarks with masses between 1.5 m_c and m_b. We arrive at the following results: f_{B_s} = 260 \\pm 7 \\pm 26 \\pm 8 \\pm 5 MeV and f_{D_s} = 290 \\pm 20 \\pm 29 \\pm 29 \\pm 6 MeV. The first quoted error is the statistical uncertainty, and the rest estimate the sizes of higher order terms neglected in this calculation. All of these uncertainties are systematically improvable by including another order in the weak coupling expansion, the nonrelativistic expansion, or the Symanzik improvement program.",

The study of hypernuclear physics has provided a significant amount of information regarding the structure and weak decays of light nuclei containing one or two Lambda's, and Sigma's. From a theoretical standpoint, little is known about the hyperon-nucleon interaction, which is required input for systematic calculations of hypernuclear structure. Furthermore, the long-standing discrepancies in the P-wave amplitudes for nonleptonic hyperon decays remain to be understood, and their resolution is central to a better understanding of the weak decays of hypernuclei. We present a framework that utilizes Luscher's finite-volume techniques in lattice QCD to extract the scattering length and effective range for Lambda-N scattering in both QCD and partially-quenched QCD. The effective theory describing the nonleptonic decays of hyperons using isospin symmetry alone, appropriate for lattice calculations, is constructed.",

The largest remaining $a^2$ scaling violations come from \"taste-changing\" interactions, which are significantly reduced over naive quarks because of carefully chosen smearing of the gauge links. Here we examine further improvements to the quark action and show that additional smearing of the links can reduce the taste-changing errors by another factor of two, whilst retaining a fully $a^2$-improved action. The taste-changing errors can be understood within a perturbative calculation of the four-quark operators that appear at one-loop. We also discuss unquenching techniques with such a highly improved action.",

Based on preliminary calculations with three flavors of dynamical quarks, the lattice estimate is $m_s = 75(15)$ MeV, a tantalizingly low value. On the other hand the leading estimates from scale and pseudo-scalar sum rules are $99(16)$ and $100(12)$ MeV respectively. The $τ$-decay sum rule estimates depend very sensitively on the value of $|V_{us}|$. The central values from different analyses lie in the range 115-120 MeV if unitarity of CKM matrix is imposed, and in the range 100-105 MeV if the Particle Data Group values for $|V_{us}|$ are used. I also give my reasons for why the lattice result is not yet in conflict with rigorous lower bounds from sum rule analyses.",

There are now results for three lattice spacings for a variety of light and strange quark masses, ranging down to $m_l=0.1 m_s$, where $m_s$ is the dynamical strange quark mass and $m_l$ is the common mass of the $u$ and $d$ quarks. Recently, the Fermilab, HPQCD, MILC and UKQCD collaborations have presented a summary of results obtained using these lattices. Compared with quenched results, these new calculations show great improvement in agreement with experiment. This talk addresses the technical improvements that make these calculations possible and provides additional details of calculations not presented in the initial summary. We demonstrate that a wide range of hadronic observables can now be calculated to 2--3% accuracy.",

These matrix elements are needed to predict the glueball branching ratios in $J/ψ$ radiative decays which will help to identify the glueball states in experiments. Two types of improved local gluonic operators are constructed for a self-consistent check, and the finite volume effects are also studied. The lattice spacing dependence of our results is very small and the continuum limits are reliably extrapolated.",

The new operator can be chosen to vanish in the unquenched sector of the partially quenched theory. Its contributions begin at next-to-leading order in the chiral expansion. At this order it contributes only to unphysical scattering processes, and we work out some examples. Its contributions to pseudo-Goldstone properties begin at next-to-next-to-leading order, and we determine their form. We also determine all the zero and two derivative operators in the $O(p^6)$ partially quenched chiral Lagrangian, finding three more than in unquenched QCD, and use these to give the general form of the analytic next-to-next-to-leading order contributions to the pseudo-Goldstone mass and decay constant. We discuss the general implications of such additional operators for the utility of partially quenched simulations",

      "summary": "In studies of the QCD deconfining phase transition or crossover by means of heavy ion experiments, one ought to be concerned about non-equilibrium effects due to heating and cooling of the system. Motivated by this, we look at hysteresis methods to study the dynamics of phase transitions. Our systems are temperature driven through the phase transition using updating procedures in the Glauber universality class. Hysteresis calculations are presented for a number of observables, including the (internal) energy, properties of Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters and structure functions. We test the methods for 2d Potts models, which provide a rich collection of phase transitions with a number of rigorously known properties. Comparing with equilibrium configurations we find a scenario where the dynamics of the transition leads to a spinodal decomposition which dominates the statistical properties of the configurations. One may expect an enhancement of low energy gluon production due to spinodal decomposition of the Polyakov loops, if such a scenario is realized by nature.",

This model includes $O(a^2)$ corrections to the continuum limit of staggered fermions and is related to the zero momentum limit of the Lee-Sharpe Lagrangian for staggered fermions. The naive construction based on a specific expansion in lattice spacing ($a$) of the Dirac matrix produces the term which gives the dominant contribution to the observed taste splitting in the pion masses. A more careful analysis can include extra terms which are also consistent with the symmetries of staggered fermions. Lastly I will mention possible uses of the model including studies of topology and fractional powers of the fermion determinant.",

      "summary": "A formulation of the fermion action is discussed which includes an explicit four momentum boost on the field prior to discretisation. This is used to shift the zero of lattice momentum to lie near one of the on-shell quark poles. The positive pole is selected if we wish to describe a valence quark, and negative pole for a valence anti-quark. Like NRQCD, the typical lattice momenta involved in hadronic correlation functions can be kept small: of order $O(a Λ_{\\rm QCD})$, rather than $O(a m_Q)$ even when describing heavy quarks. If we expand around the particle pole, the anti-particle correlator will be poorly described for large $a m_Q$. However, in that case the anti-particle will be far off shell and will only affect unphysical, renormalization factors. The formulation produces the correct continuum limit, and preliminary results have been obtained (for an unimproved action) of both the one-loop self energy and a non-perturbative correlation function.",

We show that the finite temperature chiral phase transition belongs to the O(2) universality class as expected. When we compute the finite size effects of the chiral susceptibility in the low temperature phase close to the transition, we find clear evidence for chiral singularities predicted by chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). On the other hand it is difficult to reconcile the quark mass dependence of various quantities near the chiral limit with ChPT.",

This produces converging (instead of asymptotic) perturbative series. We discuss the statistical errors and the lattice effects and show that accurate calculations are possible even in a crossover region where no approximation works. We show that the field cutoff is also a UV regulator. We point out the relevance for QCD questions discussed by Tomboulis and Trottier at this conference.",

In this preliminary study we focus on the effects of dynamical quark loops. Accordingly, we compare results of simulations with matched quenched and Asqtad dynamical gauge configurations. The latter include three flavors of light quarks. Our simulation uses clover Wilson valence quarks, treated in the Fermilab formalism. Preliminary results, as yet uncorrected by continuum matching factors, suggest a measurable enhancement in the form factor due to dynamical quark loops over the accessible range of $q^2$.",

At larger $μ_I$ we observe the phase transition from the superfluid pion-condensed phase to a quark-gluon plasma, noting its change from second order to first order as $μ_I$ is increased.

This propagator clearly shows positivity violation, indicating the absence of the transverse gluons from the physical spectrum, i.e. gluon confinement.

We find sizable negative norm contributions in the transverse gluon propagator indicating the absence of the transverse gluon from the physical spectrum. A simple analytic structure for the gluon propagator is proposed. For the quark propagator we find evidence for a mass-like singularity on the real timelike momentum axis, with a mass of 350 to 500 MeV.

      "summary": "We take advantage of the fact that in lambda phi ^4 problems a large field cutoff phi_max makes perturbative series converge toward values exponentially close to the exact values, to make optimal choices of phi_max. For perturbative series terminated at even order, it is in principle possible to adjust phi_max in order to obtain the exact result. For perturbative series terminated at odd order, the error can only be minimized. It is however possible to introduce a mass shift in order to obtain the exact result. We discuss weak and strong coupling methods to determine the unknown parameters. The numerical calculations in this article have been performed with a simple integral with one variable. We give arguments indicating that the qualitative features observed should extend to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. We found that optimization at even order is more efficient that at odd order. We compare our methods with the linear delta-expansion (LDE) (combined with the principle of minimal sensitivity) which provides an upper envelope of for the accuracy curves of various Pade and Pade-Borel approximants. Our optimization method performs better than the LDE at strong and intermediate coupling, but not at weak coupling where it appears less robust and subject to further improvements. We also show that it is possible to fix the arbitrary parameter appearing in the LDE using the strong coupling expansion, in order to get accuracies comparable to ours.",

Moreover, the underlying chiral symmetry leads to the suppression of ultraviolet noise in the associated topological charge densities (\"chiral smoothing\"). This provides a solid foundation for the direct study of the role of topological charge fluctuations in the physics of QCD vacuum. Using these tools it was recently demonstrated that: (a) there is a well-defined space-time structure (order) in topological charge density (defined through overlap fermions) for typical configurations contributing to QCD path integral; (b) this fundamental structure is low-dimensional, exhibiting sign-coherent behavior on subsets of dimension less than four and not less than one; (c) the structure has a long-range global character (spreading over maximal space-time distances) and is built around the locally one-dimensional network of strong fields (skeleton). In this talk we elaborate on certain aspects and implications of these results.",

      "summary": "Chiral perturbation theory predicts that in quantum chromodymamics light dynamical quarks suppress the topological (instanton) susceptibility. We investigate this suppression through direct numerical simulation using the Asqtad improved lattice fermion action. This action holds promise for carrying out nonperturbative simulations over a range of quark masses for which chiral perturbation theory is expected to converge. To test the effectiveness of the action in capturing instanton physics, we measure the topological susceptibility as a function of quark masses with 2+1 dynamical flavors. Our results, when extrapolated to zero lattice spacing, are consistent with predictions of leading order chiral perturbation theory.\n  Included in our study is a comparison of three methods for analyzing the topological susceptibility: (1) the Boulder hypercubic blocking technique with the Boulder topological charge operator, (2) the more traditional Wilson cooling method with the twisted plaquette topological charge operator and (3) the improved cooling method of de Forcrand, Perez, and Stamatescu and their improved topological charge operator.",

We point out a complication of this approach and show how it can be resolved. Partial quenching changes the chiral symmetry group and introduces a new independent four-derivative operator. We explore the effects of this new operator. We describe tree-level scattering processes to which it contributes, and show how they can be used, in principle, to deterimine its unknown coefficient. We also calculate its lowest-order (one-loop) contribution to charged meson masses and decay constants. In addition, we present the form of the analytic next-to-next-to-leading order meson mass and decay constant corrections, which are needed for lattice fits.",

The example vortex world-surface contains one lone self-intersection point, which contributes a quantum 1/2 to the topological charge. On the other hand, the surface in question is orientable and thus must carry global topological charge zero due to general arguments. Therefore, there must be another contribution, coming from vortex writhe. The latter is known for the lattice analogue of the example vortex considered, where it is quite intuitive. For the vortex in the continuum, including the limit of an infinitely thin vortex, a careful analysis is performed and it is shown how the contribution to the topological charge induced by writhe is distributed over the vortex surface.",

For two values of lattice spacing, $β=5.7$ ($a \\approx .18$ fm) and 5.9 ($a \\approx .12$ fm), we probe the light quark mass region using clover improved Wilson fermions with the MQA pole-shifting ansatz to treat the exceptional configuration problem. The quenched chiral loop parameters $m_0$ and $α_Φ$ are determined from a study of the pseudoscalar hairpin correlator. From a global fit to the meson correlators, estimates are obtained for the relevant chiral Lagrangian parameters, including the Leutwyler parameters $L_5$ and $L_8$. Using the parameters obtained from the singlet and nonsinglet pseudoscalar correlators, the quenched chiral loop effect in the nonsinglet scalar meson correlator is studied. By removing this QCL effect from the lattice correlator, we obtain the mass and decay constant of the ground state scalar, isovector meson $a_0$.",

Masses, magnetic moments, the matrix elements of isovector twist-2 operators and axial-vector currents are examined at the one-loop level in a double expansion in the light-quark masses and the lattice spacing. This work will be useful in extrapolating the results of simulations using Wilson valence and sea quarks, as well as simulations using Wilson sea quarks and Ginsparg-Wilson valence quarks, to the continuum.",

      "summary": "We show that it is possible to construct $ε^\\prime/ε$ to NLO using partially quenched chiral perturbation theory (PQChPT) from amplitudes that are computable on the lattice. We demonstrate that none of the needed amplitudes require three-momentum on the lattice for either the full theory or the partially quenched theory; non-degenerate quark masses suffice. Furthermore, we find that the electro-weak penguin ($ΔI=3/2$ and 1/2) contributions to $ε^\\prime/ε$ in PQChPT can be determined to NLO using only degenerate ($m_K=m_π$) $K\\toπ$ computations without momentum insertion. Issues pertaining to power divergent contributions, originating from mixing with lower dimensional operators, are addressed. Direct calculations of $K\\toππ$ at unphysical kinematics are plagued with enhanced finite volume effects in the (partially) quenched theory, but in simulations when the sea quark mass is equal to the up and down quark mass the enhanced finite volume effects vanish to NLO in PQChPT. In embedding the QCD penguin left-right operator onto PQChPT an ambiguity arises, as first emphasized by Golterman and Pallante. With one version (the \"PQS\") of the QCD penguin, the inputs needed from the lattice for constructing $K\\toππ$ at NLO in PQChPT coincide with those needed for the full theory. Explicit expressions for the finite logarithms emerging from our NLO analysis to the above amplitudes are also given.",

A new cluster algorithm allows us to compute monomer-monomer and dimer-dimer correlations at zero monomer density (chiral limit) accurately on large lattices. This makes it possible to show convincingly, for the first time, that these models undergo a finite temperature phase transition which belongs to the Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class. We find that this universality class is unaffected even in the large N limit. This shows that the mean field analysis often used in this limit breaks down in the critical region.",

We argue that for T < Tc the equation of state derived from Monte--Carlo simulations of two flavour QCD at non-zero chemical potential can be well described by a hadron resonance gas when using the same set of approximations as used in current lattice calculations. We estimate the importance of truncation errors arising from the use of a Taylor expansion in terms of the quark chemical potential and examine the influence of unphysically large quark masses on the equation of state and the critical conditions for deconfinement.",

Both results at the physical pion mass agree with the experimental values of the Roper resonance ($N^{1/2+}(1440)$) and $S_{11}$ ($N^{1/2-}(1535)$). This is seen for the first time in a lattice QCD calculation. These results are obtained on a quenched Iwasaki $16^3 \\times 28$ lattice with $a = 0.2 {\\rm fm}$. We also extract the ghost $η' N$ states (a quenched artifact) which are shown to decouple from the nucleon interpolation field above $m_π \\sim 300 {\\rm MeV}$. From the quark mass dependence of these states in the chiral region, we conclude that spontaneously broken chiral symmetry dictates the dynamics of light quarks in the nucleon.",

We calculate only current-current diagrams, so that our results apply for operators whose flavor structure does not allow ``eye-diagrams''. We present general formulae, based on two independent approaches, and give numerical results for the cases in which the operators have the taste (staggered flavor) of the pseudo-Goldstone pion.

The most notable example is lattice Landau gauge, where the effective gluon mass is observed to rise rather than fall with increasing distance. We trace this violation to the use of quenched auxiliary fields in the lattice gauge fixing process, and show that violation of spectral positivity is a general feature of quenching. We illustrate this with a simple quenched mass-mixing model in continuum field theory, and with a quenched form of the Ising model. For lattice gauge fixing associated with Abelian projection and lattice Landau gauge, we show that spectral positivity is violated by processes similar to those found in quenched QCD. For covariant gauges parametrized by a gauge-fixing parameter $α$, the SU(2) gluon propagator is well described by a simple quenched mass-mixing formula. The gluon mass parameter appears to be independent of $α$ for sufficiently large $α$.",

      "summary": "We present a quenched lattice calculation of the nucleon isovector vector and axial-vector charges gV and gA. The chiral symmetry of domain wall fermions makes the calculation of the nucleon axial charge particularly easy since the Ward-Takahashi identity requires the vector and axial-vector currents to have the same renormalization, up to lattice spacing errors of order O(a^2). The DBW2 gauge action provides enhancement of the good chiral symmetry properties of domain wall fermions at larger lattice spacing than the conventional Wilson gauge action. Taking advantage of these methods and performing a high statistics simulation, we find a significant finite volume effect between the nucleon axial charges calculated on lattices with (1.2 fm)^3 and (2.4 fm)^3 volumes (with lattice spacing, a, of about 0.15 fm). On the large volume we find gA = 1.212 +/- 0.027(statistical error) +/- 0.024(normalization error). The quoted systematic error is the dominant (known) one, corresponding to current renormalization. We discuss other possible remaining sources of error. This theoretical first principles calculation, which does not yet include isospin breaking effects, yields a value of gA only a little bit below the experimental one, 1.2670 +/- 0.0030.",

      "summary": "We use the non-relativistic expansion of QCD (NRQCD) on the lattice to study the lowest hybrid configuration contribution to the ground state of heavy S-wave mesons. Using lowest-order lattice NRQCD to create the heavy-quark propagators, we form a basis of ``unperturbed'' S-wave and hybrid states. We then apply the lowest-order coupling of the quark spin and chromomagnetic field at an intermediate time slice to create ``mixed'' correlators between the S-wave and hybrid states. From the resulting amplitudes, we extract the off-diagonal element of our two-state Hamiltonian. Diagonalizing this Hamiltonian gives us the admixture of hybrid configuration within the meson ground state. The present effort represents a continuation of previous work: the analysis has been extended to include lattices of varying spacings, source operators having better overlap with the ground states, and the pseudoscalar (along with the vector) channel. Results are presented for bottomonium ($Υ$, $η_b^{}$) using three different sets of quenched lattices. We also show results for charmonium ($J/ψ$, $η_c^{}$) from one lattice set, although we note that the non-relativistic approximation is not expected to be very good in this case.",

First we present evidence that the system undergoes a transition to a state with a diquark condensate, which spontaneously breaks quark number at $μ=m_π/2$, and that this transition is mean field in nature. We then examine the 3 states that would be Goldstone bosons at $μ=0$ for zero Dirac and Majorana quark masses. The predictions of chiral effective Lagrangians give a good description of the behaviour of these masses for $μ< m_π/2$. Except for the heaviest of these states, these predictions diverge from our measurements, once $μ$ is significantly greater than $m_π/2$. However, the qualitative behaviour of these masses, indicates that the physics is very similar to that predicted by these effective Lagrangians, and there is some indication that at least part of these discrepancies is due to saturation, a lattice artifact.",

The lattice model we employ was analyzed by Golterman and Petcher in \\cite{susy} where a perturbative proof was given that the continuum supersymmetric Ward identities are recovered without finite tuning in the limit of vanishing lattice spacing. Our simulations demonstrate the existence of important non-perturbative effects in finite volumes which modify these conclusions. It appears that in certain regions of parameter space the vacuum state can contain solitons corresponding to field configurations which interpolate between different classical vacua. In the background of these solitons supersymmetry is partially broken and a light fermion mode is observed. At fixed coupling the critical mass separating phases of broken and unbroken supersymmetry appears to be volume dependent. We discuss the implications of our results for continuum supersymmetry breaking.",

Hence, we present a novel approach that exploits the full information content from a given lattice configuration by measuring an overdetermined set of lattice observables to provide maximal statistical constraints on the generalized form factors at a given virtuality, t. In an exploratory investigation using unquenched QCD configurations at intermediate sea quark masses, we demonstrate that our new technique is superior to conventional methods and leads to reliable numerical signals for the n=2 flavor singlet generalized form factors up to 3 GeV^2. The contribution from connected diagrams in the flavor singlet sector to the total quark angular momentum is measured to an accuracy of the order of one percent.",

We analyzed the short and the long distance behavior, making comparisons with the zero temperature case. The temperature dependence of the electric screening mass is carefully investigated.

      "summary": "The quenched chiral logs are examined on a $16^3 \\times 28$ lattice with Iwasaki gauge action and overlap fermions. The pion decay constant $f_π$ is used to set the lattice spacing, $a = 0.200(3) {\\rm fm}$. With pion mass as low as $\\sim 180 {\\rm MeV}$, we see the quenched chiral logs clearly in $m_π^2/m$ and $f_P$, the pseudoscalar decay constant. We analyze the data to determine how low the pion mass needs to be in order for the quenched one-loop chiral perturbation theory ($χ$PT) to apply. With the constrained curve-fitting method, we are able to extract the quenched chiral log parameter $δ$ together with other low-energy parameters. Only for $m_π \\leq 300 {\\rm MeV}$ do we obtain a consistent and stable fit with a constant $δ$ which we determine to be 0.24(3)(4) (at the chiral scale $Λ_χ=0.8 {\\rm GeV}$). By comparing to the $12^3 \\times 28$ lattice, we estimate the finite volume effect to be about 2.7% for the smallest pion mass. We also fitted the pion mass to the form for the re-summed cactus diagrams and found that its applicable region is extended farther than the range for the one-loop formula, perhaps up to $m_π \\sim 500-600$ MeV. The scale independent $δ$ is determined to be 0.20(3) in this case. We study the quenched non-analytic terms in the nucleon mass and find that the coefficient $C_{1/2}$ in the nucleon mass is consistent with the prediction of one-loop $χ$PT\\@. We also obtain the low energy constant $L_5$ from $f_π$. We conclude from this study that it is imperative to cover only the range of data with the pion mass less than $\\sim 300 {\\rm MeV}$ in order to examine the chiral behavior of the hadron masses and decay constants in quenched QCD and match them with quenched one-loop $χ$PT\\@.",

We argue that for T < T_c the equation of state derived from Monte--Carlo simulations of (2+1) quark--flavor QCD can be well described by a hadron resonance gas. We examine the quark mass dependence of the hadron spectrum on the lattice and discuss its description in terms of the MIT bag model. This is used to formulate a resonance gas model for arbitrary quark masses which can be compared to lattice calculations. We finally apply this model to analyze the quark mass dependence of the critical temperature obtained in lattice calculations. We show that the value of T_c for different quark masses agrees with lines of constant energy density in a hadron resonance gas. For large quark masses a corresponding contribution from a glueball resonance gas is required.",

The algorithm uses the constrained monomer-dimer representation of the theory and should also be of interest to researchers working on other models with similar constraints. Using the new algorithm we address questions related to the chiral limit of strongly coupled U(N) gauge theories beyond the mean field approximation. We show that the infinite volume chiral condensate is non-zero in three and four dimensions. However, on a square lattice of size $L$ we find $\\sum_x < \\barψψ(x) \\barψψ(0) > \\sim L^{2-η}$ for large $L$ where $η= 0.420(3)/N + 0.078(4)/N^2$.

      "summary": "While sign-coherent 4-dimensional structures cannot dominate topological charge fluctuations in the QCD vacuum at all scales due to reflection positivity, it is possible that enhanced coherence exists over extended space-time regions of lower dimension. Using the overlap Dirac operator to calculate topological charge density, we present evidence for such structure in pure-glue SU(3) lattice gauge theory. It is found that a typical equilibrium configuration is dominated by two oppositely-charged sign-coherent connected structures (``sheets'') covering about 80% of space-time. Each sheet is built from elementary 3-d cubes connected through 2-d faces, and approximates a low-dimensional curved manifold (or possibly a fractal structure) embedded in the 4-d space. At the heart of the sheet is a ``skeleton'' formed by about 18% of the most intense space-time points organized into a global long-range structure, involving connected parts spreading over maximal possible distances. We find that the skeleton is locally 1-dimensional and propose that its geometrical properties might be relevant for understanding the possible role of topological charge fluctuations in the physics of chiral symmetry breaking.",

      "summary": "Theoretical predictions for the magnetic moments of the physical Delta baryons are extracted from lattice QCD calculations. We utilize finite-range regulated effective field theory that is constructed to have the correct Dirac moment mass dependence in the region where the up and down quark masses are heavy. Of particular interest is the chiral nonanalytic behaviour encountered as the nucleon-pion decay channel opens. We find a Delta^++ magnetic moment (at the Delta pole) of 4.99 \\pm 0.56 μ_N. This result is within the Particle Data Group range of 3.7-7.5 μ_N and compares well with the experimental result of Bosshard et al. of 4.52 \\pm 0.51 \\pm 0.45 μ_N. The interplay between the different pion-loop contributions to the Delta^+ magnetic moment leads to the surprising result that the proton moment may exceed that of the Delta^+, contrary to conventional expectations.",

In this work, we show that although the restriction to a fixed topological sector becomes irrelevant in the infinite volume limit, it gives rise to characteristic finite size effects due to contributions from all $θ$-vacua. We calculate these effects and show how to extract physical results from numerical data obtained at fixed topology.",

      "title": "Lattice Supersymmetry and Topological Field Theory",
      "summary": "It is known that certain theories with extended supersymmetry can be discretized in such a way as to preserve an exact fermionic symmetry. In the simplest model of this kind, we show that this residual supersymmetric invariance is actually a BRST symmetry associated with gauge fixing an underlying local shift symmetry. Furthermore, the starting lattice action is then seen to be entirely a gauge fixing term. The corresponding continuum theory is known to be a topological field theory. We look, in detail, at one example - supersymmetric quantum mechanics which possesses two such BRST symmetries. In this case, we show that the lattice theory can be obtained by blocking out of the continuum in a carefully chosen background metric. Such a procedure will not change the Ward identities corresponding to the BRST symmetries since they correspond to topological observables. Thus, at the quantum level, the continuum BRST symmetry is preserved in the lattice theory. Similar conclusions are reached for the two-dimensional complex Wess-Zumino model and imply that all the supersymmetric Ward identities are satisfied {\\it exactly} on the lattice. Numerical results supporting these conclusions are presented.",

Results from both quenched and dynamical quark simulations are presented. We also compare with earlier results using Wilson quarks at heavier quark masses. The results on lattices with three flavors of dynamical quarks show effects of sea quarks on the hybrid propagators which probably result from coupling to two meson states. We extrapolate the quenched results to the physical light quark mass to allow comparison with experimental candidates for the $1^{-+}$ hybrid meson. The lattice result remains somewhat heavier than the experimental result, although it may be consistent with the $π_1(1600)$.",

In a deconstructed four-dimensional theory with N=2 supersymmetry, we show that the chiral symmetries only appear in the infrared and that the anomaly is reproduced in the usual framework of lattice perturbation theory with Wilson fermions. We then realize the theory on the world-volume of fractional D-branes on an orbifold. In this brane realization, we show how deconstructed theory anomalies can be computed via classical supergravity. Our methods and observations are more generally applicable to deconstructed/latticized supersymmetric theories in various dimensions.",
