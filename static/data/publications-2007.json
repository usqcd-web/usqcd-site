      "summary": "QCD at a finite quark-number chemical potential $μ$ has a complex fermion determinant, which precludes its study by standard lattice QCD simulations. We therefore simulate lattice QCD at finite $μ$ in the phase-quenched approximation, replacing the fermion determinant with its magnitude. These simulations are used to study the finite temperature transition for small $μ$,where the position and nature of this transition are expected to be unchanged by this approximation. We look for the expected critical endpoint for 3-flavour QCD. Here, it had been argued that the critical point at zero $μ$ would become the critical endpoint at small $μ$, for quark masses just above the critical mass. Our simulations indicate that this does not happen, and there is no such critical endpoint for small $μ$. We discuss how we might adapt techniques used for imaginary $μ$ to improve the signal/noise ratio and strengthen our conclusions, using results from relatively low statistics studies.",

      "title": "Effective field theories for QCD with rooted staggered fermions",
      "summary": "Even highly improved variants of lattice QCD with staggered fermions show significant violations of taste symmetry at currently accessible lattice spacings. In addition, the \"rooting trick\" is used in order to simulate with the correct number of light sea quarks, and this makes the lattice theory nonlocal, even though there is good reason to believe that the continuum limit is in the correct universality class. In order to understand scaling violations, it is thus necessary to extend the construction of the Symanzik effective theory to include rooted staggered fermions. We show how this can be done, starting from a generalization of the renormalization-group approach to rooted staggered fermions recently developed by one of us. We then explain how the chiral effective theory follows from the Symanzik action, and show that it leads to \"rooted\" staggered chiral perturbation theory as the correct chiral theory for QCD with rooted staggered fermions. We thus establish a direct link between the renormalization-group based arguments for the correctness of the continuum limit and the success of rooted staggered chiral perturbation theory in fitting numerical results obtained with the rooting trick. In order to develop our argument, we need to assume the existence of a standard partially-quenched chiral effective theory for any local partially-quenched theory. Other technical, but standard, assumptions are also required.",

We show that the order of magnitude of these effects can be estimated from data at relatively small volume. Using this estimate, we propose to use linear fits in increasingly small temperature regions as the volume is increased (rather than using a fixed temperature interval). The choice of the exact coefficient of proportionality can be optimized and reveals interesting crossing patterns among estimates. We show that the new procedure works very well for Dyson's hierarchical model. We discuss applications of the method for 3 dimensional spin models and finite temperature lattice gauge theories and comment on the nonlinear effects for existing calculations.",

Features of the currents associated with these symmetries are discussed, including the fact that some different, non-commuting symmetry generators lead to the same Noether current.

      "summary": "We study the role of diquarks in light baryons through point to point baryon correlators. We contrast results from quenched simulations with ones with two flavors of dynamical overlap fermions. The scalar, pseudoscalar and axial vector diquarks are combined with light quarks to form color singlets. The quenched simulation shows large zero mode effects in correlators containing the scalar and pseudoscalar diquark. The two scalar diquarks created by gamma_5 and gamma_0gamma_5 lead to different behavior in baryon correlators, showing that the interaction of diquarks with the third light quark matters: we do not see an isolated diquark. In our quark mass range, the scalar diquark created by gamma_5 seems to play a greater role than the others.",

When the two short directions have equal length and identical boundary conditions, there is a single transition. When the two short directions have boundary conditions of opposite parity and are of roughly equal extent, the C-breaking and deconfinement transitions separate. When the two short dimensions are of different length, the transitions are modified in qualitative agreement with expectations from dimensional reduction.

A previous study has shown that such simulations are feasible, at least on small lattices. In the current study, we investigate some of the issues left open: we study the errors introduced by our approximation of the action and we show how to tune it to reduce the cost of the simulations while keeping the errors under control. To further reduce the cost of the simulations, we check the reliability of reweighting method with respect to the baryon number. Finally, using these optimizations, we carry out the simulations at larger densities than in our previous study to look for signals of a phase transition.",

The algorithm we used in our earlier work employs an exact calculation of the fermionic determinant which limits the size of the lattices we can simulate. Interesting questions can only be answered if we simulate at larger volume. In this paper we explore an algorithm, Hybrid Noisy Monte Carlo, that employs a determinant estimator rather than an exact calculation. We first present the technical aspects of the estimator, check that the algorithm is correct by comparing it with our previous study, and then discuss its merits. We will also discuss the challenges faced when simulating larger lattice volumes.",

The 2-loop expression for Z_g can be directly related to the 3-loop bare beta-function beta_L(g_0).\n  Our calculation is performed using overlap fermions and Wilson gluons, and the background field technique has been chosen for convenience. Our results depend explicitly on the number of fermion flavors (N_f) and colors (N). Since the dependence of Z_g on the overlap parameter rho cannot be extracted analytically, we tabulate our results for different values of rho in the allowed range (0<rho<2), focusing on values which are being used most frequently in simulations. Plots of the 1- and 2-loop results for Z_g versus rho exhibit a nontrivial dependence on the overlap parameter.\n  A longer write-up of this work may be found in 0709.4368.",

      "summary": "Many results from lattice QCD of broad importance to particle and nuclear physics are obtained with 2+1 flavors of staggered sea quarks. In the continuum limit, staggered fermions yield four species, called tastes. To reduce the number of tastes to one (per flavor), the simulation employs the fourth root of the four-taste staggered fermion determinant. This talk surveys evidence in favor of this procedure, refutes recent criticisms, and reviews recent algorithmic and technical improvements. Physics results are covered in other plenary talks.",

      "summary": "We discuss the properties of 't Hooft vertices in partially quenched and rooted versions of QCD in the continuum. These theories have a physical subspace, equivalent to ordinary QCD, that is contained within a larger space that includes many unphysical correlation functions. We find that the 't Hooft vertices in the physical subspace have the expected form, despite the presence of unphysical 't Hooft vertices appearing in correlation functions that have an excess of valence quarks (or ghost quarks). We resolve an apparent paradox that arises when one uses rooted staggered fermions to study one-flavor QCD, by showing how, in partially quenched theories, it is possible to have spontaneous symmetry breaking of a non-anomalous symmetry in finite volume. Using these results, we demonstrate that arguments recently given by Creutz--claiming to disprove the validity of rooted staggered QCD--are incorrect. In particular, the unphysical 't Hooft vertices do not present an obstacle to the recovery of taste symmetry in the continuum limit.",

We also review results for the neutral kaon mixing amplitude $B_K$, the Kl3 form factor, pseudoscalar meson structure, and vector meson decay constants. In the baryon sector we review results for the spectrum, and nucleon form factors and structure functions. Highlights of our programme include preliminary quark masses, and determinations of $V_{us}$ from both $f_K/f_π$ and from Kl3, and an updated result for $B_K$. We find significant finite volume effects in the nucleon axial charge $g_A$ for our $m_π=330$ MeV ensemble on a $(2.7 {\\rm fm})^3$ lattice, and highlight the importance of large physical volumes for non-trivial nucleon physics.",

We discuss their effects on the asymptotic behavior of the perturbative series for the average plaquette. We present new methods to infer the existence of these zeros in region of the complex beta plane where MC reweighting is not reliable. These methods are based on the assumption that the plaquette distribution can be approximated by a phi^4 type distribution. We give new estimates of the locations for a 4^4 lattice. For SU(2), we found zeros at beta =2.18(1) \\pm i0.18(2) (which differs from previous estimates), and at beta =2.18(1) \\pm i0.22(2). For SU(3), we confirm beta =5.54(2)\\pm i0.10(2) and found additional zeros at beta =5.54(2)\\pm i0.16(2). Some of the technical material can be found in recent preprints, in the following we emphasize the motivations (why it is important to know the locations of the zeros) and the challenges (why it is difficult to locate the zeros when the volume increases)",

We employ non-local operators, consisting of spatially separated quark creation and annihilation operators connected by a straight Wilson line.

As an example, we demonstrate that we can obtain the first x-moment of the transverse momentum dependent parton distribution function f_1^{n=1}(k_T) from our data. Our results, which are not renormalized, show a Gaussian-like distribution. The root mean squared transverse momentum is about 560 MeV for a Gaussian fit, close to phenomenological values.",

As a specific example, we consider finite volume nucleon current correlators, and focus on the nucleon magnetic moment. Because the multipole decomposition relies on SO(3) rotational invariance, the structure of such finite volume corrections is unrelated to infinite volume multipole form factors. One can deduce volume corrections to the magnetic moment only when a zero-mode photon coupling vanishes, as occurs at next-to-leading order in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. To deduce such finite volume corrections, however, one must assume continuous momentum transfer. In practice, volume corrections with momentum transfer dependence are required to address the extraction of the magnetic moment, or other observables that arise in momentum dependent correlation functions. Additionally we shed some light on a puzzle concerning differences in lattice form factor data at equal values of momentum transfer squared.",

It was demonstrated earlier that a large basis of extended baryon operators on anisotropic, quenched lattices can be used to reliably extract the masses of 5 or more excited states in the nucleon channel. All-to-all quark propagators are expected to be needed when studying these excited states on light, dynamical configurations because contributions from multi-particle states are expected to be significant. The dilution method is used to approximate the all-to-all quark propagators. Low-lying eigenmodes can also be used if necessary. For efficient computation of matrix elements of the interpolating operators, the algorithms should exploit the fact that many extended baryon operators can be obtained from the different linear combinations of three-quark colour-singlet operators. The sparseness of the diluted noise vectors also afford several computation simplifications. Some preliminary results are presented for nucleon effective masses.",

We demonstrate in Higgs-Yukawa models that Higgs mass lower bounds and upper bounds can be determined in lattice simulations when triviality requires the necessity of a finite cutoff to maintain non-zero interactions. The vacuum instability problem is investigated and the lattice approach is compared with the traditional renormalization group procedure which sets similar goals to correlate lower and upper Higgs mass bounds with the scale of new physics. A novel feature of our lattice simulations is the use of Ginsparg-Wilson fermions to represent the effects of Top quark loops in Higgs dynamics. The need for chiral lattice fermions is discussed and the approach is extended to full Top-Higgs-QCD dynamics. We also report results from our large $N_F$ analysis of Top-Higgs Yukawa models to gain analytic insight and to verify our new lattice tool set which is deployed in the simulations. The role of non-perturbative lattice studies to investigate heavy Higgs particle scenarios is illustrated in extensions of the Standard Model.",

The bare quark mass dependence of the quark spectral function is analyzed by varying the hopping parameter κin Landau gauge. We assume a two-pole structure for the quark spectral function, which is numerically found to work quite well for any value of κ. It is shown that in the chiral limit the quark spectral function has two collective modes that correspond to the normal and plasmino excitations, while it is dominated by a single-pole structure when the bare quark mass becomes large.",

From the form factors we are able to obtain estimates of the magnetic moment and the charge radius of the Delta, which we compare to existing experimental and theoretical results.Our non-zero result for the electric quadrupole form factor signals a deformation of the Delta, pointing to an oblate charge distribution.",

      "summary": "The large systems of complex linear equations that are generated in QCD problems often have multiple right-hand sides (for multiple sources) and multiple shifts (for multiple masses). Deflated GMRES methods have previously been developed for solving multiple right-hand sides. Eigenvectors are generated during solution of the first right-hand side and used to speed up convergence for the other right-hand sides. Here we discuss deflating non-restarted methods such as BiCGStab. For effective deflation, both left and right eigenvectors are needed. Fortunately, with the Wilson matrix, left eigenvectors can be derived from the right eigenvectors. We demonstrate for difficult problems with kappa near kappa_c that deflating eigenvalues can significantly improve BiCGStab. We also will look at improving solution of twisted mass problems with multiple shifts. Projecting over previous solutions is an easy way to reduce the work needed.",

      "summary": "We present a status report on a new high statistics study of the high temperature transition in full QCD at zero chemical potential. Our simulations use both improved asqtad and p4 staggered quarks on lattices with a temporal extent N_t = 8 and light quark masses approximately one tenth the strange quark mass. In this report we describe the setup of our calculations and present a preliminary analysis of a variety of sources of systematic error and ambiguity in the determination of the crossover temperature. We propose to present our final analysis with double the current statistics. These calculations were carried out on the IBM BlueGene/L supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",

Both the size of the residual quark mass, which measures the amount of chiral symmetry breaking, and of the mixed meson splitting Delta_mix, a measure of taste-symmetry breaking, show that discretization effects are under control in our mixed action lattice simulations. We show preliminary data for pseudoscalar meson masses, decay constants and B_K. We discuss general issues associated with the chiral extrapolation of lattice data, and, as an example, present a preliminary chiral and continuum extrapolation of f_pi. The quality of our data shows that the good chiral properties of domain-wall quarks, in combination with the light sea quark masses and multiple lattice spacings available with the MILC staggered configurations, will allow for a precise determination of B_K.",

We use the relativistic heavy quark action with 3 parameters non-perturbatively determined by matching to experimental quantities. Chiral extrapolation is done on four light sea quark masses from 0.005 to 0.03, with $m_s=0.04$ and $m_{res}=0.003$. We can either predict meson masses assuming the lattice spacing is known from other methods, or calculate the lattice spacing using those quantities.",

We analyze this according to the prediction from chiral perturbation theory determined by Prelovsek, which indicates that the leading unitarity violations come from taste breaking effects. We show that our data behaves in the way predicted by Prelovsek, thus verifying that the largest contribution to the violations of unitarity which arise at finite lattice spacing can be described by the mixed-action chiral perturbation theory.",

The lightest dynamical meson mass in our set-up is around 331 MeV, while partially quenched mesons reach masses as low as 250 MeV. The applicability of SU(3)xSU(3) and SU(2)xSU(2) (partially quenched) chiral perturbation theory will be compared and we quote values for the low-energy constants from both approaches. We will extract the average light quark and strange quark masses and use a non-perturbative renormalization technique (RI/MOM) to quote their physical values. The pion and kaon decay constants are determined at those values from our chiral fits and their ratio is used to obtain the CKM-matrix element |V_us|. The results presented here include statistical errors only.",

For a free particle in one space, one time, and one flavor dimension, the eigenmodes of the one-body operator appearing in the transfer matrix are calculated, and the role of the negative eigenmodes arising when M > 1 is studied. In the case of three space dimensions, oscillatory behavior for hadron correlation functions in QCD is shown to emerge for free fermions when M exceeds 1, and to increase with increasing M. Analogous behavior is observed for domain wall fermions on HYP smeared MILC lattices, and a procedure is demonstrated for subtracting oscillating terms from physical observables.",

Calculations with improved staggered fermions have been performed on lattices with temporal extent Nt =4 and 6 on a line of constant physics with almost physical quark mass values; the pion mass is about 220 MeV, and the strange quark mass is adjusted to its physical value. High statistics results on large lattices are obtained for bulk thermodynamic observables, i.e. pressure, energy and entropy density, at vanishing quark chemical potential for a wide range of temperatures, 140 MeV < T < 800 MeV. We present a detailed discussion of finite cut-off effects which become particularly significant for temperatures larger than about twice the transition temperature. At these high temperatures we also performed calculations of the trace anomaly on lattices with temporal extent Nt=8. Furthermore, we have performed an extensive analysis of zero temperature observables including the light and strange quark condensates and the static quark potential at zero temperature. These are used to set the temperature scale for thermodynamic observables and to calculate renormalized observables that are sensitive to deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration and become order parameters in the infinite and zero quark mass limits, respectively.",

      "summary": "We extend our previous study of taste-symmetry breaking using HYP-smeared staggered fermions in two ways. First, we improve the statistics of a comparison of unimproved and HYP-smeared staggered fermions on quenched lattices with $a\\approx 0.1 $fm. This allows us to obtain a signal for all pion tastes, rather than just a subset, and thus to make a complete comparison. In addition, it allows us to differentiate between wall and local sources. Second, we compare HYP-smeared valence quarks to asqtad valence quarks on 2+1 flavor unquenched MILC lattices. We find that taste breaking is substantially reduced by HYP-smearing, bringing the size of this discretization effect (which is the dominant such effect with staggered fermions) down to the size expected generically for any fermion type.",

We find that $ξ_R/ξ_0$ is relatively close to 1 in our parameter search, which allows us to fix $ξ_0$ in our runs. We proposed to determine the gauge and fermion anisotropy in a Schrödinger-background small box using Wilson loop ratios and PCAC masses. We demonstrate that these ideas are equivalent to but more efficient than the conventional meson dispersion approach. The spatial and temporal clover coefficients are fixed to the tree-level tadpole-improved clover values, and we demonstrate that they satisfy the nonperturbative condition determined by Schrödinger functional method.",

      "summary": "We calculate the relation between the bare coupling constant g_0 and the MSbar-renormalized coupling g_MS: g_0 = Z_g(g_0,a μ) g_MS, to 2 loops in perturbation theory. We employ the standard Wilson action for gluons and the overlap action for fermions. For convenience, we have worked with the background field technique, which only requires evaluation of 2-point Green's function for the problem at hand. Our results depend explicitly on the number of fermion flavors (N_f) and colors (N). Since the dependence of Z_g on the overlap parameter rho cannot be extracted analytically, we tabulate our results for different values in the allowed range of rho (0 < rho < 2), focusing on values which are being used most frequently in simulations. Knowledge of Z_g allows us to derive the 3-loop coefficient of the bare beta-function (beta_L(g_0)) which, unlike the 1- and 2-loop coefficients, is regularization-dependent. The nontrivial dependence of Z_g and of beta_L(g_0) on rho is plotted for various choices of N, N_f.",

Chiral extrapolation formulae are derived for partially quenched QCD, and quenched QCD simulations. On a torus, volume dependence of electromagnetic observables is complicated by SO(4) breaking, as well as photon zero-mode interactions. We determine finite volume corrections to the Compton scattering tensor of pions. We argue, however, that such results cannot be used to ascertain volume corrections to polarizabilities determined in lattice QCD with background field methods. Connection is lacking because momentum expansions are not permitted in finite volume. Our argument also applies to form factors. Volume effects for electromagnetic moments cannot be deduced from finite volume form factors.",

We first review a selection of approaches that have been used in lattice calculations to determine multiple energy states: multiple correlator fits, the variational method and Bayesian fitting. In the second half, we will focus on a black box method, the multi-effective mass. We demonstrate the approach on anisotropic lattice data, extracting multiple states from single correlators. Without complicated operator construction or specialized fitting programs, the black box method shows good consistency with the traditional approaches.",

      "summary": "In a system where chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, the low energy eigenmodes of the continuum Dirac operator are extended. On the lattice, due to discretization effects, the Dirac operator can have localized eigenmodes that affect physical quantities sensitive to chiral symmetry. While the infrared eigenmodes of the Wilson Dirac operator are usually extended even on coarse lattices, the chiral overlap operator has many localized eigenmodes in the physical region, especially in mixed action simulations. Depending on their density, these modes can introduce strong lattice artifacts. The effect can be controlled by changing the parameters of the overlap operator, in particular the clover improvement term and the center of the overlap projection.",

We then apply this effective field theory to the hadron spectrum and dispersion relations, focussing on the corrections due to the anisotropy. We point out an important feature of anisotropic lattices regarding the Aoki-regime; for a given set of fermion masses and spatial lattice spacing, if an isotropic action is in the QCD-phase, this does not guarantee that the anisotropic action is outside the Aoki-regime. This may be important in the tuning of bare parameters for anisotropic lattices using domain-wall and overlap fermions as well as Wilson and O(a)-improved Wilson fermions.",

For massless quarks, this theory has an $SU_L(2)\\times SU_R(2) \\times U_A(1)$ symmetry. By adding a four-fermion term we can break the U_A(1) symmetry and thus incorporate the physics of the QCD anomaly. We can also tune the pion decay constant F, to be small compared to the lattice cutoff by starting with an extra fictitious dimension, thus allowing us to model low energy pion physics in a setting similar to lattice QCD from first principles. However, unlike lattice QCD, a major advantage of our model is that we can easily design efficient algorithms to compute a variety of quantities in the chiral limit. Here we show that the model reproduces the predictions of chiral perturbation theory in the $ε$-regime.",

The meson masses are calculated on lattice QCD configurations generated by the RBC Collaboration for two flavors of dynamical domain wall fermions, which are combined with QED configurations generated via quenched non-compact lattice QED. The electromagnetic part of the pion mass splitting is found to be $m_{π^+}-m_{π^0}=4.12(21)$ MeV, where only the statistical error is quoted, and similarly for the kaon, 1.443(55) MeV. Our results for the light quark masses are $m_u^{\\rm\\bar{MS}}$(2 GeV)=$3.02(27)(19)$ MeV, $m_d^{\\rm\\bar{MS}}$(2 GeV)=$5.49(20)(34)$ MeV, and $m_s^{\\rm\\bar{MS}}$(2 GeV)=$119.5(56)(74)$ MeV, where the first error is statistical and the second systematic. By averaging over $\\pm e$ to cancel ${\\cal O}(e)$ noise exactly on each combined gauge field configuration, we are able to work at physical $α=1/137$ and obtain very small statistical errors. In our calculation, several sources of systematic error remain, including finite volume, non-zero lattice spacing, chiral extrapolation, quenched QED, and quenched strange quark, which may be more significant than the errors quoted above.",

In the chiral limit we find that the quark spectral function has two collective modes which correspond to the normal and plasmino excitations. At large values of the bare quark mass the spectral function is dominated by a single pole.",

      "summary": "The study of one or more baryons in lattice QCD is severely hindered by the exponential decay in time of the signal-to-noise ratio. The rate at which the signal-to-noise decreases is a function of the the pion mass. More precisely, it depends on the minimum allowed pion energy in the box, which, for periodic boundary conditions, is equal to its mass. We propose a set of boundary conditions, given by a \"parity orbifold'' construction, which eliminates the zero momentum pion modes, raising the minimum pion energy without altering the QCD ground state, and thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio of (multi)-baryon correlation functions at long Euclidean times. We discuss variations of these \"restless pions\" boundary conditions and focus on their impact on the study of nuclear forces.",

The study is performed on quenched anisotropic lattices with clover quarks at the charm mass. We demonstrate how a knowledge of the continuum limit of a lattice interpolating field can give additional spin-assignment information, even at a single lattice spacing, via the overlap factors of interpolating field and state. Excited state masses are systematically high with respect to quark potential model predictions and, where they exist, experimental states. We conclude that this is most likely a result of the quenched approximation.",

      "summary": "In this work, I report the latest lattice QCD calculations of nucleon and hyperon structure from chiral fermions in 2+1-flavor dynamical simulations. All calculations are done with a chirally symmetric fermion action, domain-wall fermions, for valence quarks. % I begin with the latest lattice results on the nucleon structure, focusing on results from RBC/UKQCD using 2+1-flavor chiral fermion actions. We find the chiral-extrapolated axial coupling constant at physical pion mass point to be 1.23(5), consistent with experimental value. The renormalization constants for the structure functions are obtained from RI/MOM-scheme non-perturbative renormalization. We find first moments of the polarized and unpolarized nucleon structure functions at zero transfer momentum to be 0.133(13) and 0.203(23) respectively, using continuum chiral extrapolation. These are consistent with the experimental values, unlike previous calculations which have been 50% larger. We also have a prediction for the transversity, which we find to be 0.56(4). The twist-3 matrix element is consistent with zero which agrees with the prediction of the Wandzura-Wilczek relation.\n  In the second half of this work, I report an indirect dynamical estimation of the strangeness proton magnetic moments using mixed actions. With the analysis of hyperon form factors and using charge symmetry, the strangeness of proton is found to be $-0.066(26)$, consistent with the Adelaide-JLab Collaboration's result. The hyperon $Σ$ and $Ξ$ axial coupling constants are also performed for the first time in a lattice calculation, $g_{ΣΣ}= 0.441(14)$ and $g_{ΞΞ} = -0.277(11)$.",

      "summary": "With sufficiently light up and down quarks the isovector ($a_0$) and isosinglet ($f_0$) scalar meson propagators are dominated at large distance by two-meson states. In the staggered fermion formulation of lattice quantum chromodynamics, taste-symmetry breaking causes a proliferation of two-meson states that further complicates the analysis of these channels. Many of them are unphysical artifacts of the lattice approximation. They are expected to disappear in the continuum limit. The staggered-fermion fourth-root procedure has its purported counterpart in rooted staggered chiral perturbation theory (rSXPT). Fortunately, the rooted theory provides a strict framework that permits the analysis of scalar meson correlators in terms of only a small number of low energy couplings. Thus the analysis of the point-to-point scalar meson correlators in this context gives a useful consistency check of the fourth-root procedure and its proposed chiral realization. Through numerical simulation we have measured correlators for both the $a_0$ and $f_0$ channels in the ``Asqtad'' improved staggered fermion formulation in a lattice ensemble with lattice spacing $a = 0.12$ fm. We analyze those correlators in the context of rSXPT and obtain values of the low energy chiral couplings that are reasonably consistent with previous determinations.",

The first system is solved with a deflated GMRES method that generates eigenvector information at the same time that the linear equations are solved. Subsequent systems are solved by combining restarted GMRES with a projection over the previously determined eigenvectors. This approach offers an alternative to block methods, and it can also be combined with a block method. It is useful when there are a limited number of small eigenvalues that slow the convergence. An example is given showing significant improvement for a problem from quantum chromodynamics. The second and subsequent right-hand sides are solved much quicker than without the deflation. This new approach is relatively simple to implement and is very efficient compared to other deflation methods.",

Restarted GMRES can be improved by deflating eigenvalues for matrices that have a few small eigenvalues. We show that a particular deflated method, GMRES-DR, can be applied to multiply shifted systems. In quantum chromodynamics, it is common to have multiple right-hand sides with multiple shifts for each right-hand side. We develop a method that efficiently solves the multiple right-hand sides by using a deflated version of GMRES and yet keeps costs for all of the multiply shifted systems close to those for one shift. An example is given showing this can be extremely effective with a quantum chromodynamics matrix.",

      "title": "Computing and deflating eigenvalues while solving multiple right hand side linear systems in Quantum Chromodynamics",
      "summary": "We present a new algorithm that computes eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Hermitian positive definite matrix while solving a linear system of equations with Conjugate Gradient (CG). Traditionally, all the CG iteration vectors could be saved and recombined through the eigenvectors of the tridiagonal projection matrix, which is equivalent theoretically to unrestarted Lanczos. Our algorithm capitalizes on the iteration vectors produced by CG to update only a small window of vectors that approximate the eigenvectors. While this window is restarted in a locally optimal way, the CG algorithm for the linear system is unaffected. Yet, in all our experiments, this small window converges to the required eigenvectors at a rate identical to unrestarted Lanczos. After the solution of the linear system, eigenvectors that have not accurately converged can be improved in an incremental fashion by solving additional linear systems. In this case, eigenvectors identified in earlier systems can be used to deflate, and thus accelerate, the convergence of subsequent systems. We have used this algorithm with excellent results in lattice QCD applications, where hundreds of right hand sides may be needed. Specifically, about 70 eigenvectors are obtained to full accuracy after solving 24 right hand sides. Deflating these from the large number of subsequent right hand sides removes the dreaded critical slowdown, where the conditioning of the matrix increases as the quark mass reaches a critical value. Our experiments show almost a constant number of iterations for our method, regardless of quark mass, and speedups of 8 over original CG for light quark masses.",

      "summary": "A calculational scheme for obtaining the electric polarizability of the neutron in lattice QCD with dynamical quarks is developed, using the background field approach. The scheme differs substantially from methods previously used in the quenched approximation, the physical reason being that the QCD ensemble is no longer independent of the external electromagnetic field in the dynamical quark case. One is led to compute (certain integrals over) four-point functions. Particular emphasis is also placed on the physical role of constant external gauge fields on a finite lattice; the presence of these fields complicates the extraction of polarizabilities, since it gives rise to an additional shift of the neutron mass unrelated to polarizability effects. The method is tested on a SU(3) flavor-symmetric ensemble furnished by the MILC Collaboration, corresponding to a pion mass of m_pi = 759 MeV. Disconnected diagrams are evaluated using stochastic estimation. A small negative electric polarizability of alpha =(-2.0 +/- 0.9) 10^(-4) fm^3 is found for the neutron at this rather large pion mass; this result does not seem implausible in view of the qualitative behavior of alpha as a function of m_pi suggested by Chiral Effective Theory.",

      "summary": "A generalization of the AdS/CFT conjecture postulates a duality between IIA string theory and 16 supercharge Yang-Mills quantum mechanics in the large N 't Hooft limit. At low temperatures string theory describes black holes, whose thermodynamics may hence be studied using the dual quantum mechanics. This quantum mechanics is strongly coupled which motivates the use of lattice techniques. We argue that, contrary to expectation, the theory when discretized naively will nevertheless recover continuum supersymmetry as the lattice spacing is sent to zero. We test these ideas by studying the 4 supercharge version of this Yang-Mills quantum mechanics in the 't Hooft limit. We use both a naive lattice action and a manifestly supersymmetric action. Using Monte Carlo methods we simulate the Euclidean theories, and study the lattice continuum limit, for both thermal and non-thermal periodic boundary conditions, confirming continuum supersymmetry is recovered for the naive action when appropriate. We obtain results for the thermal system with N up to 12. These favor the existence of a single deconfined phase for all non-zero temperatures. These results are an encouraging indication that the 16 supercharge theory is within reach using similar methods and resources.",

Concerning m_res, I compare the analysis of chiral symmetry breaking to that with Wilson fermions, emphasizing that DWF are better than simply Wilson fermions with each chiral symmetry breaking effect reduced by a common factor.

      "summary": "Mixed action theories with chirally symmetric valence fermions exhibit very desirable features both at the level of the lattice calculations as well as in the construction and implementation of the low energy mixed action effective field theory. In this work we show that when such a mixed action effective field theory is projected onto the valence sector, both the Lagrangian and the extrapolation formulae become universal in form through next to leading order, for all variants of discretization methods used for the sea fermions. Our conclusion relies on the chiral nature of the valence quarks. The result implies that for all sea quark methods which are in the same universality class as QCD, the numerical values of the physical coefficients in the various mixed action chiral Lagrangians will be the same up to lattice spacing dependent corrections. This allows us to construct a prescription to determine the mixed action extrapolation formulae for a large class of hadronic correlation functions computed in partially quenched chiral perturbation theory at the one-loop level. For specific examples, we apply this prescription to the nucleon twist--2 matrix elements and the nucleon--nucleon system. In addition, we determine the mixed action extrapolation formula for the neutron EDM as this provides a nice example of a theta-dependent observable; these observables are exceptions to our prescription.",

      "summary": "We study quarkonium correlators and spectral functions at zero and finite temperature in QCD with only heavy quarks using potential models combined with perturbative QCD. First, we show that this approach can describe the quarkonium correlation function at zero temperature. Using a class of screened potentials based on lattice calculations of the static quark-antiquark free energy we calculate spectral functions at finite temperature. We find that all quarkonium states, with the exception of the $1S$ bottomonium, dissolve in the deconfined phase at temperatures smaller than $1.5T_c$, in contradiction with the conclusions of recent studies. Despite this the temperature dependence of the quarkonium correlation functions calculated on the lattice is well reproduced in our model. We also find that even in the absence of resonances the spectral function at high temperatures is significantly enhanced over the spectral function corresponding to free quark antiquark propagation.",

      "summary": "Mixed action lattice calculations allow for an additive lattice spacing dependent mass renormalization of mesons composed of one sea and one valence quark, regardless of the type of fermion discretization methods used in the valence and sea sectors. The value of the mass renormalization depends upon the lattice actions used. This mixed meson mass shift is an important lattice artifact to determine for mixed action calculations; because it modifies the pion mass, it plays a central role in the low energy dynamics of all hadronic correlation functions. We determine the leading order, $\\mathcal{O}(a^2)$, and next to leading order, $\\mathcal{O}(a^2 m_π^2)$, additive mass shift of \\textit{valence-sea} mesons for a mixed lattice action with domain-wall valence fermions and rooted staggered sea fermions, relevant to the majority of current large scale mixed action lattice efforts. We find that on the asqtad improved coarse MILC lattices, this additive mass shift is well parameterized in lattice units by $Δ(am)^2 = 0.034(2) -0.06(2) (a m_π)^2$, which in physical units, using $a=0.125$ fm, corresponds to $Δ(m)^2 = (291\\pm 8 \\textrm{MeV})^2 -0.06(2) m_π^2$. In terms of the mixed action effective field theory parameters, the corresponding mass shift is given by $a^2 Δ_\\mathrm{Mix} = (316 \\pm 4 \\textrm{MeV})^2$ at leading order plus next-to-leading order corrections including the necessary chiral logarithms for this mixed action calculation, determined in this work. Within the precision of our calculation, one can not distinguish between the full next-to-leading order effective field theory analysis of this additive mixed meson mass shift and the parameterization given above.",

Our model has the right chiral symmetries and can be studied efficiently with cluster algorithms. In particular we can tune the strength of the QCD anomaly and thus study its effects on the chiral phase transition. Our study confirms the widely accepted view point that the chiral phase transition is first order in the absence of the anomaly. Turning on the anomaly weakens the transition and turns it second order at a critical anomaly strength. The anomaly strength at the tricritical point is characterized using $r = (M_{η'}-M_π)/ρ_{η'}$ where $M_{η'}, M_π$ are the screening masses of the anomalous and regular pions and $ρ_{η'}$ is the mass-scale that governs the low energy fluctuations of the anomalous symmetry. We estimate that $r \\sim 7 $ in our model. This suggests that a strong anomaly at the two-flavor QCD chiral phase transition is necessary to wash out the first order transition.",

We take the light meson in the final state to be a pseudoscalar corresponding to the exact chiral symmetry of staggered quarks. The treatment assumes the validity of the standard prescription for representing the staggered ``fourth root trick'' within \\schpt by insertions of factors of 1/4 for each sea quark loop. Our calculation is based on an existing partially quenched continuum chiral perturbation theory calculation with degenerate sea quarks by Becirevic, Prelovsek and Zupan, which we generalize to the staggered (and non-degenerate) case. As a by-product, we obtain the continuum partially quenched results with non-degenerate sea quarks. We analyze the effects of non-leading chiral terms, and find a relation among the coefficients governing the analytic valence mass dependence at this order. Our results are useful in analyzing lattice computations of form factors $B\\toπ$ and $D\\to K$ when the light quarks are simulated with the staggered action.",

      "summary": "We propose to study hadron-hadron scattering using lattice QCD in an asymmetric box which allows one to access more non-degenerate low-momentum modes for a given volume. The conventional Lüscher's formula applicable in a symmetric box is modified accordingly. To illustrate the feasibility of this approach, pion-pion elastic scattering phase shifts in the I=2, J=0 channel are calculated within quenched approximation using improved gauge and Wilson fermion actions on anisotropic lattices in an asymmetric box. After the chiral and continuum extrapolation, we find that our quenched results for the scattering phase shifts in this channel are consistent with the experimental data when the three-momentum of the pion is below 300MeV. Agreement is also found when compared with previous theoretical results from lattice and other means. Moreover, with the usage of asymmetric volume, we are able to compute the scattering phases in the low-momentum range (pion three momentum less than about 350MeV in the center of mass frame) for over a dozen values of the pion three-momenta, much more than using the conventional symmetric box with comparable volume.",

      "summary": "The potentials between two B-mesons are computed in the heavy-quark limit using quenched lattice QCD at $m_π\\sim 400~{\\rm MeV}$. Non-zero central potentials are clearly evident in all four spin-isospin channels, (I,s_l) = (0,0) , (0,1) , (1,0) , (1,1), where s_l is the total spin of the light degrees of freedom. At short distance, we find repulsion in the $I\\ne s_l$ channels and attraction in the I=s_l channels. Linear combinations of these potentials that have well-defined spin and isospin in the t-channel are found, in three of the four cases, to have substantially smaller uncertainties than the potentials defined with the s-channel (I,s_l), and allow quenching artifacts from single hairpin exchange to be isolated. The BB*πcoupling extracted from the long-distance behavior of the finite-volume t-channel potential is found to be consistent with quenched calculations of the matrix element of the isovector axial-current. The tensor potentials in both of the s_l = 1 channels are found to be consistent with zero within calculational uncertainties.",

      "summary": "Scattering observables can be computed in lattice field theory by measuring the volume dependence of energy levels of two particle states. The dominant volume dependence, proportional to inverse powers of the volume, is determined by the phase shifts. This universal relation (\\Lu's formula) between energy levels and phase shifts is distorted by corrections which, in the large volume limit, are exponentially suppressed. They may be sizable, however, for the volumes used in practice and they set a limit on how small the lattice can be in these studies. We estimate these corrections, mostly in the case of two nucleons. Qualitatively, we find that the exponentially suppressed corrections are proportional to the {\\it square} of the potential (or to terms suppressed in the chiral expansion) and the effect due to pions going ``around the world'' vanishes. Quantitatively, the size of the lattice should be greater than $\\approx(5 {fm})^3$ in order to keep finite volume corrections to the phase less than $1^\\circ$ for realistic pion mass.",

Path integrals in quantum field theory are reviewed, and their evaluation by the Monte Carlo method with Markov-chain based importance sampling is presented. Properties of Markov chains are discussed in detail and several proofs are presented, culminating in the fundamental limit theorem for irreducible Markov chains. The example of a real scalar field theory is used to illustrate the Metropolis-Hastings method and to demonstrate the effectiveness of an action-preserving (microcanonical) local updating algorithm in reducing autocorrelations. The goal of these lectures is to provide the beginner with the basic skills needed to start carrying out Monte Carlo studies in quantum field theories, as well as to present the underlying theoretical foundations of the method.",

      "summary": "A popular approximation in lattice gauge theory is an extrapolation in the number of fermion species away from the four fold degeneracy natural with the staggered fermion formulation. I show that the extrapolation procedure mutilates the expected continuum holomorphic behavior in the quark masses. The conventional resolution proposes canceling the unphysical singularities with a plethora of extra states appearing at finite lattice spacing. This unproven conjecture requires an explicit loss of unitarity and locality. Even if correct, the approach implies large cutoff effects in the low-energy flavor-neutral sector.",

      "title": "Nonlinear Aspects of the Renormalization Group Flows of Dyson's Hierarchical Model",
      "summary": "We review recent results concerning the renormalization group (RG) transformation of Dyson's hierarchical model (HM). This model can be seen as an approximation of a scalar field theory on a lattice. We introduce the HM and show that its large group of symmetry simplifies drastically the blockspinning procedure. Several equivalent forms of the recursion formula are presented with unified notations. Rigorous and numerical results concerning the recursion formula are summarized. It is pointed out that the recursion formula of the HM is inequivalent to both Wilson's approximate recursion formula and Polchinski's equation in the local potential approximation (despite the very small difference with the exponents of the latter). We draw a comparison between the RG of the HM and other RG equations in the local potential approximation. The construction of the linear and nonlinear scaling variables is discussed in an operational way. We describe the calculation of non-universal critical amplitudes in terms of the scaling variables of two fixed points. This question appears as a problem of interpolation between these fixed points. Universal amplitude ratios are calculated. We discuss the large-N limit and the complex singularities of the critical potential calculable in this limit. The interpolation between the HM and more conventional lattice models is presented as a symmetry breaking problem. We briefly introduce models with an approximate supersymmetry. One important goal of this review article is to present a configuration space counterpart, suitable for lattice formulations, of other RG equations formulated in momentum space (sometimes abbreviated as ERGE).",

      "summary": "We present results for light meson masses and pseudoscalar decay constants from the first of a series of lattice calculations with 2+1 dynamical flavors of domain wall fermions and the Iwasaki gauge action. The work reported here was done at a fixed lattice spacing of about 0.12 fm on a 16^3\\times32 lattice, which amounts to a spatial volume of (2 fm)^3 in physical units. The number of sites in the fifth dimension is 16, which gives m_{res} = 0.00308(4) in these simulations. Three values of input light sea quark masses, m_l^{sea} \\approx 0.85 m_s, 0.59 m_s and 0.33 m_s were used to allow for extrapolations to the physical light quark limit, whilst the heavier sea quark mass was fixed to approximately the physical strange quark mass m_s. The exact rational hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm was used to evaluate the fractional powers of the fermion determinants in the ensemble generation. We have found that f_π= 127(4) MeV, f_K = 157(5) MeV and f_K/f_π= 1.24(2), where the errors are statistical only, which are in good agreement with the experimental values.",

      "summary": "In lattice gauge theory (LGT) equilibrium simulations of QCD are usually performed with periodic boundary conditions (BCs). In contrast to that deconfined regions created in heavy ion collisions are bordered by the confined phase. Here we discuss BCs in LGT, which model a cold exterior of the lattice volume. Subsequently we perform Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of pure SU(3) LGT with a thus inspired simple change of BCs using volumes of a size comparable to those typically encountered in the BNL relativistic heavy ion collider (RHIC) experiment. Corrections to the usual LGT results survive in the finite volume continuum limit and we estimate them as function of the volume size. In magnitude they are found comparable to those of including quarks. As observables we use a pseudocritical temperature, which rises opposite to the effect of quarks, and the width of the transition, which broadens similar to the effect of quarks.",

      "summary": "The Yukawa-Higgs/Ginsparg-Wilson-fermion construction of chiral lattice gauge theories described in hep-lat/0605003 uses exact lattice chirality to decouple the massless chiral fermions from a mirror sector, whose strong dynamics is conjectured to give cutoff-scale mass to the mirror fermions without breaking the chiral gauge symmetry. In this paper, we study the mirror sector dynamics of a two-dimensional chiral gauge theory in the limitof strong Yukawa and vanishing gauge couplings, in which case it reduces to an XY model coupled to Ginsparg-Wilson fermions. For the mirror fermions to acquire cutoff-scale mass it is believed to be important that the XY model remain in its \"high temperature\" phase, where there is no algebraic ordering--a conjecture supported by the results of our work. We use analytic and Monte-Carlo methods with dynamical fermions to study the scalar and fermion susceptibilities, and the mirror fermion spectrum. Our results provide convincing evidence that the strong dynamics does not \"break\" the chiral symmetry (more precisely, that the mirror fermions do not induce algebraic ordering in two-dimensions), and that the mirror fermions decouple from the infrared physics.",
