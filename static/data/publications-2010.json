Second an RI/MOM subtraction to remove the short distance part of this matrix element in a fashion consistent with the calculation of the physical short distance part. Third an application of the Lellouch-Luscher method, generalized to second order in the weak interactions, to control finite volume errors.

To enable the exact evaluation of the disconnected loops we use a $16^3 \\times 32$ lattice and $N_f=2$ Wilson fermions simulated by the SESAM Collaboration. The disconnected loops are also computed using stochastic methods with several noise reduction techniques.\n  In particular, we analyze various dilution schemes as well as the recently proposed truncated s olver method. We find consistency among the different methods used for the determination of the $η^\\prime$ mass, albeit that the gauge noise for the ensemble studied is large. We also find that the effect of 'dilution' d oes not go beyond that of optimal statistical noise in many cases. It has been observed, however, that spin dilution does have a significant effect for some quantities studied.",

      "summary": "We calculate the vector current correlation function for light valence quarks in the deconfined phase of QCD. The calculations have been performed in quenched lattice QCD at T=1.45 Tc for four values of the lattice cut-off on lattices up to size 128^3x48. This allows to perform a continuum extrapolation of the correlation function in the Euclidean time interval tau*T -in [0.2, 0.5], which extends to the largest temporal separations possible at finite temperature, to better than 1% accuracy. In this interval, at the value of the temperature investigated, we find that the vector correlation function never deviates from the free correlator for massless quarks by more than 9%. We also determine the first two non-vanishing thermal moments of the vector meson spectral function. The second thermal moment deviates by less than 7% from the free value. With these constraints, we then proceed to extract information on the spectral representation of the vector correlator and discuss resulting consequences for the electrical conductivity and the thermal dilepton rate in the plasma phase.",

      "summary": "QCD lattice simulations with 2+1 flavours typically start at rather large up-down and strange quark masses and extrapolate first the strange quark mass to its physical value and then the up-down quark mass. An alternative method of tuning the quark masses is discussed here in which the singlet quark mass is kept fixed, which ensures that the kaon always has mass less than the physical kaon mass. Using group theory the possible quark mass polynomials for a Taylor expansion about the flavour symmetric line are found, which enables highly constrained fits to be used in the extrapolation of hadrons to the physical pion mass. Numerical results confirm the usefulness of this expansion and an extrapolation to the physical pion mass gives hadron mass values to within a few percent of their experimental values.",

      "summary": "We determine the neutral kaon mixing matrix element $B_K$ in the continuum limit with 2+1 flavors of domain wall fermions, using the Iwasaki gauge action at two different lattice spacings. These lattice fermions have near exact chiral symmetry and therefore avoid artificial lattice operator mixing.\n  We introduce a significant improvement to the conventional NPR method in which the bare matrix elements are renormalized non-perturbatively in the RI-MOM scheme and are then converted into the MSbar scheme using continuum perturbation theory. In addition to RI-MOM, we introduce and implement four non-exceptional intermediate momentum schemes that suppress infrared non-perturbative uncertainties in the renormalization procedure. We compute the conversion factors relating the matrix elements in this family of RI-SMOM schemes and MSbar at one-loop order. Comparison of the results obtained using these different intermediate schemes allows for a more reliable estimate of the unknown higher-order contributions and hence for a correspondingly more robust estimate of the systematic error. We also apply a recently proposed approach in which twisted boundary conditions are used to control the Symanzik expansion for off-shell vertex functions leading to a better control of the renormalization in the continuum limit.\n  We control chiral extrapolation errors by considering both the NLO SU(2) chiral effective theory, and an analytic mass expansion. We obtain $B_K^{\\msbar}(3 GeV) = 0.529(5)_{stat}(15)_χ(2)_{FV}(11)_{NPR}$. This corresponds to $\\hat{B}_K = 0.749(7)_{stat}(21)_χ(3)_{FV}(15)_{NPR}$. Adding all sources of error in quadrature we obtain $\\hat{B}_K = 0.749(27)_{combined}$, with an overall combined error of 3.6%.",

      "summary": "We present perturbative and non-perturbative results on the renormalization constants of the local and one-derivative vector and axial vector operators. Non-perturbative results are obtained using the twistedmassWilson fermion formulation employing two degenerate dynamical quarks and the tree-level Symanzik improved gluon action for pion masses in the range of about 450-260 MeV and at there values of the lattice spacing, namely 0.055 fm, 0.070 fm and 0.089 fm. Subtraction of O(a^2) terms is carried out by performing the perturbative evaluation of these operators at 1- loop and up to O(a^2). The renormalization conditions are defined in the RI'-MOM scheme, for both perturbative and non-perturbative results. The Z-factors, obtained for different values of the renormalization scale, are evolved perturbatively to a reference scale set by the inverse of the lattice spacing. In addition, they are translated to MS-bar at 2 GeV using 3-loop perturbative results for the conversion factors.",

We compute the simultaneous two-quark density of a diquark, including corrections for periodic boundary conditions. We define a correlation function to isolate the intrinsic correlations of the diquark and reduce the effects caused by the presence of the static quark. Away from the immediate vicinity of the static quark, the diquark has a consistent shape, with much stronger correlations seen in the good (scalar) diquark than in the bad (vector) diquark. We present results for m_π=293 MeV in N_f=2+1 QCD as well as m_π=940 MeV in quenched QCD, and discuss the dependence of the spatial size on the pion mass.",

We make use of a recent analysis of the magnetic equation of state in (2+1)-flavor QCD where a connection between the QCD parameters and the universal scaling fields could be established. The remaining dependence of the reduced temperature on the chemical potential can be fixed by an analysis of a mixed susceptibility, obtained from a derivative with respect to quark mass and chemical potential. We extract this dependence which describes the curvature of the phase transition line, at two values of the cut-off, $aT=1/4$ and $1/8$. We find that cut-off effects are small for the curvature parameter and determine the transition line in the chiral limit to leading order in the light quark chemical potential. We obtain $T_c(μ_B)/T_c(0) = 1 - 0.00656(66) (μ_B/T)^2 +{\\cal O}(μ_B^4)$.",

We aim to estimate nonperturbatively the size of the resulting correction, which may eventually be needed in high precision calculations of the charmonium spectrum. We study this problem in the quenched and unquenched QCD cases. On dynamical ensembles the disconnected charmonium propagators contain light modes which complicate the extraction of the signal at large distances. In the fully quenched case, where there are no such light modes, the interpretation of the signal is simplified. We present results from lattices with $a\\approx 0.09$ fm and $a\\approx 0.06$ fm.",

Better taste symmetry on the lattice can be achieved either by decreasing the lattice spacing and going to larger temporal extent in finite-temperature calculations, or by further improving the action. The highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action offers a further degree of improvement and substantially reduces taste violations. We report on our studies of the 2+1 flavor QCD thermodynamics with the HISQ/tree action. By systematically comparing HISQ/tree, asqtad, p4 and stout calculations we quantify how the cut-off effects manifest themselves in different thermodynamic quantities, including the renormalized Polyakov loop, chiral condensate, various fluctuations and correlations of conserved charges. The implications for the equation of state and a comparison to the hadron resonance gas model are also discussed. The chiral aspects of the finite-temperature transition are discussed in the companion HotQCD contribution [1].",

Volume effects are examined using simulations at two volumes of spatial length $L=2.1$ fm and $L=2.8$ fm. Cut-off effects are investigated using three different values of the lattice spacings, namely $a=0.089$ fm, $a=0.070$ fm and $a=0.056$ fm. The nucleon axial charge is obtained in the continuum limit and chirally extrapolated to the physical pion mass enabling comparison with experiment.",

We employ the Wilson gauge and fermion actions on an anisotropic 24^3 x 64 lattice, probing a range of momentum transfer with Q^2 < 1 GeV^2. The strange electric and magnetic form factors, G_E^s(Q^2) and G_M^s(Q^2), are found to be small and consistent with zero within the statistics of our calculation. The lattice data favor a small negative value for the strange axial form factor G_A^s(Q^2) and exhibit a strong signal for the bare strange scalar matrix element <N|ss|N>_0. We discuss the unique systematic uncertainties affecting the latter quantity relative to the continuum, as well as prospects for improving future determinations with Wilson-like fermions.",

      "summary": "By determining the quark momentum fractions of the octet baryons from N_f=2+1 lattice simulations, we are able to predict the degree of charge symmetry violation in the parton distribution functions of the nucleon. This is of importance, not only as a probe of our understanding of the non-perturbative structure of the proton but also because such a violation constrains the accuracy of global fits to parton distribution functions and hence the accuracy with which, for example, cross sections at the LHC can be predicted. A violation of charge symmetry may also be critical in cases where symmetries are used to guide the search for physics beyond the Standard Model.",

In this letter, as a trial of the method, we report on the extraction of the non-resonant phase-shift for S and D-wave pi-pi isospin-2 scattering from dynamical lattice QCD computations. We define a variational basis of operators resembling pairs of pions of definite relative momentum and extract a spectrum of excited states that maps to phase-shifts at a set of discrete scattering momenta. Computations are performed with pion masses between 400 and 520 MeV on multiple spatial volumes. We observe no significant quark mass dependence in the phase-shifts extracted which are in reasonable agreement with the available experimental data at low momentum.",

In our previous study we found that the polarizability for this system is negative which is believed to be a finite volume artifact. To address this issue, we carry out simulations for different lattice sizes and we also look at the influence of the boundary conditions on these results. We find that for pion masses lower than 400 MeV the polarizability remains negative even on larger lattices. An infinite volume extrapolation is attempted, but the results are not conclusive due mainly to a lack of an analytical form for the finite volume corrections for this system.",

      "title": "Perturbative renormalization factors and O(a^2) corrections for lattice 4-fermion operators with improved fermion/gluon actions",
      "summary": "In this work we calculate the corrections to the amputated Green's functions of 4-fermion operators, in 1-loop Lattice Perturbation theory. One of the novel aspects of our calculations is that they are carried out to O(a^2) (a: lattice spacing). We employ the Wilson/clover action for massless fermions (also applicable for the twisted mass action in the chiral limit) and a family of Symanzik improved actions for gluons. Our calculations have been carried out in a general covariant gauge. Results have been obtained for several popular choices of values for the Symanzik coefficients. While our Green's function calculations regard any pointlike 4-fermion operators which do not mix with lower dimension ones, we pay particular attention to DF=2 operators, both Parity Conserving and Parity Violating (F: flavour). We compute the perturbative renormalization constants for a complete basis of 4-fermion operators and we study their mixing pattern. For some of the actions considered here, even O(a^0) results did not exist in the literature to date. The correction terms which we calculate are essential ingredients for minimizing the lattice artifacts which are present in non-perturbative evaluations of renormalization constants with the RI'-MOM method. Our perturbative results, for the matrix elements of DF=2 operators and for the corresponding renormalization matrices, depend on a large number of parameters: coupling constant, number of colors, lattice spacing, external momentum, clover parameter, Symanzik coefficients, gauge parameter. To make these results most easily accessible, we have included them in the distribution package of this paper, as an ASCII file named: 4-fermi.m; the file is best perused as Mathematica input. The main results of this work have been applied to improve non-perturbative estimates of the B_K-parameter in N_F=2 twisted mass lattice QCD.",

In this talk, we present results of the first numerical simulations with this action (the OK action), where we study the masses of the quarkonium and heavy-light systems. We calculate combinations of masses designed to test improvement and compare results obtained with the OK action to their counterparts obtained with the clover action. Our preliminary results show a clear improvement.",

It improves, however, upon the traditional \"indirect'' approach of constructing the K --> pi pi matrix elements using NLO SU(3) ChPT, which can lead to large higher-order chiral corrections. Using the explicit example of the Delta I =3/2 (27,1) operator to illustrate the method, we obtain a value for Re(A_2) that agrees with experiment and has a total uncertainty of ~20%. Although our simulations use domain-wall valence quarks on the MILC asqtad-improved gauge configurations, this method is more general and can be applied to calculations with any fermion formulation.",

All these results are confronted with the predictions of the Hadron Resonance Gas model and Chiral Perturbation Theory for temperatures below the transition region. Our results can be reproduced by using the physical spectrum. The findings of the hotQCD collaboration can be recovered only by using a distorted spectrum. This analysis provides a simple explanation for the observed discrepancy in the transition T between our and the hotQCD collaborations.",

We use a prudent partially quenched choice of splitting the valence quark masses symmetrically about the light sea quark mass. This choice has the consequence of mitigating the most severe partial quenching artifacts. We also discuss the most significant hurdle to this method which is determining the electromagnetic self-energy of the neutron-proton mass splitting, a challenge which lacks a satisfactory answer. Despite these issues, the phenomenologically interesting dependence of m_n - m_p on delta can be determined.",

We show that for small values of the chemical potential the curvature of the phase transition line can be deduced from an analysis of scaling properties of the chiral condensate and its susceptibilities. To do so we extend earlier studies of the magnetic equation of state in (2+1)-flavor QCD to finer lattice spacings, aT=1/8. We use these universal scaling properties of the chiral order parameter to extract the curvature of the transition line at two values of the cut-off, aT=1/4 and 1/8. We find that cut-off effects are small for the curvature parameter and determine the transition line in the chiral limit to leading order in the light quark chemical potential. We obtain Tc(μ_q)/Tc(0) = 1 - 0.059(2)(4) (μ_q/T)^2 +O(μ_q^4).",

We support this picture with numerical calculations at finite volume for2D O(N) models in the large-N limit and the hierarchical Ising model using the two-lattice matching method. We present numerical evidence supporting the idea that, as the volume increases, the Fisher's zeros of 4-dimensional pure gauge SU(2) lattice gauge theory with a Wilson action, stabilize at a distance larger than 0.1 from the real axis in the complex beta=4/g^2 plane. We show that when a positive adjoint term is added, the zeros get closer to the real axis. We compare the situation with the U(1) case. We discuss the implications of this new framework for proofs of confinement and searches for nontrivial IR fixed points in models beyond the standard model.",

      "summary": "As part of our ongoing investigations of QCD with many flavors of quarks, here we report on studies of the finite temperature phase transition for eight-flavor QCD with the DBW2 gauge action and naïve staggered fermions. We find a clear first order phase transition between the chirally asymmetric phase at zero temperature and the chirally symmetric phase at finite temperature, signaled by a two-state signal for $\\langle\\barψψ\\rangle$ at a non-zero temperature. We see this signal at a gauge coupling of $β=0.54$, where, to set the scale, the zero temperature value for $f_π$, in the chiral limit, is 0.06661(92). This strong, first-order signal is seen for two different values of the quark mass, $m_q=0.007$ and 0.0195, at $N_τ=8$ and 6 respectively. Using $f_π(m_q)$ as the scale, the critical temperature is measured to be $T_c/f_π=1.638(93)$ at $m_π/f_π=3.329(30)$ for $m_q=0.007$, and $T_c/f_π=1.779(27)$ at $m_π/f_π=4.093(15)$ for $m_q=0.0195$. At a weaker coupling $β=0.56$, where at zero temperature and in the chiral limit we find $f_π=0.0312(10)$, the first order signal becomes numerically invisible to us for the $N_τ\\leq 14$ lattices we have investigated so far.",

      "summary": "Two-flavor chiral expansions provide a useful perturbative framework to study hadron properties. Such expansions should exhibit marked improvement over the conventional three-flavor chiral expansion. Although in principle one can formulate two-flavor theories for the various hyperon multiplets, the nearness of kaon thresholds can seriously undermine the effectiveness of such two-flavor theories in practice. We investigate the importance of virtual kaon thresholds on hyperon properties, specifically their isovector axial charges and electromagnetic observables. In particular we uncover the underlying expansion parameter governing the description of virtual kaon thresholds. For spin-half hyperons, this expansion parameter is under theoretical control. As a result, the virtual kaon contributions are well described in the two-flavor theory by terms analytic in the pion mass-squared. For spin three-half hyperons, however, one is closer to the kaon production threshold, and the expansion parameter is not as small. Breakdown of $SU(2)$ chiral perturbation theory is shown to arise from a pole in the expansion parameter associated with the kaon threshold. We find that, despite the fact that higher-order corrections to the expansion parameter is necessary to ascertain whether the two-flavor theory of spin three-half hyperons remains perturbative, there is a useful perturbative expansion for isovector axial charges and magnetic moments of both spin-half and spin three-half hyperons.",

Beyond results for x-integrated TMDs and quark densities, we present a study of correlations in x and transverse momentum. Our calculations are based on domain wall valence quark propagators by the LHP collaboration calculated on top of gauge configurations provided by MILC with 2+1 flavors of asqtad-improved staggered sea quarks.",

The QUDA library provides a package of mixed precision sparse matrix linear solvers for LQCD applications, supporting single GPUs based on NVIDIA's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). This library, interfaced to the QDP++/Chroma framework for LQCD calculations, is currently in production use on the \"9g\" cluster at the Jefferson Laboratory, enabling unprecedented price/performance for a range of problems in LQCD. Nevertheless, memory constraints on current GPU devices limit the problem sizes that can be tackled. In this contribution we describe the parallelization of the QUDA library onto multiple GPUs using MPI, including strategies for the overlapping of communication and computation. We report on both weak and strong scaling for up to 32 GPUs interconnected by InfiniBand, on which we sustain in excess of 4 Tflops.",

This calculation allow us to extract a preliminary prediction of $m_b(m_b, n_f = 5) = 4.25(12)$ GeV for the mass of the b quark from lattice NRQCD simulations performed with a lattice of spacing $a=0.12$fm. Our result is an improvement on a previous determination of the b quark mass from unquenched lattice NRQCD simulations, which was limited by the use of one-loop expressions for the energy shift. Our value is in good agreement with recent results of $m_b(m_b) = 4.163(16)$ GeV from QCD sum rules and $m_b(m_b, n_f = 5) = 4.170(25)$ GeV from realistic lattice simulations using highly-improved staggered quarks. We employ a mixed strategy to simplify our calculation. Ghost, gluon and counterterm contributions to the energy shift and mass renormalisation are extracted from quenched high-beta simulations whilst fermionic contributions are calculated using automated lattice perturbation theory. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of such a strategy.",

The latter technique is shown to expose a nilpotent, scalar supersymmetry which can be implemented exactly in the lattice theory. Using these ideas a lattice action for $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills in four dimensions can be written down which is gauge invariant, free of fermion doublers and respects one out of a total of 16 continuum supersymmetries. It is shown how these exact symmetries together with the large point group symmetry of the lattice strongly constrain the possible counterterms needed to renormalize the theory and hence determine how much residual fine tuning will be needed to restore all supersymmetries in the continuum limit. We report on progress to study these renormalization effects at one loop. We go on to give examples of applications of these supersymmetric lattice theories to explore the connections between gauge theories and gravity.",

This new method is found to enable controlled and precise continuum extrapolations and opens the way to compute the running of operators nonperturbatively in the Rome Southampton scheme. We describe this in detail and exhibit several examples of lattice step scaling functions.",

Our results are needed for our ongoing calculation of weak matrix elements using HYP-smeared staggered valence quarks and operators on MILC lattices. We give explicit results for matching factors of the operator needed to calculate $B_K$. We compare the impact of the improvement of the gauge action on one-loop coefficients with that of mean-field improvement of the operators.",

The analysis is done using fitting forms based on both SU(2) and SU(3) staggered chiral perturbation thery. For the SU(2) analysis, we find that the result using the NLO fit function is consistent with that from a partial NNLO fit. For the SU(3) analysis, where we have to use partially constrained fits due to the number of fit parameters, we find that our two preferred fits (\"N-BB1\" and \"N-BB2\") are also consistent, both with each other and with the results of the SU(2) fits.

Our main results are (1) the dependence on the light sea-quark mass is weaker than expected by naive dimensional analysis, (2) including finite volume effects in SU(2) staggered chiral perturbation theory fits leads to a very small change in $B_K$, of size $\\approx 0.1%$, and (3) increasing the statistics on one of the coarse MILC lattices resolves a potential discrepancy with other coarse results.",

This Chern Simons theory has been proposed as a definition of three dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity. Since the YM theory admits a discretization which preserves the values of topological observables we conjecture that it can be used as a non-perturbative definition of the quantum gravity theory.",

By using the Highly Improved Staggered Quark action for $u/d$, $s$ and $c$ quarks and NRQCD for the $b$ quarks, we are able to achieve an accuracy in the masses of around 10 MeV. Our results are: $m_B$ = 5.291(18) GeV, $m_{B_s}$ = 5.363(11) GeV and $m_{B_c}$ = 6.280(10) GeV. Note that all QCD parameters here are tuned from other calculations, so these are parameter free tests of QCD against experiment. We also give scalar, $B_{s0}^*$, and axial vector, $B_{s1}$, meson masses. We find these to be slightly below threshold for decay to $BK$ and $B^*K$ respectively.",

      "summary": "We present results for screening masses of mesons built from light and strange quarks in the temperature range of approximately between 140 MeV to 800 MeV. The lattice computations were performed with 2+1 dynamical light and strange flavors of improved (p4) staggered fermions along a line of constant physics defined by a pion mass of about 220 MeV and a kaon mass of 500 MeV. The lattices had temporal extents Nt = 4, 6 and 8 and aspect ratios of Ns / Nt \\geq 4. At least up to a temperature of 140 MeV the pseudo-scalar screening mass remains almost equal to the corresponding zero temperature pseudo-scalar (pole) mass. At temperatures around 3Tc (Tc being the transition temperature) the continuum extrapolated pseudo-scalar screening mass approaches very close to the free continuum result of 2 πT from below. On the other hand, at high temperatures the vector screening mass turns out to be larger than the free continuum value of 2 πT. The pseudo-scalar and the vector screening masses do not become degenerate even for a temperature as high as 4Tc. Using these mesonic spatial correlation functions we have also investigated the restoration of chiral symmetry and the effective restoration of the axial symmetry. We have found that the vector and the axial-vector screening correlators become degenerate, indicating chiral symmetry restoration, at a temperature which is consistent with the QCD transition temperature obtained in previous studies. On the other hand, the pseudo-scalar and the scalar screening correlators become degenerate only at temperatures larger than 1.3Tc, indicating that the effective restoration of the axial symmetry takes place at a temperature larger than the QCD transition temperature.",

A partially quenched setup is employed with two maximally twisted dynamical (sea) light Wilson quarks, and valence quarks of both the maximally twisted and the Osterwalder--Seiler variety. Suitable combinations of these two kinds of valence quarks lead to a lattice definition of the $B_{K}$ parameter which is both multiplicatively renormalizable and O($a$) improved. Employing the non-perturbative RI-MOM scheme, in the continuum limit and at the physical value of the pion mass we get $B^{\\rm RGI}_K=0.729\\pm 0.030$, a number well in line with the existing quenched and unquenched determinations.",

      "summary": "We propose a framework for quantitative evaluation of dynamical tendency for polarization in arbitrary random variable that can be decomposed into a pair of orthogonal subspaces. The method uses measures based on comparisons of given dynamics to its counterpart with statistically independent components. The formalism of previously considered X-distributions is used to express the aforementioned comparisons, in effect putting the former approach on solid footing. Our analysis leads to definition of a suitable correlation coefficient with clear statistical meaning. We apply the method to the dynamics induced by pure-glue lattice QCD in local left-right components of overlap Dirac eigenmodes. It is found that, in finite physical volume, there exists a non-zero physical scale in the spectrum of eigenvalues such that eigenmodes at smaller (fixed) eigenvalues exhibit convex X-distribution (positive correlation), while at larger eigenvalues the distribution is concave (negative correlation). This chiral polarization scale thus separates a regime where dynamics enhances chirality relative to statistical independence from a regime where it suppresses it, and gives an objective definition to the notion of \"low\" and \"high\" Dirac eigenmode. We propose to investigate whether the polarization scale remains non-zero in the infinite volume limit, in which case it would represent a new kind of low energy scale in QCD.",

The model also contains a coupling that can be used to break the $\\mathrm{U}_A(1)$ symmetry and thus mimic the QCD anomaly. At low temperatures $T$ and small baryon chemical potential $μ_B$ the model contains massless pions and massive bosonic baryons similar to QCD with an even number of colors. In this work we study the $T-μ_B$ phase diagram of the model and show that it contains three phases : (1) A chirally broken phase at low $T$ and $μ_B$, (2) a chirally symmetric baryon superfluid phase at low $T$ and high $μ_B$, and (3) a symmetric phase at high $T$. We find that the nature of the finite temperature chiral phase transition and in particular the location of the tricritical point that seperates the first order line from the second order line is affected significantly by the anomaly.",

      "summary": "We present results for kaon mixing parameter $B_K$ calculated using HYP-smeared improved staggered fermions on the MILC asqtad lattices. We use three lattice spacings ($a\\approx 0.12$, $0.09$ and $0.06\\;$fm), ten different valence quark masses ($m\\approx m_s/10-m_s$), and several light sea-quark masses in order to control the continuum and chiral extrapolations. We derive the next-to-leading order staggered chiral perturbation theory (SChPT) results necessary to fit our data, and use these results to do extrapolations based both on SU(2) and SU(3) SChPT. The SU(2) fitting is particularly straightforward because parameters related to taste-breaking and matching errors appear only at next-to-next-to-leading order. We match to the continuum renormalization scheme (NDR) using one-loop perturbation theory. Our final result is from the SU(2) analysis, with the SU(3) result providing a (less accurate) cross check. We find $B_K(\\text{NDR}, μ= 2 \\text{GeV}) = 0.529 \\pm 0.009 \\pm 0.032$ and $\\hat{B}_K =B_K(\\text{RGI})= 0.724 \\pm 0.012 \\pm 0.043$, where the first error is statistical and the second systematic. The error is dominated by the truncation error in the matching factor. Our results are consistent with those obtained using valence domain-wall fermions on lattices generated with asqtad or domain-wall sea quarks.",

      "summary": "We explore the sign problem in strongly coupled lattice QED with one flavor of Wilson fermions in four dimensions using the fermion bag formulation. We construct rules to compute the weight of a fermion bag and show that even though the fermions are confined into bosons, fermion bags with negative weights do exist. By classifying fermion bags as either simple or complex, we find numerical evidence that complex bags with positive and negative weights come with almost equal probabilities and this leads to a severe sign problem. On the other hand simple bags mostly have a positive weight. Since the complex bags almost cancel each other, we suggest that eliminating them from the partition function may be a good approximation. This modified partition function suffers only from a mild sign problem. We also find a simpler model which does not suffer from any sign problem and may still be a good approximation at small and intermediate values of the hopping parameter. We also prove that when the hopping parameter is strictly infinite all fermion bags are non-negative.",

      "summary": "We report on the results of numerical simulations of 1+1 dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills theory with maximal supersymmetry at finite temperature and compactified on a circle. For large N this system is thought to provide a dual description of the decoupling limit of N coincident D1-branes on a circle. It has been proposed that at large N there is a phase transition at strong coupling related to the Gregory-Laflamme (GL) phase transition in the holographic gravity dual. In a high temperature limit there was argued to be a deconfinement transition associated to the spatial Polyakov loop, and it has been proposed that this is the continuation of the strong coupling GL transition. Investigating the theory on the lattice for SU(3) and SU(4) and studying the time and space Polyakov loops we find evidence supporting this. In particular at strong coupling we see the transition has the parametric dependence on coupling predicted by gravity. We estimate the GL phase transition temperature from the lattice data which, interestingly, is not yet known directly in the gravity dual. Fine tuning in the lattice theory is avoided by the use of a lattice action with exact supersymmetry.",

      "summary": "The topological susceptibility of the SU(3) random vortex world-surface ensemble, an effective model of infrared Yang-Mills dynamics, is investigated. The model is implemented by composing vortex world-surfaces of elementary squares on a hypercubic lattice, supplemented by an appropriate specification of vortex color structure on the world-surfaces. Topological charge is generated in this picture by writhe and self-intersection of the vortex world-surfaces. Systematic uncertainties in the evaluation of the topological charge, engendered by the hypercubic construction, are discussed. Results for the topological susceptibility are reported as a function of temperature and compared to corresponding measurements in SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills theory. In the confined phase, the topological susceptibility of the random vortex world-surface ensemble appears quantitatively consistent with Yang-Mills theory. As the temperature is raised into the deconfined regime, the topological susceptibility falls off rapidly, but significantly less so than in SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills theory. Possible causes of this deviation, ranging from artefacts of the hypercubic description to more physical sources, such as the adopted vortex dynamics, are discussed.",

      "summary": "We present a new study of D semileptonic decays on the lattice which employs the Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) action for both the charm and the light valence quarks. We work with MILC unquenched $N_f = 2 + 1$ lattices and determine the scalar form factor $f_0(q^2)$ for $D \\rightarrow K, l ν$ semileptonic decays. The form factor is obtained from a scalar current matrix element that does not require any operator matching. We develop a new approach to carrying out chiral/continuum extrapolations of $f_0(q^2)$. The method uses the kinematic \"$z$\" variable instead of $q^2$ or the kaon energy $E_K$ and is applicable over the entire physical $q^2$ range. We find $f^{D \\rightarrow K}_0(0) \\equiv f^{D \\rightarrow K}_+(0) = 0.747(19)$ in the chiral plus continuum limit and hereby improve the theory error on this quantity by a factor of $\\sim$4 compared to previous lattice determinations. Combining the new theory result with recent experimental measurements of the product $f^{D \\rightarrow K}_+(0) * |V_{cs}| $ from BaBar and CLEO-c leads to the most precise direct determination of the CKM matrix element $|V_{cs}| $ to date, $|V_{cs}| = 0.961(11)(24)$, where the first error comes from experiment and the second is the lattice QCD theory error. We calculate the ratio $f^{D \\rightarrow K}_+(0)/f_{D_s}$ and find $2.986 \\pm 0.087$ GeV$^{-1}$ and show that this agrees with experiment.",

      "summary": "We study QCD with 2 and 3 flavours of colour-sextet quarks. The 2-flavour theory is a candidate Walking Technicolor theory. Since we are attempting to distinguish whether this theory is walking or conformal, we also study the 3-flavour theory, which is believed to be conformal, for comparison. We simulate lattice QCD with 2 and 3 flavours of colour-sextet staggered quarks at finite temperatures to determine the scales of confinement and chiral-symmetry breaking from the positions of the deconfinement and chiral-symmetry restoration transitions. Unlike the case with fundamental quarks, these transitions are far apart. For 2 flavours the values of beta=6/g^2 for both transitions increase as Ta is decreased from 1/4 to 1/6 to 1/8, as expected for a theory whose coupling runs to smaller values as the lattice spacing is decreased. However, for the chiral transition, the increase in beta between Ta=1/4 and Ta=1/6 is much larger than the increase between Ta=1/6 and Ta=1/8. This suggests that between Ta=1/4 and Ta=1/6 we are at strong coupling where the theory is effectively quenched, while between Ta=1/6 and Ta=1/8 we are emerging into the weak coupling regime. It will require even smaller Ta values to determine whether the running of the chiral-transition coupling is controlled by asymptotic freedom and the theory walks, or if it reaches a non-zero limit when the transition becomes a bulk transition and the theory is conformal. The 3 flavour case at Ta=1/4 and Ta=1/6 behaves similarly to the 2 flavour case. Since this theory is expected to be conformal, the interpretation that we are seeing strong-coupling behaviour, inaccessible from the weak-coupling limit (continuum) is the most likely interpretation.",

      "summary": "Motivated by the connection between gauge field topology and the axial anomaly in fermion currents, I use the fourth power of the naive Dirac operator to define a local lattice measure of topological charge. For smooth gauge fields this reduces to the usual topological density. For typical gauge field configurations in a numerical simulation, however, quantum fluctuations dominate, and the sum of this density over the system does not generally give an integer winding. On cooling with respect to the Wilson gauge action, instanton like structures do emerge. As cooling proceeds, these objects tend shrink and finally \"fall through the lattice.\" Modifying the action can block the shrinking at the expense of a loss of reflection positivity. The cooling procedure is highly sensitive to the details of the initial steps, suggesting that quantum fluctuations induce a small but fundamental ambiguity in the definition of topological susceptibility.",

We divide the lattice sites into three sectors according to these phases and show that the sectors give rise to the formation of clusters.

In this regime, it is accurate up to order g^6. We also evaluate the Polyakov-loop correlator in an effective field theory framework that takes advantage of the hierarchy of energy scales in the problem and makes explicit the bound-state dynamics. In the effective field theory framework, we show that the Polyakov-loop correlator is at leading order in the multipole expansion the sum of a colour-singlet and a colour-octet quark-antiquark correlator, which are gauge invariant, and compute the corresponding colour-singlet and colour-octet free energies.",

      "summary": "The bottomonium spectrum is computed in dynamical 2+1 flavor lattice QCD, using NRQCD for the b quarks. The main calculations in this work are based on gauge field ensembles generated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations with the Iwasaki action for the gluons and a domain-wall action for the sea quarks. Lattice spacing values of approximately 0.08 fm and 0.11 fm are used, and simultaneous chiral extrapolations to the physical pion mass are performed. As a test for gluon discretization errors, the calculations are repeated on two ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration with the Luscher-Weisz gauge action. Gluon discretization errors are also studied in a lattice potential model using perturbation theory for four different gauge actions. The nonperturbative lattice QCD results for the radial and orbital bottomonium energy splittings obtained from the RBC/UKQCD ensembles are found to be in excellent agreement with experiment. To get accurate results for spin splittings, the spin-dependent order-v^6 terms are included in the NRQCD action, and suitable ratios are calculated such that most of the unknown radiative corrections cancel. The cancellation of radiative corrections is verified explicitly by repeating the calculations with different values of the couplings in the NRQCD action. Using the lattice ratios of the S-wave hyperfine and the 1P tensor splitting, and the experimental result for the 1P tensor splitting, the 1S hyperfine splitting is found to be 60.3+-5.5(stat)+-5.0(syst)+-2.1(exp) MeV, and the 2S hyperfine splitting is predicted to be 23.5+-4.1(stat)+-2.1(syst)+-0.8(exp) MeV.",

Different moments and their ratios as well as skewness and kurtosis are evaluated on the phenomenologically determined freeze-out curve in the temperature, baryon chemical potential plane. The model results and its predictions as well as relations between different moments are compared with the first data on net proton fluctuations in Au-Au collisions obtained at RHIC by the STAR Collaboration.

A Symanzik improved gauge and a stout-link improved staggered fermion action is utilized. We use physical quark masses, that is, for the lightest staggered pions and kaons we fix the $m_π/f_K$ and $m_K/f_K$ ratios to their experimental values. The pressure, the interaction measure, the energy and entropy density and the speed of sound are presented as functions of the temperature in the range $100 ...1000 \\textmd{MeV}$.

We analytically and numerically address the question of center symmetry realization on lattices with $Γ$ sites in each direction in the large-$N$ limit. We show, by a weak coupling calculation that, for massless fermions, center symmetry realization is independent of $Γ$, and is unbroken. Then, we extend our result by conducting simulations at non zero mass and finite gauge coupling. Our results indicate that center symmetry is intact for a range of fermion mass in the vicinity of the critical line on lattices of volume $2^4$. This observation makes it possible to compute infinite volume physical observables using small volume simulations in the limit $N\\to\\infty$, with possible applications to the determination of the conformal window in gauge theories with adjoint fermions.",

Our study is based on the two particular realizations of Borici-Creutz and Karsten-Wilczek. A common feature of both formulations is the breaking of hyper-cubic symmetry, which requires that the lattice actions are supplemented by suitable counterterms. We show that three counterterms are required in each case and determine their coefficients to one loop in perturbation theory. For both actions we compute the vacuum polarization of the gluon. It is shown that no power divergences appear and that all contributions which arise from the breaking of Lorentz symmetry are cancelled by the counterterms. We also derive the conserved vector and axial-vector currents for Karsten-Wilczek fermions. Like in the case of the previously studied Borici-Creutz action, one obtains simple expressions, involving only nearest-neighbour sites. We suggest methods how to fix the coefficients of the counterterms non-perturbatively and discuss the implications of our findings for practical simulations.",

Non-perturbative results are obtained using the twisted mass Wilson fermion formulation employing two degenerate dynamical quarks and the tree-level Symanzik improved gluon action. The simulations have been performed for pion masses in the range of about 450-260 MeV and at three values of the lattice spacing $a$ corresponding to $β=3.9, 4.05, 4.20$. Subtraction of ${\\cal O}(a^2)$ terms is carried out by performing the perturbative evaluation of these operators at 1-loop and up to ${\\cal O}(a^2)$. The renormalization conditions are defined in the RI$'$-MOM scheme, for both perturbative and non-perturbative results. The renormalization factors, obtained for different values of the renormalization scale, are evolved perturbatively to a reference scale set by the inverse of the lattice spacing. In addition, they are translated to ${\\bar{\\rm MS}}$ at 2 GeV using 3-loop perturbative results for the conversion factors.",

      "summary": "We have measured the running coupling constant of SU(3) gauge theory coupled to Nf=2 flavors of symmetric representation fermions, using the Schrodinger functional scheme. Our lattice action is defined with hypercubic smeared links which, along with the larger lattice sizes, bring us closer to the continuum limit than in our previous study. We observe that the coupling runs more slowly than predicted by asymptotic freedom, but we are unable to observe fixed point behavior before encountering a first order transition to a strong coupling phase. This indicates that the infrared fixed point found with the thin-link action is a lattice artifact. The slow running of the gauge coupling permits an accurate determination of the mass anomalous dimension for this theory, which we observe to be small, gamma_m < 0.6, over the range of couplings we can reach. We also study the bulk and finite-temperature phase transitions in the strong coupling region.",

      "summary": "We make use of twisted boundary conditions for off-shell Rome-Southampton renormalisation. This allows to define the vertex function precisely, at a fixed physical momentum that need not be one of the Fourier modes of a simulation. This definition includes choosing the orientation with respect to lattice axes, and so lattice artefacts including ${\\cal O}(4)$ breaking then have a valid Symanzik expansion. Excellent statistical precision is afforded by volume plane-wave sources, enabling both a theoretically and statistically clean continuum limit to be taken. Thereafter all $p^2$ dependence can be unambiguously identified as continuum anomolous running.\n  The use of non-exceptional momenta has been found to greatly reduce the dependence of non-perturbative vertex functions on both mass and $p^2$. We illustrate how this can be developed into a practical scheme for step-scaling the RI/SMOM approach with initial results. The size of the possible steps is continuous, rather than discrete allowing one to take arbitrarily small steps, and the scheme inherits from RI/MOM the property that it is easy to implement for general operators.",

      "summary": "Exact chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacing would preclude the axial anomaly. In order to describe a continuum quantum field theory of Dirac fermions, lattice actions with purported exact chiral symmetry must break the flavor-singlet axial symmetry. We demonstrate that this is indeed the case by using a minimally doubled fermion action. For simplicity we consider the Abelian axial anomaly in two dimensions. At finite lattice spacing and with gauge interactions, the axial anomaly arises from non-conservation of the flavor-singlet current. Similar non-conservation also leads to the axial anomaly in the case of the naive lattice action. For minimally doubled actions, however, fine tuning of the action and axial current is necessary to arrive at the anomaly. Conservation of the flavor non-singlet vector current additionally requires the current to be fine tuned. Finally we determine that the chiral projection of a minimally doubled fermion action can be used to arrive at a lattice theory with an undoubled Dirac fermion possessing the correct anomaly in the continuum limit.",

      "summary": "The overlap fermion propagator is calculated on 2+1 flavor domain wall fermion gauge configurations on 16^3 x 32, 24^3 x 64 and 32^3 x 64 lattices. With HYP smearing and low eigenmode deflation, it is shown that the inversion of the overlap operator can be expedited by ~ 20 times for the 16^3 x 32 lattice and ~ 80 times for the 32^3 x 64 lattice. Through the study of hyperfine splitting, we found that the O(m^2a^2) error is small and these dynamical fermion lattices can adequately accommodate quark mass up to the charm quark. The low energy constant Δ_{mix} which characterizes the discretization error of the pion made up of a pair of sea and valence quarks in this mixed action approach is calculated via the scalar correlator with periodic and anti-periodic boundary conditions. It is found to be small which shifts a 300 MeV pion mass by ~ 10 to 19 MeV on these sets of lattices. We have studied the signal-to-noise issue of the noise source for the meson and baryon. It is found that the many-to-all meson and baryon correlators with Z_3 grid source and low eigenmode substitution is efficient in reducing errors for the correlators of both mesons and baryons. With 64-point Z_3 grid source and low-mode substitution, it can reduce the statistical errors of the light quark (m_π ~ 200 - 300 MeV) meson and nucleon correlators by a factor of ~ 3-4 as compared to the point source. The Z_3 grid source itself can reduce the errors of the charmonium correlators by a factor of ~ 3.",

It has resisted solution until quite recently when new ideas drawn from orbifold constructions and topological field theory have been brought to bear on the question. The result has been the creation of a new class of lattice gauge theory in which the lattice action is invariant under one or more supersymmetries. The resultant theories are local and free of doublers and in the case of Yang-Mills theories also possess exact gauge invariance. In principle they form the basis for a truly non-perturbative definition of the continuum supersymmetric field theory.

We develop a winding number expansion method to accurately project out the particle number from the fermion determinant which greatly extends the applicable range of baryon number sectors to make the study feasible. Our lattice simulation was carried out with the clover fermions and improved gauge action. For a given temperature, we calculate the baryon chemical potential from the canonical approach to look for the mixed phase as a signal for the first order phase transition. In the case of $N_f=4$, we observe an \"S-shape\" structure in the chemical potential-density plane due to the surface tension of the mixed phase in a finite volume which is a signal for the first order phase transition. We use the Maxwell construction to determine the phase boundaries for three temperatures below $T_c$. The intersecting point of the two extrapolated boundaries turns out to be at the expected first order transition point at $T_c$ with $μ= 0$. This serves as a check for our method of identifying the critical point. We also studied the $N_f =2$ case, but do not see a signal of the mixed phase for temperature as low as 0.83 $T_c$.",

We extend our previous two studies [Phys. Lett. B643 (2006) 46, JHEP 0906:088 (2009)] by choosing even finer lattices ($N_t$=16) and we work again with physical quark masses. The new results on this broad cross-over are in complete agreement with our earlier ones. We compare our findings with the published results of the hotQCD collaboration. All these results are confronted with the predictions of the Hadron Resonance Gas model and Chiral Perturbation Theory for temperatures below the transition region. Our results can be reproduced by using the physical spectrum in these analytic calculations. The findings of the hotQCD collaboration can be recovered by using a distorted spectrum which takes into account lattice discretization artifacts and heavier than physical quark masses. This analysis provides a simple explanation for the observed discrepancy in the transition temperatures between our and the hotQCD collaborations.",

We confirm previous findings by other authors that at one loop there is no renormalization of the superpotential in the lattice theory, but that there is a mismatch in the wavefunction renormalization of the auxiliary field. We study the range of the Dirac operator that results when the auxiliary fermion is integrated out, and show that localization does occur, but that it is less pronounced than the exponential localization of the overlap operator. We also present preliminary simulation results for this model, and outline a strategy for nonperturbative improvement of the lattice supercurrent through measurements of supersymmetry Ward identities. Related to this, some benchmarks for our graphics processing unit code are provided. Our simulation results find a nearly vanishing vacuum expectation value for the auxiliary field, consistent with approximate supersymmetry at weak coupling.",

      "summary": "We propose new methods to extend the renormalization group transformation to complex coupling spaces. We argue that the Fisher's  zeros are located at the boundary of the complex basin of attraction of infra-red fixed points.  We support this picture with numerical calculations at finite volume for two-dimensional O(N) models in the large-N limit and the hierarchical Ising model. We present numerical evidence that, as the volume increases,  the Fisher's zeros of 4-dimensional pure gauge SU(2) lattice gauge theory with a Wilson action, stabilize at a distance larger than 0.15 from the real axis in the complex beta=4/g^2 plane. We discuss the implications for proofs of confinement and searches for nontrivial infra-red fixed points in models beyond the standard model.",

In particular we address the puzzle raised in a previous work of our group [Phys.\\ Rev.\\ D 77, 14515 (2008)], where we found a violation of the lattice index theorem with the overlap Dirac operator in the fundamental representation even for \"admissible\" gauge fields. Here we confirm the discrepancy between the topological charge and the index of the Dirac operator also for asqtad staggered fermions and the adjoint representation. Numerically, the discrepancy equals the sum of the winding numbers of the spheres when they are regarded as maps $\\mathbbm R^3 \\cup \\{\\infty\\} \\to SU(2)$. Furthermore we find some evidence for fractional topological charge during cooling the spherical center vortex on a $40^3 \\times 2$ lattice. The object with topological charge $Q=1/2$ we identify as a Dirac monopole with a gauge field fading away at large distances. Therefore even for periodic boundary conditions it does not need an antimonopole.",

These calculations could give important theoretical input to experiments, such as those of JLab's 12-GeV program and studies of nucleon deformation. There is an extensive history of form-factor calculations on the lattice, primarily with ground states for both the initial and final state. However, determining form factors at large momentum transfer ($Q^2$) has been difficult due to large statistical and systematic errors in this regime. We study the nucleon form factors using three pion masses with both quenched and 2+1-flavor anisotropic lattice configurations with $Q^2$ as large as $6 GeV^2$. These form factors are further processed to obtain transverse charge and magnetization densities across 2-dimensional impact-parameter space. Our approach can be applied to isotropic lattices and lattices with smaller lattice spacing to calculate even larger-$Q^2$ form factors.",

We employ the variational method with a large basis of interpolating operators enabling six energies in each irreducible representation of the lattice to be distinguished clearly.

Excited states, states with exotic quantum numbers (0+-, 1-+ and 2+-) and states of high spin are resolved, including, for the first time in a lattice QCD calculation, spin-four states.

Our results are also relevant for the corresponding standard (un-twisted) Wilson fermionic action since the two actions only differ, in the massless limit, by a chiral rotation of the quark fields. The scale-independent renormalization constants ZV, ZA and the ratio ZP/ZS have been computed using the RI-MOM approach, as well as other alternative methods. For ZA and ZP/ZS, the latter are based on both standard twisted mass and Osterwalder-Seiler fermions, while for ZV a Ward Identity has been used. The quark field renormalization constant Zq and the scale dependent renormalization constants ZS, ZP and ZT are determined in the RI-MOM scheme. Leading discretization effects of O(g^2 a^2), evaluated in one-loop perturbation theory, are explicitly subtracted from the RI-MOM estimates.",

I use the 2-lattice matching  Monte Carlo renormalization group method  to study the fixed point structure and critical indexes of SU(3) gauge models with 8 and 12 flavors  of fundamental fermions.  With an improved renormalization group block transformation I am able to connect the perturbative and  confining regimes of the  N_f=8 flavor system, thus verifying its QCD-like nature. With N_f=12 flavors the data favor the existence of an infrared fixed point and conformal phase, though the results  are  also consistent with very slow walking.   I measure the anomalous mass dimension in both systems at several gauge couplings and find  that they are barely different from the free field value.",

Results are based on calculations with lattice spacings approximately 0.15, 0.12 and 0.09 fm, using four flavors of dynamical HISQ quarks. The strange and charm quark masses are near their physical values, and the light-quark mass is set to 0.2 times the strange-quark mass. We look at the lattice spacing dependence of hadron masses, pseudoscalar meson decay constants, and the topological susceptibility. In addition to the commonly used determination of the lattice spacing through the static quark potential, we examine a determination proposed by the HPQCD collaboration that uses the decay constant of a fictitious \"unmixed s bar s\" pseudoscalar meson. We find that the lattice artifacts in the HISQ simulations are much smaller than those in the asqtad simulations at the same lattice spacings and quark masses.",

      "summary": "Chiral perturbation theory predicts that in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), light dynamical quarks suppress the gauge-field topological susceptibility of the vacuum. The degree of suppression depends on quark multiplicity and masses. It provides a strong consistency test for fermion formulations in lattice QCD. Such tests are especially important for staggered fermion formulations that lack a full chiral symmetry and use the \"fourth-root\" procedure to achieve the desired number of sea quarks. Over the past few years we have measured the topological susceptibility on a large database of 18 gauge field ensembles, generated in the presence of 2+1 flavors of dynamical asqtad quarks with up and down quark masses ranging from 0.05 to 1 in units of the strange quark mass and lattice spacings ranging from 0.045 fm to 0.12 fm. Our study also includes three quenched ensembles with lattice spacings ranging from 0.06 to 0.12 fm. We construct the topological susceptibility from the integrated point-to-point correlator of the discretized topological charge density F-Fdual. To reduce its variance, we model the asymptotic tail of the correlator. The continuum extrapolation of our results for the topological susceptibility agrees nicely at small quark mass with the predictions of lowest-order SU(3) chiral perturbation theory, thus lending support to the validity of the fourth-root procedure.",

The theory also contains a set of topological observables corresponding to Wilson loops wrapping non-trivial cycles of the base manifold. This moduli space and set of topological observables is shared with the Chern Simons formulation of three dimensional gravity and we hence conjecture that the Yang-Mills theory gives an equivalent description of the gravitational theory.

The calculations are carried out with gauge configurations generated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations with (2+1)-flavors of dynamical domain wall fermions and the Iwasaki gauge action ($β= 2.13$). The inverse lattice spacing is $a^{-1} = 1.73$ GeV, and two spatial volumes of ((2.7{\\rm fm})^3) and ((1.8 {\\rm fm})^3) are used. The up and down quark masses are varied so the pion mass lies between 0.33 and 0.67 GeV while the strange mass is about 12 % heavier than the physical one. The structure function moments we present include fully non-perturbatively renormalized  iso-vector quark momentum fraction, (< x >_{u-d}), helicity fraction, (< x >_{Δu - Δd}), and transversity, (< 1 >_{δu - δd}),  as well as an unrenormalized twist-3 coefficient, (d_1). The ratio of the momentum to helicity fractions, (< x >_{u-d}/< x >_{Δu - Δd}), does not show dependence on the light quark mass and agrees well with the value obtained from experiment. Their respective absolute values, fully renormalized, show interesting trends toward their respective experimental values at the lightest quark mass. A prediction for the transversity, (0.7 < < 1 >_{δu -δd} < 1.1), in the (\\bar{\\rm MS}) scheme at 2 GeV is obtained. The twist-3 coefficient, (d_1), though yet to be renormalized, supports the perturbative Wandzura-Wilczek relation.",

One way to achieve this is to enlarge $L_s$, the size of fifth dimension, which controls the size of the induced chiral symmetry breaking. While this is a type of reweighting method for shifting the action parameter, it seems non-trivial since this reweighting means change of the five dimensional lattice volume. In this report, we address issues in this direction of reweighting and evaluate its effectiveness.",

This requires the computation of the masses of Ds^(*) and Bs^(*) mesons comprised of a Fermilab heavy quark and a staggered light quark. Additionally, we report the hyperfine splittings for Ds and Bs mesons as a cross-check of our simulation and analysis methods. We find a splitting of 145 +/- 15 MeV for the Ds system and 40 +/- 9 MeV for the Bs system. These are in good agreement with the Particle Data Group average values of 143.9 +/- 0.4 MeV and 46.1 +/- 1.5 MeV, respectively.

We simulate lattice QCD with 2 flavours of sextet staggered quarks to determine whether walks, or if it has an infrared fixed point, making it a conformal field theory. Our initial simulations are performed at finite temperatures $T=1/N_ta$ ($N_t=4$ and $N_t=6$), which allows us to identify the scales of confinement and chiral-symmetry breaking from the deconfinement and chiral-symmetry restoring transitions. Unlike QCD with fundamental quarks, these two transitions appear to be well-separated. The change in coupling constants at these transitions between the two different temporal extents $N_t$, is consistent with these being finite temperature transitions for an asymptotically free theory, which favours walking behaviour. In the deconfined phase, the Wilson Line shows a 3-state signal. Between the confinement and chiral transitions, there is an additional transition where the states with Wilson Lines oriented in the directions of the complex cube roots of unity disorder into a state with a negative Wilson Line.",

      "summary": "QCD with two flavours of massless colour-sextet quarks is considered as a model for conformal/walking Technicolor. If this theory possess an infrared fixed point, as indicated by 2-loop perturbation theory, it is a conformal(unparticle) field theory. If, on the other hand, a chiral condensate forms on the weak-coupling side of this would-be fixed point, the theory remains confining. The only difference between such a theory and regular QCD is that there is a range of momentum scales over which the coupling constant runs very slowly (walks). In this first analysis, we simulate the lattice version of QCD with two flavours of staggered quarks at finite temperatures on lattices of temporal extent $N_t=4$ and 6. The deconfinement and chiral-symmetry restoration couplings give us a measure of the scales associated with confinement and chiral-symmetry breaking. We find that, in contrast to what is seen with fundamental quarks, these transition couplings are very different. $β=6/g^2$ for each of these transitions increases significantly from $N_t=4$ and $N_t=6$ as expected for the finite temperature transitions of an asymptotically-free theory. This suggests a walking rather than a conformal behaviour, in contrast to what is observed with Wilson quarks. In contrast to what is found for fundamental quarks, the deconfined phase exhibits states in which the Polyakov loop is oriented in the directions of all three cube roots of unity. At very weak coupling the states with complex Polyakov loops undergo a transition to a state with a real, negative Polyakov loop.",

By generalizing the procedure already introduced for the untwisted Wilson chiral effective theory, we extend the continuum chiral epsilon expansion to twisted mass WChPT. We define different regimes, depending on the relative power counting for the quark masses and the lattice spacing. We explicitly compute, for arbitrary twist angle, the leading O(a^2) corrections appearing at NLO in the so-called GSM^* regime. As in untwisted WChPT, we find that in this situation the impact of explicit chiral symmetry breaking due to lattice artefacts is strongly suppressed. Of particular interest is the case of maximal twist, which corresponds to the setup usually adopted in lattice simulations with twisted mass Wilson fermions. The formulae we obtain can be matched to lattice data to extract physical low energy couplings, and to estimate systematic uncertainties coming from discretization errors.",

      "summary": "In the presence of a chemical potential, the physics of level crossings leads to singularities at zero temperature, even when the spatial volume is finite. These singularities are smoothed out at a finite temperature but leave behind non-trivial finite size effects which must be understood in order to extract thermodynamic quantities using Monte Carlo methods, particularly close to critical points. We illustrate some of these issues using the classical non-linear O(2) sigma model with a coupling $β$ and chemical potential $μ$ on a 2+1 dimensional Euclidean lattice. In the conventional formulation this model suffers from a sign problem at non-zero chemical potential and hence cannot be studied with the Wolff cluster algorithm. However, when formulated in terms of world-line of particles, the sign problem is absent and the model can be studied efficiently with the \"worm algorithm\". Using this method we study the finite size effects that arise due to the chemical potential and develop an effective quantum mechanical approach to capture the effects. As a side result we obtain energy levels of up to four particles as a function of the box size and uncover a part of the phase diagram in the $(β,μ)$ plane.",

Recently, systems with up to 12 $π^+$'s or $K^+$'s have been studied to determine the 3-$π^+$ and 3-$K^+$ interactions, and the corresponding chemical potentials have been determined as a function of density. We derive recursion relations between correlation functions that allow this work to be extended to systems of arbitrary numbers of mesons and to systems containing many different types of mesons, such as $π^+$'s, $K^+$'s, $\\bar{D}^0$'s and $B^+$'s.

      "summary": "We demonstrate a method for calculating the neutral B-meson decay constants and mixing matrix elements in unquenched lattice QCD with domain-wall light quarks and static b-quarks. Our computation is performed on the \"2+1\" flavor gauge configurations generated by the RBC and UKQCD Collaborations with a lattice spacing of a approx 0.11 fm (a^-1 = 1.729 GeV) and a lattice spatial volume of approximately (1.8 fm)^3. We simulate at three different light sea quark masses with pion masses down to approximately 430 MeV, and extrapolate to the physical quark masses using a phenomenologically-motivated fit function based on next-to-leading order heavy-light meson SU(2) chiral perturbation theory. For the b-quarks, we use an improved formulation of the Eichten-Hill action with static link-smearing to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We also improve the heavy-light axial current used to compute the B-meson decay constant to O(alpha_s p a) using one-loop lattice perturbation theory. We present initial results for the SU(3)-breaking ratios f_{B_s}/f_{B_d} and xi = f_{B_s} sqrt{B_{B_s}}/f_{B_d} sqrt{B_{B_d}}, thereby demonstrating the viability of the method. For the ratio of decay constants, we find f_{B_s}/f_{B_d} = 1.15(12) and for the ratio of mixing matrix elements, we find xi = 1.13(12), where in both cases the errors reflect the combined statistical and systematic uncertainties, including an estimate of the size of neglected O(1/m_b) effects.",

      "summary": "We calculate the corrections to the amputated Green's functions of 4-fermion operators, in 1-loop Lattice Perturbation theory. The novel aspect of our calculations is that they are carried out to second order in the lattice spacing, O(a^2). We employ the Wilson/clover action for massless fermions (also applicable for the twisted mass action in the chiral limit) and the Symanzik improved action for gluons. Our calculations have been carried out in a general covariant gauge. Results have been obtained for several popular choices of values for the Symanzik coefficients (Plaquette, Tree-level Symanzik, Iwasaki, TILW and DBW2 action). We pay particular attention to $ΔF=2$ operators, both Parity Conserving and Parity Violating ($F$ stands for flavour: S, C, B). We study the mixing pattern of these operators, to O(a^2), using the appropriate projectors. Our results for the corresponding renormalization matrices are given as a function of a large number of parameters: coupling constant, clover parameter, number of colors, lattice spacing, external momentum and gauge parameter. The O(a^2) correction terms (along with our previous O(a^2) calculation of $Z_Ψ$) are essential ingredients for minimizing the lattice artifacts which are present in non-perturbative evaluations of renormalization constants with the RI'-MOM method.

As the magnetic moments of baryons affect their relativistic propagation in constant electric fields, electric polarizabilities cannot be determined without knowledge of magnetic moments. This is analogous to the experimental situation, for which determination of polarizabilities from the Compton amplitude requires subtraction of Born terms. With the background field method, we devise combinations of nucleon correlation functions in constant electric fields that isolate magnetic moments and electric polarizabilities. Using an ensemble of anisotropic gauge configurations with dynamical clover fermions, we demonstrate how both observables can be determined from lattice QCD simulations in background electric fields. We obtain results for the neutron and proton, however, our study is currently limited to electrically neutral sea quarks. The value we extract for the nucleon isovector magnetic moment is comparable to those obtained from measuring lattice three-point functions at similar pion masses.",
