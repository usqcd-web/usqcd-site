      "title": "Lattice Hadron Structure: Applications within and beyond QCD",
      "summary": "Study of the hadronic matrix elements can provide not only tests of the QCD sector of the Standard Model (in comparing with existing experiments) but also reliable low-energy hadronic quantities applicable to a wide range of beyond-the-Standard Model scenarios where experiments or theoretical calculations are limited or difficult. On the QCD side, progress has been made in the notoriously difficult problem of addressing gluonic structure inside the nucleon, reaching higher-$Q^2$ region of the form factors, and providing a complete picture of the proton spin. However, even further study and improvement of systematic uncertainties are needed. There are also proposed calculations of higher-order operators in the neutron electric dipole moment Lagrangian, which would be useful when combined with effective theory to probe BSM. Lattice isovector tensor and scalar charges can be combined with upcoming neutron beta-decay measurements of the Fierz interference term and neutrino asymmetry parameter to probe new interactions in the effective theory, revealing the scale of potential new TeV particles. Finally, I revisit the systematic uncertainties in recent calculations of $g_A$ and review prospects for future calculations.",

      "summary": "Lattice radial quantization is introduced as a nonperturbative method intended to numerically solve Euclidean conformal field theories that can be realized as fixed points of known Lagrangians. As an example, we employ a lattice shaped as a cylinder with a 2D Icosahedral cross-section to discretize dilatations in the 3D Ising model. Using this method, we obtain the preliminary estimate eta=0.034(10).",

      "summary": "We demonstrate the new class of variance reduction techniques for hadron propagator and nucleon isovector form factor in the realistic lattice of $N_f=2+1$ domain-wall fermion. All-mode averaging (AMA) is one of the powerful tools to reduce the statistical noise effectively for wider varieties of observables compared to existing techniques such as low-mode averaging (LMA). We adopt this technique to hadron two-point functions and three-point functions, and compare with LMA and traditional source-shift method in the same ensembles. We observe AMA is much more cost effective in reducing statistical error for these observables.",

This work is a more extended analysis than our recent publication of the SU(3)-breaking ratio xi [arXiv:1205.7013]. We use the asqtad staggered action for light valence quarks in combination with the Fermilab interpretation of the Sheikoleslami-Wohlert action for heavy quarks. The calculations use MILC's 2+1 flavor asqtad ensembles. Ensembles include four lattice spacings from approximately 0.125 fm to 0.045 fm and up/down to strange quark mass ratios as low as 0.05. Our calculation covers the complete set of five operators needed to describe B mixing in the Standard Model and beyond. In addition to an update including a fuller set of analyzed data, we comment on the form of the staggered ChPT extrapolation function.",

      "summary": "Excited state spectra are calculated using lattice QCD for baryons that can be formed from $u$, $d$ and $s$ quarks, namely the $N$, $Δ$, $Λ$, $Σ$, $Ξ$ and $Ω$ families of baryons. Baryonic operators are constructed from continuum operators that transform as irreducible representations of SU(3)$_F$ symmetry for flavor, SU(4) symmetry for Dirac spins of quarks and O(3) symmetry for orbital angular momenta. Covariant derivatives are used to realize orbital angular momenta. Using the operators, we calculate matrices of correlation functions in order to extract excited states. The resulting lattice spectra have bands of baryonic states with well-defined total spins up to $J=7/2$. Each state can be assigned a dominant flavor symmetry and the counting of states of each flavor and spin reflects $SU(6) \\times O(3)$ symmetry for the lowest negative-parity and positive-parity bands. States with strong hybrid content are identified through the dominance of chromo-magnetic operators.",

      "summary": "Using staggered fermions and twisted boundary conditions, we calculate the K meson semileptonic decay vector form factor at zero momentum transfer. The HISQ formulation is used for the valence quarks, while the sea quarks are simulated with the asqtad action (MILC N_f=2+1 configurations). For the chiral and continuum extrapolation we use two-loop continuum CHPT, supplemented by partially quenched staggered CHPT at one loop. Our result is f_+^{Kπ}(0) = 0.9667+-0.0023+-0.0033, where the first error is statistical and the second is the sum in quadrature of the systematic uncertainties. This result is the first N_f=2+1 calculation with two lattice spacings and a controlled continuum extrapolation. It is also the most precise result to date for the vector form factor and, although the central value is larger than previous unquenched lattice calculations, it is compatible with them within errors. Combining our value for f_+^{Kπ}(0) with the latest experimental measurements of K semileptonic decays, we obtain |V_{us}| = 0.2238+-0.0009+-0.0005, where the first error is from f_+^{Kπ}(0) and the second one is experimental. As a byproduct of our calculation, we obtain the combination of low-energy constants [C_{12}^r+C_{34}^r-(L_5^r)^2](M_ρ) = (3.62+-1.00)x10^{-6}.",

      "summary": "We present a quantization condition for the spectrum of a system composed of three identical bosons in a finite volume with periodic boundary conditions. This condition gives a relation between the finite volume spectrum and infinite volume scattering amplitudes. The quantization condition presented is an integral equation that in general must be solved numerically. However, for systems with an attractive two-body force that supports a two-body bound-state, a diboson, and for energies below the diboson breakup, the quantization condition reduces to the well-known Luscher formula with exponential corrections in volume that scale with the diboson binding momentum. To accurately determine infinite volume phase shifts, it is necessary to extrapolate the phase shifts obtained from the Luscher formula for the boson-diboson system to the infinite volume limit. For energies above the breakup threshold, or for systems with no two-body bound-state (with only scattering states and resonances) the Luscher formula gets power-law volume corrections and consequently fails to describe the three-particle system. These corrections are nonperturbatively included in the quantization condition presented.",

The result from the ensemble with m_π= 250 MeV pion mass, corresponding to the finite-size scaling parameter m_πL \\sim 5.8, agrees well with an earlier result at a^{-1}=1.7 GeV, L = 2.8 fm, and m_π= 420 MeV, with similar m_πL. This suggests the systematic error from excited-state contamination is small in both ensembles and about 10-% deficit in g_A we are observing is likely a finite-size effect that scales with m_πL. We also report the result from the lighter, m_π= 170 MeV ensemble.",

      "summary": "There has been much speculation as to the origin of the ΔI = 1/2 rule (Re A_0/Re A_2 \\simeq 22.5). We find that the two dominant contributions to the ΔI=3/2, K \\to ππ correlation functions have opposite signs leading to a significant cancellation. This partial cancellation occurs in our computation of Re A_2 with physical quark masses and kinematics (where we reproduce the experimental value of A_2) and also for heavier pions at threshold. For Re A_0, although we do not have results at physical kinematics, we do have results for pions at zero-momentum with m_π \\simeq 420 MeV (Re A_0/Re A_2=9.1(2.1)) and m_π \\simeq 330 MeV (Re A_0/Re A_2=12.0(1.7)). The contributions which partially cancel in Re A_2 are also the largest ones in Re A_0, but now they have the same sign and so enhance this amplitude. The emerging explanation of the ΔI=1/2 rule is a combination of the perturbative running to scales of O(2 GeV), a relative suppression of Re A_2 through the cancellation of the two dominant contributions and the corresponding enhancement of Re A_0. QCD and EWP penguin operators make only very small contributions at such scales.",

We observe a rapidly rising phase shift that can be well described by a single ρ resonance. The spectrum is obtained from hadron correlators computed using lattice QCD with light quark masses corresponding to mπ ~ 400 MeV. Variational analyses are performed with large bases of hadron interpolating fields including, as well as fermion bilinears that resemble q-qbar constructions, also operators that resemble pairs of pions with definite relative and total momentum. We compute the spectrum for a range of center-of-mass momenta and in various irreducible representations of the relevant symmetry group. Hence we determine more than thirty values of the isospin-1 P-wave scattering phase shift in the elastic region, mapping out its energy dependence in unprecedented detail.",

      "summary": "Over the past years GPUs have been successfully applied to the task of inverting the fermion matrix in lattice QCD calculations. Even strong scaling to capability-level supercomputers, corresponding to O(100) GPUs or more has been achieved. However strong scaling a whole gauge field generation algorithm to this regim requires significantly more functionality than just having the matrix inverter utilizing the GPUs and has not yet been accomplished. This contribution extends QDP-JIT, the migration of SciDAC QDP++ to GPU-enabled parallel systems, to help to strong scale the whole Hybrid Monte-Carlo to this regime. Initial results are shown for gauge field generation with Chroma simulating pure Wilson fermions on OLCF TitanDev.",

Simulations are performed using DD-HMC algorithm at two lattice spacings and two volumes for several values of the quark mass.

We make use of the least-squares fit including the full covariance matrix of the correlators and including Gaussian constraints on some parameters. We fit the correlators on a variety of the HISQ ensembles. The lattice spacing ranges from 0.15 fm down to 0.06 fm. The light sea quark mass ranges from 0.2 times the strange quark mass down to the physical light quark mass. The HISQ ensembles also include lattices with different volumes and with unphysical values of the strange quark mass. We use the results from this work to obtain our preliminary results of $f_D$, $f_{D_s}$, $f_{D_s}/f_{D}$, and ratios of quark masses presented in another talk [1].",

We perform simulations on a single-site lattice for Nf = 1 and Nf = 2 Wilson Dirac fermions with values of N up to 53. We show for both values of Nf that in the large-N limit there is a finite region, containing both light and heavy fermions, of unbroken center symmetry where the theory exhibits volume independence. Using large-N reduction we attempt to calculate physical quantities such as the string tension and meson masses.",

Traditional MCRG two-lattice matching requires that the renormalization scheme be optimized for each bare lattice coupling, so that s_b is a composite of many different discrete beta functions. We propose an improved procedure that uses the Wilson flow to eliminate the need for this optimization of the RG blocking transformation. While our 12-flavor results indicate an infrared fixed point, s_b for N_f=8 is significantly different from zero until strong-coupling lattice artifacts obstruct two-lattice matching. Although both procedures produce qualitatively similar bare step-scaling functions, the new s_b obtained by combining the Wilson flow with MCRG two-lattice matching have the distinct advantage of corresponding to unique discrete beta functions.",

Configurations are generated with DDHMC algorithm and smoothed with HYP smearing. In order to shed light on the mechanisms leading to the observed suppression of topological susceptibility with respect to the decreasing quark mass and decreasing volume, in this work, we carry out a detailed study of the two-point TCDC. We have shown that, (1) the TCDC is negative beyond a positive core and radius of the core shrinks as lattice spacing decreases, (2) as the volume decreases, the magnitude of the contact term and the radius of the positive core decrease and the magnitude of the negative peak increases resulting in the suppression of the topological susceptibility as the volume decreases, (3) the contact term and radius of the positive core decrease with decreasing quark mass at a given lattice spacing and the negative peak increases with decreasing quark mass resulting in the suppression of the topological susceptibility with decreasing quark mass, (4) increasing levels of smearing suppresses the contact term and the negative peak keeping the susceptibility intact and (5) both the contact term and the negative peak diverge in nonintegrable fashion as lattice spacing decreases.",

      "title": "On the decoupling of mirror fermions",
      "summary": "An approach to the formulation of chiral gauge theories on the lattice is to start with a vector-like theory, but decouple one chirality (the \"mirror\" fermions) using strong Yukawa interactions with a chirally coupled \"Higgs\" field. While this is an attractive idea, its viability needs to be tested with nonperturbative studies. The model that we study here, the so-called \"3-4-5\" model, is anomaly free and the presence of massless states in the mirror sector is not required by anomaly matching arguments, in contrast to the \"1-0\" model that was studied previously. We have computed the polarization tensor in this theory and find a directional discontinuity that appears to be nonzero in the limit of an infinite lattice, which is equivalent to the continuum limit at fixed physical volume. We show that a similar behavior occurs for the free massless Ginsparg-Wilson fermion, where the polarization tensor is known to have a directional discontinuity in the continuum limit. We thus find support for the conclusion that in the continuum limit of the 3-4-5 model, there are massless charged modes in the mirror sector so that it does not decouple from the light sector. The value of the discontinuity we obtain allows for two interpretations: either a chiral gauge theory does not emerge and mirror-sector fermions in a chiral anomaly free representation remain massless, or a massless vectorlike mirror fermion appears. We end by discussing some questions for future study.",

Information of the phase structure of many-flavor SU(3) gauge theory is of great interest, since the gauge theories with the walking behavior near the infrared fixed point are candidates of new physics for the origin of the dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking. We study the SU(3) gauge theories with 12 and 16 fundamental fermions. Utilizing the HISQ type action which is useful to study the continuum physics, we analyze the lattice data of the mass and the decay constant of the pseudoscalar meson and the mass of the vector meson as well at several values of lattice spacing and fermion mass. The finite size scaling test in the conformal hypothesis is also performed. Our data is consistent with the conformal scenario for Nf=12. We obtain the mass anomalous dimension $γ_m \\sim 0.4-0.5$. An update of $N_f=16$ study is also shown.",

      "summary": "We determine the strange quark condensate from lattice QCD for the first time and compare its value to that of the light quark and chiral condensates. The results come from a direct calculation of the expectation value of the trace of the quark propagator followed by subtraction of the appropriate perturbative contribution, derived here, to convert the non-normal-ordered $m\\barψψ$ to the $\\bar{MS}$ scheme at a fixed scale. This is then a well-defined physical `nonperturbative' condensate that can be used in the Operator Product Expansion of current-current correlators. The perturbative subtraction is calculated through $\\mathcal{O}(α_s)$ and estimates of higher order terms are included through fitting results at multiple lattice spacing values. The gluon field configurations used are `second generation' ensembles from the MILC collaboration that include 2+1+1 flavors of sea quarks implemented with the Highly Improved Staggered Quark action and including $u/d$ sea quarks down to physical masses. Our results are : $<\\bar{s}{s}>^{\\bar{MS}}(2 \\mathrm{GeV})= -(290(15) \\mathrm{MeV})^3$, $<\\bar{l}{l}>^{\\bar{MS}}(2\\, \\mathrm{GeV})= -(283(2) \\mathrm{MeV})^3$, where $l$ is a light quark with mass equal to the average of the $u$ and $d$ quarks. The strange to light quark condensate ratio is 1.08(16). The light quark condensate is significantly larger than the chiral condensate in line with expectations from chiral analyses. We discuss the implications of these results for other calculations.",

As with other reweighting studies, the chief difficulty lies in the construction of a stochastic estimate of the ratio of the fermion determinants. In contrast to the case of reweighting in the quark mass, these estimators converge extremely slowly, and are resistant to common variance-reduction techniques such as low-mode subtraction. However, it is possible to construct an alternate estimator, taking advantage of the fact that we are interested in only perturbatively small fields; this estimator is susceptible to a variance-reduction technique based on a hopping parameter expansion.",

      "summary": "Extended simulation results and their analysis are reported in a strongly coupled gauge theory with twelve fermion flavors in the fundamental SU(3) color representation. The conformality of the model is probed using mass deformed conformal finite size scaling (FSS) theory driven by the fermion mass anomalous dimension. Two independent conformal FSS fitting procedures are used in the analysis. The first one deploys physics motivated scaling functions, complemented by a second fitting procedure with spline based general B-forms for the scaling functions. The results at fixed gauge coupling show unresolved problems with the conformal hypothesis.",

      "summary": "The versatile technology of cold atoms confined in optical lattices allows the creation of a vast number of lattice geometries and interactions, providing a promising platform for emulating various lattice models. This opens the possibility of letting nature take care of sign problems and real time evolution in carefully prepared situations. Up to now, experimentalists have succeeded to implement several types of Hubbard models considered by condensed matter theorists. In this proceeding, we discuss the possibility of extending this effort to lattice gauge theory. We report recent efforts to establish the strong coupling equivalence between the Fermi Hubbard model and SU(2) pure gauge theory in 2+1 dimensions by standard determinantal methods developed by Robert Sugar and collaborators. We discuss the possibility of using dipolar molecules and external fields to build models where the equivalence holds beyond the leading order in the strong coupling expansion.",

      "summary": "It has recently been found that dynamics of pure glue QCD supports the low energy band of Dirac modes with local chiral properties qualitatively different from that of a bulk: while bulk modes suppress chirality relative to statistical independence between left and right, the band modes enhance it. The width of such chirally polarized zone - chiral polarization scale Lambda_ch - has been shown to be finite in the continuum limit at fixed physical volume. Here we present evidence that Lambda_ch remains non-zero also in the infinite volume, and is therefore a dynamical scale in the theory. Our experiments in N_f=2+1 QCD support the proposition that the same holds in the massless limit, connecting Lambda_ch to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. In addition, our results suggest that thermal agitation in quenched QCD destroys both chiral polarization and condensation of Dirac modes at the same temperature T_ch > T_c.",

We show that in the two-state approximation, their transformation can be handled analytically yielding a value 0.964 for the critical exponent nu much closer to the exact value 1 than 1.338 obtained in the Migdal-Kadanoff approximation. We propose two alternative blocking procedures that preserve the isotropy and improve the accuracy to nu=0.987 and 0.993 respectively. We discuss applications to other classical lattice models, including models with fermions, and suggest that it could become a competitor for Monte Carlo methods suitable to calculate accurately critical exponents, take continuum limits and study near-conformal systems in arbitrarily large volumes.",

Pairs of physical flavors are implemented using the two tastes present in a reduced staggered fermion formulation of the theory with the Yukawa interactions necessary for generating the four fermion term preserving the usual shift symmetries. We observe a crossover in the behavior of the chiral condensate for strong four fermi coupling associated with the generation of a dynamical mass for the fermions. At weak gauge coupling this crossover is consistent with the usual continuous phase transition seen in the pure (ungauged) NJL model. However, if the gauge coupling is strong enough to cause confinement we observe a much more rapid crossover in the chiral condensate consistent with a first order phase transition.",

      "summary": "We calculate the energies of quarkonium bound states in the presence of a medium of nonzero isospin density using lattice QCD. The medium, created using a canonical (fixed isospin charge) approach, induces a reduction of the quarkonium energies. As the isospin density increases, the energy shifts first increase and then saturate. The saturation occurs at an isospin density close to that where previously a qualitative change in the behaviour of the energy density of the medium has been observed, which was conjectured to correspond to a transition from a pion gas to a Bose-Einstein condensed phase. The reduction of the quarkonium energies becomes more pronounced as the heavy-quark mass is decreased, similar to the behaviour seen in two-colour QCD at non-zero quark chemical potential. In the process of our analysis, the $η_b$-$π$ and $Υ$-$π$ scattering phase shifts are determined at low momentum. An interpolation of the scattering lengths to the physical pion mass gives $a_{η_b,π} = 0.0025(8)(6)$ fm and $a_{Υ,π} = 0.0030(9)(7)$ fm.",

This study includes five lattice spacings, 0.15, 0.12, 0.09, 0.06, and 0.045 fm, with two sets of degenerate up- and down-quark masses for most spacings. We use an enlarged set of interpolation operators and a variational analysis that permits study of various low-lying excited states. The masses of the sea quarks and charm valence quark are adjusted to their physical values. This large set of gauge configurations allows us to extrapolate results to the continuum physical point and test the methodology.",

We use the Fermilab interpretation of the clover action for heavy valence quarks and the asqtad action for the light valence quarks. The central goal of the program is to provide ever more exacting tests of the unitarity of the CKM matrix. We present preliminary results for one part of the program, namely the analysis of the semileptonic decay B -> D l nu at nonzero recoil.",

This SIMD programming allows parallel processing by multiple cores in a single CPU. Basic arithmetic and data transfer operations such as sum, multiplication and square root can be processed simultaneously. Although popular compilers such as GNU compilers and Intel compilers provide automatic SIMD optimization options, one can obtain better performance by a manual SIMD programming with proper optimization: data packing, data reuse and asynchronous data transfer. In particular, linear algebraic operations of vectors and matrices can be easily optimized by the SIMD programming. Typical calculations in lattice gauge theory are composed of linear algebraic operations of gauge link matrices and fermion vectors, and so can adopt the manual SIMD programming to improve the performance.",

The neutral kaon system is one of the most precise channels to test how the SM theory describes the experiment data such as $ε_K$ accurately. The indirect CP violation is parametrized into $ε_{K}$, which can be calculated directly using lattice QCD. In this calculation, the largest uncertainty comes from two sources: one is $\\hat{B}_K$ and the other is $V_{cb}$. We use the lattice results of $\\hat{B}_K$ and exclusive $V_{cb}$ to calculate the theoretical estimate of $ε_K$, which turns out to be $3.1σ$ away from its experimental value. Here, the error is evaluated using the standard error propagation method.",

We extend staggered chiral perturbation theory (\\schpt) to include such all-staggered heavy-light mesons.

Using this \\schpt, the leptonic decay constant of the heavy-light meson is calculated at next-to-leading-order.

      "summary": "We report on the status of our kaon semileptonic form factor calculations using the highly-improved staggered quark (HISQ) formulation to simulate the valence fermions. We present results for the form factor f_+^{K π}(0) on the asqtad N_f=2+1 MILC configurations, discuss the chiral-continuum extrapolation, and give a preliminary estimate of the total error. We also present a more preliminary set of results for the same form factor but with the sea quarks also simulated with the HISQ action; these results include data at the physical light quark masses. The improvements that we expect to achieve with the use of the HISQ configurations and simulations at the physical quark masses are briefly discussed.",

      "summary": "We study QCD with 2 colour-sextet quarks as a model for walking Technicolor, using lattice gauge theory simulations (RHMC) at finite temperature. Our goal is to determine if the massless theory is QCD-like (confining, with spontaneously-broken chiral symmetry) with a slowly varying coupling (walks) or if it is a conformal field theory. We do this by simulating the theory at finite temperature and observing how the coupling at the chiral-symmetry restoration temperature depends on the temporal extent $N_t$ of the lattice (in lattice units). If the theory is QCD-like, this coupling should approach zero in the large $N_t$ limit in the manner predicted by asymptotic freedom. If it is conformal, this coupling should approach a finite value in this limit, i.e. the transition would be a bulk transition. We discuss new results at $N_t=6,8$ and 12. These preliminary results indicate that the coupling does decrease with increasing $N_t$, but it is unclear if this is consistent with asymptotic freedom.",

As in the original formula, our final result is a relation between weak matrix elements in finite and infinite volumes. Our extension is limited to final states with two scalar particles, with center of mass energies below the lowest three- or four-particle threshold. Otherwise the extension is general, accommodating any number of channels, arbitrary strong coupling between channels, as well as any form of weak decay operators in the matrix elements. Among many possible applications, we emphasize that this is a necessary first step on the way to a lattice-QCD calculation of weak decay rates for D -> pi pi and D -> K K-bar. Our results allow for arbitrary total momentum and hold for degenerate or non-degenerate particles.",

      "title": "Spontaneous Chiral Symmetry Breaking as Condensation of Dynamical Chirality",
      "summary": "The occurrence of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking (SChSB) is equivalent to sufficient abundance of Dirac near-zeromodes. However, dynamical mechanism leading to breakdown of chiral symmetry should be naturally reflected in chiral properties of the modes. Here we offer such connection, presenting evidence that SChSB in QCD proceeds via the appearance of modes exhibiting dynamical tendency for local chiral polarization. These modes form a band of finite width Lambda_ch (chiral polarization scale) around the surface of otherwise anti--polarized Dirac sea, and condense. Lambda_ch characterizes the dynamics of the breaking phenomenon and can be converted to a quark mass scale, thus offering conceptual means to determine which quarks of nature are governed by broken chiral dynamics. It is proposed that, within the context of SU(3) gauge theories with fundamental Dirac quarks, mode condensation is equivalent to chiral polarization. This makes Lambda_ch an \"order parameter\" of SChSB, albeit without local dynamical field representation away from chiral limit. Several uses of these features, both at zero and finite temperature, are discussed. Our initial estimates are Lambda_ch~150 MeV (N_f=0), Lambda_ch~80 MeV (N_f=2+1, physical point), and that the strange quark is too heavy to be crucially influenced by broken chiral symmetry.",

A technical oversight in the literature is uncovered: the application of the Cottingham Formula requires the use of a subtracted dispersion integral; an argument to evade the subtraction function was presented; the argument was based on false assumptions about the scaling violations of the parton model, a point first mentioned by J. C. Collins. We elucidate this point and utilize low-energy effective theory to relate the unknown subtraction function to the nucleon isovector magnetic polarizability. This allows us to provide the first reliable determination of dM = 1.30(03)(47) MeV [1].",

      "summary": "Models of new physics induce K_0-K_0bar mixing through operators having Dirac structures other than the \"left-left\" form of the Standard Model. To carry out the chiral-continuum extrapolation of results from numerical simulations, one needs to know the quark mass and lattice spacing dependence of the corresponding B-parameters in the partially quenched theory at least at next-to-leading order. For simulations using staggered fermions (such as that we are doing with HYP-smeared valence fermions on the MILC asqtad lattices) one must determine this dependence using staggered chiral perturbation theory (SChPT). We have calculated the required dependence in both SU(3) and SU(2) SChPT, working at next-to-leading order, and we give here an overview of the methodology and results. The SU(3) SChPT result turns out to be much simpler than that for the Standard Model B_K operator, due to the absence of chiral suppression for the new operators. The SU(2) SChPT result turns out to be closely related to that for B_K: the chiral logarithms are identical, up to an operator-dependent sign. Our results are also useful for fermions with chiral symmetry as they provide, in the continuum limit, the partially quenched generalization of existing continuum results.",

      "summary": "The determination of renormalization factors is of crucial importance. They relate the observables obtained on finite, discrete lattices to their measured counterparts in the continuum in a suitable renormalization scheme. Therefore, they have to be computed as precisely as possible. A widely used approach is the nonperturbative Rome-Southampton method. It requires, however, a careful treatment of lattice artifacts. They are always present because simulations are done at lattice spacings $a$ and momenta $p$ with $ap$ not necessarily small. In this paper we try to suppress these artifacts by subtraction of one-loop contributions in lattice perturbation theory. We compare results obtained from a complete one-loop subtraction with those calculated for a subtraction of $O(a^2)$.",

This integral is dominated by momenta of order the muon mass. Since in lattice QCD it is difficult to compute the vacuum polarization at a large number of low momenta, a parametrization of the vacuum polarization is required to extrapolate the data. Most fits to date are based on vector meson dominance, which introduces model dependence into the lattice computation of the magnetic moment. Here we introduce a model-independent extrapolation method, and present a few first tests of this new method.",

For the studied momentum range, the energy of moving states shows quadratic momentum-dependence and the width of moving states does not show significant changes as the momentum of bottomonium is increased.

      "summary": "As new experimental data arrive from the LHC the prospect of indirectly detecting new physics through precision tests of the Standard Model grows more exciting. Precise experimental and theoretical inputs are required to test the unitarity of the CKM matrix and to search for new physics effects in rare decays. Lattice QCD calculations of nonperturbative inputs have reached a precision at the level of a few percent; in many cases aided by the use of lattice perturbation theory. This review examines the role of lattice perturbation theory in B physics calculations on the lattice in the context of two questions: how is lattice perturbation theory used in the different heavy quark formalisms implemented by the major lattice collaborations? And what role does lattice perturbation theory play in determinations of nonperturbative contributions to the physical processes at the heart of the search for new physics? Framing and addressing these questions reveals that lattice perturbation theory is a tool with a spectrum of applications in lattice B physics.",

When they pinch the real axis, finite size scaling allows one to distinguish between first and second order transition and to estimate exponents. On the other hand, a gap signals confinement and the method can be used to explore the boundary of the conformal window. We present recent numerical results for 2D O(N) sigma models, 4D U(1) and SU(2) pure gauge and SU(3) gauge theory with N_f=4 and 12 flavors. We discuss attempts to understand some of these results using analytical methods. We discuss the 2-lattice matching and qualitative aspects of the renormalization group (RG) flows in the Migdal-Kadanoff approximation, in particular how RG flows starting at large beta seem to move around regions where bulk transitions occur. We consider the effects of the boundary conditions on the nonperturbative part of the average energy and on the Fisher zeros for the 1D O(2) model.",

Lattice QCD provides first-principle calculations for the physics in the non-perturbative regime. In this contribution, we report on recent progress by the HotQCD collaboration in studying the 2+1 flavor equation of state on lattices with the temporal extent N_tau=6, 8, 10 and 12 in Highly Improved Staggered Quarks (HISQ) discretization scheme. Comparisons with equation of state calculations with different fermion actions are also discussed.",

      "summary": "By analyzing the external field dependence of correlation functions, the magnetic properties of hadrons can be determined using lattice QCD in magnetic fields. To compute the magnetic moments and polarizabilities of charged hadrons, for example, one requires sufficiently weak magnetic fields. Such field strengths, however, lead to closely spaced Landau levels that are not straightforwardly resolved using standard lattice spectroscopy. Focusing on charged spinless hadrons, we introduce a simple projection technique that can be used to isolate the lowest Landau level. As the technique requires the explicit coordinate-space wave-function, we investigate the extent to which the continuum, infinite volume wave-function can be employed. We find that, in practice, the effects of discretization can be handled using a perturbative expansion about the continuum. Finite volume corrections are taken into account by using the discrete magnetic translational invariance of the torus. We show that quantized magnetic fields can lead to pernicious volume effects which depend on the magnetic flux quantum, rather than on the lattice volume.",

The interaction potential of the tetraquark system is calculated on the lattice with 2+1 flavours of dynamical fermions with lattice interpolating fields constructed using colorwave propagators. These propagators provide a new method for constructing all-to-all spatially smeared the interpolating fields, a technique which allows for a better overlap with the ground state wavefunction as well as reduced statistical noise. Potentials are extracted for 24 distinct channels, and are fit with a phenomenological non-relativistic quark model potential, from which a determination of the existence of bound states is made via numerical solution of the two body radial Schrödinger equation.",

The simulation scenario is first motivated by extrapolating current trends in computational resource requirements for lattice QCD into the future. Using the historical development of lattice gauge theory technology as a guide, we assume that our universe is an early numerical simulation with unimproved Wilson fermion discretization and investigate potentially-observable consequences. Among the observables that are considered are the muon g-2 and the current differences between determinations of alpha, but the most stringent bound on the inverse lattice spacing of the universe, b^(-1) >~ 10^(11) GeV, is derived from the high-energy cut off of the cosmic ray spectrum. The numerical simulation scenario could reveal itself in the distributions of the highest energy cosmic rays exhibiting a degree of rotational symmetry breaking that reflects the structure of the underlying lattice.",

The calculation employs a 2+1-flavor mixed-action lattice scheme, thus treating the strange quark degrees of freedom in dynamical fashion. Numerical results are obtained at three pion masses, m_pi = 495 MeV, 356 MeV, and 293 MeV, renormalized, and chirally extrapolated to the physical pion mass. The value extracted for Delta s at the physical pion mass in the MSbar scheme at a scale of 2 GeV is Delta s = -0.031(17), whereas the strange quark contribution to the nucleon mass amounts to f_Ts =0.046(11). In the employed mixed-action scheme, the nucleon valence quarks as well as the strange quarks entering the nucleon matrix elements which determine f_Ts and Delta s are realized as domain wall fermions, propagators of which are evaluated in MILC 2+1-flavor dynamical asqtad quark ensembles. The use of domain wall fermions leads to mild renormalization behavior which proves especially advantageous in the extraction of f_Ts.",

      "summary": "The first numerical investigation of non-relativistic aspects of the Thomas-Fermi (TF) statistical multi-quark model is given. We begin with a review of the traditional TF model without an explicit spin interaction and find that the spin splittings are too small in this approach. An explicit spin interaction is then introduced which entails the definition of a generalized spin \"flavor\". We investigate baryonic states in this approach which can be described with two inequivalent wave functions; such states can however apply to multiple degenerate flavors. We find that the model requires a spatial separation of quark flavors, even if completely degenerate. Although the TF model is designed to investigate the possibility of many-quark states, we find surprisingly that it may be used to fit the low energy spectrum of almost all ground state octet and decuplet baryons. The charge radii of such states are determined and compared with lattice calculations and other models. The low energy fit obtained allows us to extrapolate to the six-quark doubly strange {\\it H}-dibaryon state, flavor symmetric strange states of higher quark content and possible six quark nucleon-nucleon resonances. The emphasis here is on the {\\it systematics} revealed in this approach. We view our model as a versatile and convenient tool for quickly assessing the characteristics of new, possibly bound, particle states of higher quark number content.",

We carry out the renormalization of the observables under study and perform the continuum limit both at T>0 and at T=0, using different lattice spacings. Finite size effects are studied by using various spatial lattice volumes. The magnetic susceptibilities χ_f reveal a diamagnetic behavior; we obtain at zero temperature χ_u=-(2.08 +/- 0.08) 1/GeV^2, χ_d=-(2.02 +/- 0.09) 1/GeV^2 and χ_s=-(3.4 +/- 1.4) 1/GeV^2 for the up, down and strange quarks, respectively, in the MSBar scheme at a renormalization scale of 2 GeV.

      "summary": "Most of the mass of everyday objects resides in atomic nuclei; the total of the electrons' mass adds up to less than one part in a thousand. The nuclei are composed of nucleons---protons and neutrons---whose nuclear binding energy, though tremendous on a human scale, is small compared to their rest energy. The nucleons are, in turn, composites of massless gluons and nearly massless quarks. It is the energy of these confined objects, via $M=E/c^2$, that is responsible for everyday mass. This article discusses the physics of this mechanism and the role of lattice gauge theory in establishing its connection to quantum chromodynamics.",

Fitting isospin-averaged perturbation theory functions to PACS-CS and QCDSF-UKQCD Collaboration lattice simulations of octet baryon masses, and using the physical light quark mass ratio $m_u/m_d$ as input, allows $M_n-M_p$, $M_{Σ^-}-M_{Σ^+}$ and $M_{Ξ^-}-M_{Ξ^0}$ to be evaluated from the full SU(3) theory. The resulting values for each mass splitting are consistent with the experimental values after allowing for electromagnetic corrections. In the case of the nucleon, we find $M_n-M_p= 2.9 \\pm 0.4 \\textrm{MeV}$, with the dominant uncertainty arising from the error in $m_u/m_d$.",

The key to this success is the combination of using a nearly physical pion mass and excluding the contributions of excited states. An analogous calculation of the nucleon axial charge governing beta decay has inconsistencies indicating a source of bias at low pion masses not present for the other observables and yields a result that disagrees with experiment.",

      "summary": "New results are reported from large scale lattice simulations of a frequently discussed strongly interacting gauge theory with a fermion flavor doublet in the two-index symmetric (sextet) representation of the SU(3) color gauge group. We find that the chiral condensate and the mass spectrum of the sextet model are consistent with chiral symmetry breaking in the limit of vanishing fermion mass. In contrast, sextet fermion mass deformations of spectral properties are not consistent with leading conformal scaling behavior near the critical surface of a conformal theory. A recent paper could not resolve the conformal fixed point of the gauge coupling from the slowly walking scenario of a very small nearly vanishing β-function (DeGrand:2012yq). It is argued that overall consistency with our new results is resolved if the sextet model is close to the conformal window, staying outside with a very small non-vanishing β-function. The model would exhibit then the simplest composite Higgs mechanism leaving open the possibility of a light scalar state with quantum numbers of the Higgs impostor. It would emerge as the pseudo-Goldstone dilaton state from spontaneous symmetry breaking of scale invariance. We will argue that even without association with the dilaton, the scalar Higgs-like state can be light very close to the conformal window. A new Higgs project of sextet lattice simulations is outlined to resolve these important questions.",

      "summary": "Large $N_c$ and holographic arguments, as well as Monte Carlo results, suggest that the topological structure of the QCD vacuum is dominated by codimension-one membranes which appear as thin dipole layers of topological charge. Such membranes arise naturally as $D6$ branes in the holographic formulation of QCD based on IIA string theory. The polarizability of these membranes leads to a vacuum energy $\\propto θ^2$, providing the origin of nonzero topological susceptibility. Here we show that the axial U(1) anomaly can be formulated as anomaly inflow on the brane surfaces. A 4D gauge transformation at the brane surface separates into a 3D gauge transformation of components within the brane and the transformation of the transverse component. The in-brane gauge transformation induces currents of an effective Chern-Simons theory on the brane surface, while the transformation of the transverse component describes the transverse motion of the brane and is related to the Ramond-Ramond closed string field in the holographic formulation of QCD. The relation between the surface currents and the transverse motion of the brane is dictated by the descent equations of Yang-Mills theory.",

The S-wave scattering lengths are calculated using Lüscher's finite volume technique. We use a relativistic formulation for the charm quark. For the light quark, we use domain-wall fermions in the valence sector and improved Kogut-Susskind sea quarks. We calculate the scattering lengths of isospin-3/2 $Dπ$, $D_sπ$, $D_sK$, isospin-0 $D\\bar{K}$ and isospin-1 $D\\bar{K}$ channels on the lattice. For the chiral extrapolation, we use a chiral unitary approach to next-to-leading order, which at the same time allows us to give predictions for other channels. It turns out that our results support the interpretation of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ as a $DK$ molecule. At the same time, we also update a prediction for the isospin breaking hadronic decay width $Γ(D_{s0}^*(2317)\\to D_sπ)$ to $(133\\pm22)$ keV.",

      "summary": "We present physical results for a variety of light hadronic quantities obtained via a combined analysis of three 2+1 flavour domain wall fermion ensemble sets. For two of our ensemble sets we used the Iwasaki gauge action with beta=2.13 (a^-1=1.75(4) GeV) and beta=2.25 (a^-1=2.31(4) GeV) and lattice sizes of 24^3 x 64 and 32^3 x 64 respectively, with unitary pion masses in the range 293(5)-417(10) MeV. The extent L_s for the 5^th dimension of the domain wall fermion formulation is L_s=16 in these ensembles. In this analysis we include a third ensemble set that makes use of the novel Iwasaki+DSDR (Dislocation Suppressing Determinant Ratio) gauge action at beta = 1.75 (a^-1=1.37(1) GeV) with a lattice size of 32^3 x 64 and L_s=32 to reach down to partially-quenched pion masses as low as 143(1) MeV and a unitary pion mass of 171(1) MeV, while retaining good chiral symmetry and topological tunneling. We demonstrate a significant improvement in our control over the chiral extrapolation, resulting in much improved continuum predictions for the above quantities. The main results of this analysis include the pion and kaon decay constants, f_π=127(3)_{stat}(3)_{sys} MeV and f_K = 152(3)_{stat}(2)_{sys} MeV respectively (f_K/f_π= 1.199(12)_{stat}(14)_{sys}); the average up/down quark mass and the strange-quark mass in the MSbar-scheme at 3 GeV, m_{ud}(MSbar, 3 GeV) = 3.05(8)_{stat}(6)_{sys} MeV and m_s(MSbar, 3 GeV) = 83.5(1.7)_{stat}(1.1)_{sys}; the neutral kaon mixing parameter in the MSbar-scheme at 3 GeV, B_K(MSbar,3 GeV) = 0.535(8)_{stat}(13)_{sys}, and in the RGI scheme, \\hat B_K = 0.758(11)_{stat}(19)_{sys}; and the Sommer scales r_1 = 0.323(8)_{stat}(4)_{sys} fm and r_0 = 0.480(10)_{stat}(4)_{sys} (r_1/r_0 = 0.673(11)_{stat}(3)_{sys}). We also obtain values for the SU(2) ChPT effective couplings, \\bar{l_3} = 2.91(23)_{stat}(7)_{sys}$ and \\bar{l_4} = 3.99(16)_{stat}(9)_{sys}.",

The error reduction techniques, referred to as covariant approximation averaging, utilize approximations which are covariant under lattice symmetry transformations. We observed cost reductions from the new method compared to the traditional one, for fixed statistical error, of 16 times for the nucleon mass at $M_π\\sim 330$ MeV (Domain-Wall quark) and 2.6-20 times for the hadronic vacuum polarization at $M_π\\sim 480$ MeV (Asqtad quark).

      "summary": "We study the two-point Topological Charge Density Correlator (TCDC) in lattice QCD with two degenerate flavours of unimproved Wilson fermions and Wilson gauge action at two values of lattice spacings and different volumes, for a range of quark masses. Configurations are generated with DDHMC algorithm and smoothed with HYP smearing. In order to shed light on the mechanisms leading to the observed suppression of topological susceptibility with respect to the decreasing quark mass and decreasing volume, in this work, we carry out a detailed study of the two-point TCDC. We have shown that, (1) the TCDC is negative beyond a positive core and radius of the core shrinks as lattice spacing decreases, (2) as the volume decreases, the magnitude of the contact term and the radius of the positive core decrease and the magnitude of the negative peak increases resulting in the suppression of the topological susceptibility as the volume decreases, (3) the contact term and radius of the positive core decrease with decreasing quark mass at a given lattice spacing and the negative peak increases with decreasing quark mass resulting in the suppression of the topological susceptibility with decreasing quark mass, (4) increasing levels of smearing suppresses the contact term and the negative peak keeping the susceptibility intact and (5) both the contact term and the negative peak diverge in nonintegrable fashion as lattice spacing decreases. It is gratifying to note that observations similar to 1 and 5 have been made using topological charge density operator based on chiral fermion. The observations 2 and 3 may be confirmed more precisely by using formulations based on chiral fermions.",

These ratios can reliably be calculated in lattice QCD for a wide range of chemical potential values by using a next-to-leading order Taylor series expansion around the limit of vanishing baryon, electric charge and strangeness chemical potentials. From a computation of up to fourth order cumulants and charge correlations we first determine the strangeness and electric charge chemical potentials that characterize freeze-out conditions in a heavy ion collision and confirm that in the temperature range 150 MeV < T < 170 MeV the hadron resonance gas model provides good approximations for these parameters that agree with QCD calculations on the (5-15)% level. We then show that a comparison of lattice QCD results for ratios of up to third order cumulants of electric charge fluctuations with experimental results allows to extract the freeze-out baryon chemical potential and the freeze-out temperature.",

The small volume dynamics is dominated by the constant gauge fields. The expectation value of the field strength tensor squared is calculated for positive flow time t by treating the non-zero gauge modes perturbatively and the zero modes exactly. The finite volume correction to the infinite volume result is found to contain both algebraic and exponential terms. The leading order result is then used to define a one parameter family of running coupling schemes in which the coupling runs with the linear size of the box. The new scheme is tested numerically in SU(3) gauge theory coupled to N_f = 4 flavors of massless fundamental fermions. The calculations are performed at several lattice spacings with a controlled continuum extrapolation. The continuum result agrees with the perturbative 2-loop prediction for small renormalized coupling as expected.",

For both of these systems, we have observed a strongly-coupled lattice phase in which the single-site shift symmetry of the staggered action is spontaneously broken. Here we report new results for finite-temperature transitions on 24^3x12 and 32^3x16 lattice volumes, contrasting the 8- and 12-flavor systems. While the Nf=12 finite-temperature transitions accumulate at the bulk transition bounding the strongly-coupled lattice phase, the Nf=8 finite-temperature transitions are able to pass through the bulk transition, and behave as expected for a QCD-like system. We discuss our current results and the work in progress to complete our investigation of the finite-temperature phase diagram.",

This relation holds both in IR-conformal systems, as well as in confining systems for large enough eigenvalues. We investigate the Nf=4, 8 and 12 flavor SU(3) systems at several couplings near the chiral limit, and show that in general the scaling exponent varies with the eigenvalue, describing the dependence of gamma_m on the energy (or, equivalently, on the running coupling). This energy dependence can be explored even with fixed lattice parameters (bare coupling and mass). We find that for the 4 flavor system the mass anomalous dimension decreases as the energy increases, consistent with perturbative expectations. For the 8 flavor system the energy dependence is too weak to be observable at present. The 12 flavor system at our strongest couplings shows the anomalous dimension increasing with energy, consistent with backward flow and the presence of an infrared fixed point. At weaker couplings we determine a preliminary value for the mass anomalous dimension of the 12 flavor system at the infrared fixed point, gamma_m^*=0.27(3).",

In this paper, we consider two different parton OAM distributions. The first is manifestly gauge invariant, and its moments are local operators and calculable in lattice QCD. We show that it can potentially be measured through twist-three GPDs. The second is the much-debated canonical OAM distribution natural in free-field theory and light-cone gauge. We show the latter in light-cone gauge can also be related to twist-three GPDs as well as quantum phase-space Wigner distributions, both being measurable in high-energy experiments.",

      "summary": "We present the results of a calculation of the positive-parity ground-state charmed-baryon spectrum using 2+1+1 flavors of dynamical quarks. The calculation uses a relativistic heavy-quark action for the valence charm quark, clover-Wilson fermions for the valence light and strange quarks, and HISQ sea quarks. The spectrum is calculated with a lightest pion mass around 220 MeV, and three lattice spacings (a \\approx 0.12 fm, 0.09 fm, and 0.06 fm) are used to extrapolate to the continuum. The light-quark mass extrapolation is performed using heavy-hadron chiral perturbation theory up to O(m_pi^3) and at next-to-leading order in the heavy-quark mass. For the well-measured charmed baryons, our results show consistency with the experimental values. For the controversial J=1/2 Xi_{cc}, we obtain the isospin-averaged value M_{Xi_{cc}}=3595(39)(20)(6) MeV (the three uncertainties are statistics, fitting-window systematic, and systematics from other lattice artifacts, such as lattice scale setting and pion-mass determination), which shows a 1.7 sigma deviation from the experimental value. We predict the yet-to-be-discovered doubly and triply charmed baryons Xi_{cc}^*, Omega_{cc}, Omega_{cc}^* and Omega_{ccc} to have masses 3648(42)(18)(7) MeV, 3679(40)(17)(5) MeV, 3765(43)(17)(5) MeV and 4761(52)(21)(6) MeV, respectively.",

Utilizing the highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ) type action which is useful to study the continuum physics, we analyze the lattice data of the mass and the decay constant of a pseudoscalar meson and the mass of a vector meson as well at several values of lattice spacing and fermion mass. Our result is consistent with the conformal hypothesis for the mass anomalous dimension $γ_m \\sim 0.4-0.5$.",

The Möbius class interpolates between Shamir's domain wall operator and Boriçi's domain wall implementation of Neuberger's overlap operator without increasing the number of Dirac applications per conjugate gradient iteration. A new scaling parameter ($α$) reduces chiral violations at finite fifth dimension ($L_s$) but yields exactly the same overlap action in the limit $L_s \\rightarrow \\infty$. Through the use of 4d Red/Black preconditioning and optimal tuning for the scaling $α(L_s)$, we show that chiral symmetry violations are typically reduced by an order of magnitude at fixed $L_s$. At large $L_s$ we argue that the observed scaling for $m_{res} = O(1/L_s)$ for Shamir is replaced by $m_{res} = O(1/L_s^2)$ for the properly tuned Möbius algorithm with $α= O(L_s)$",

      "summary": "The semileptonic decay channel B -> D tau nu is sensitive to the presence of a scalar current, such as that mediated by a charged-Higgs boson. Recently the BaBar experiment reported the first observation of the exclusive semileptonic decay B -> D tau nu, finding an approximately 2-sigma disagreement with the Standard-Model prediction for the ratio R(D)=BR(B->D tau nu)/BR(B->D l nu), where l=e,mu. We compute this ratio of branching fractions using hadronic form factors computed in unquenched lattice QCD and obtain R(D) = 0.316(12)(7), where the errors are statistical and total systematic, respectively. This result is the first Standard-Model calculation of R(D) from ab initio full QCD. Its error is smaller than that of previous estimates, primarily due to the reduced uncertainty in the scalar form factor f_0(q^2). Our determination of R(D) is approximately 1-sigma higher than previous estimates and, thus, reduces the tension with experiment. We also compute R(D) in models with electrically charged scalar exchange, such as the type II two-Higgs doublet model. Once again, our result is consistent with, but approximately 1-sigma higher than, previous estimates for phenomenologically relevant values of the scalar coupling in the type II model. As a byproduct of our calculation, we also present the Standard-Model prediction for the longitudinal polarization ratio P_L (D)= 0.325(4)(3).",

The new determination incorporates HPQCD's improved scale r_1^{N_f = 2+1} = 0.3133(23) fm, accurately retuned bare charm quark masses and data from an ensemble that is more chiral than in our previous calculations. We find f_D = 208.3(3.4) MeV. Combining the new f_D with D -> μν branching fraction data from CLEO-c, we extract the CKM matrix element |V_cd| = 0.223(10)_{exp.}(4)_{lat.}. This value is in excellent agreement with |V_cd| from D semileptonic decays and from neutrino scattering experiments and has comparable total errors. We determine the ratio between semileptonic form factor and decay constant and find [f^{D -> π}_+(0) / f_D ]_{lat.} = 3.20(15) GeV^{-1} to be compared with the experimental value of [f^{D -> π}_+(0) / f_D ]_{exp.} = 3.19(18) GeV^{-1}.

The extracted CS and DS for $\\bar u(x) + \\bar d(x)$ have distinct Bjorken $x$ dependence in qualitative agreement with expectation. The analysis also shows that the momentum fraction of the $\\bar u(x) + \\bar d(x)$ is about equally divided between CS and DS at $Q^2 = 2.5 {\\rm GeV}^2$.

      "summary": "We calculate the masses of bottom mesons using an improved relativistic action for the b-quarks and the RBC/UKQCD Iwasaki gauge configurations with 2+1 flavors of dynamical domain-wall light quarks. We analyze configurations with two lattice spacings: a^{-1} = 1.729 GeV (a ~ 0.11 fm) and a^{-1} = 2.281 GeV (a ~ 0.086 fm). We use an anisotropic, clover-improved Wilson action for the b-quark, and tune the three parameters of the action nonperturbatively such that they reproduce the experimental values of the B_s and B_s* heavy-light meson states. The masses and mass-splittings of the low-lying bottomonium states (such as the eta_b and Upsilon) can then be computed with no additional inputs, and comparison between these predictions and experiment provides a test of the validity of our method. We obtain bottomonium masses with total uncertainties of ~0.5-0.6% and fine-structure splittings with uncertainties of ~35-45%; for all cases we find good agreement with experiment. The parameters of the relativistic heavy-quark action tuned for b-quarks presented in this work can be used for precise calculations of weak matrix elements such as B-meson decay constants and mixing parameters with lattice discretization errors that are of the same size as in light pseudoscalar meson quantities. This general method can also be used for charmed meson masses and matrix elements if the parameters of the heavy-quark action are appropriately tuned.",

The mass of $η_{c2}$ is determined to be 3.80(3) GeV, which is close to the mass of $D$-wave charmonium $ψ(3770)$ and in agreement with quark model predictions. The transition width of $η_{c2}\\to γJ/ψ$ is also obtained with a value $Γ=3.8(9)$ keV. Since the possible $2^{-+}$ assignment to X(3872) has not been ruled out by experiments, our results help to clarify the nature of X(3872).",

      "summary": "Temporal quark correlation functions are analyzed in quenched lattice QCD for two values of temperature above the critical temperature (Tc) for deconfinement, T=1.5Tc and 3Tc. A two-pole ansatz for the quark spectral function is used to determine the bare quark mass and the momentum dependence of excitation spectra on large lattices of size up to 128^3x16. The dependence of the quark correlator on these parameters as well as the finite volume dependence of the excitation energies are analyzed in detail in order to examine the reliability of our analysis. Our results suggest the existence of quasi-particle peaks in the quark spectrum. We furthermore find evidence that the dispersion relation of the plasmino mode has a minimum at non-zero momentum even in the non-perturbative region near Tc. We also elaborate on the enhancement of the quark correlator near the chiral limit which is observed at T=1.5Tc on about half of the gauge configurations. We attribute this to the presence of near zero-modes of the fermion matrix that are associated with non-trivial topology of the gauge configurations.",

      "summary": "We present a systematic study of the effectiveness of light quark mass reweighting. This method allows a single lattice QCD ensemble, generated with a specific value of the dynamical light quark mass, to be used to determine results for other, nearby light dynamical quark masses. We study two gauge field ensembles generated with 2+1 flavors of dynamical domain wall fermions with light quark masses m_l=0.02 (m_π=620 MeV) and m_l=0.01 (m_π=420 MeV). We reweight each ensemble to determine results which could be computed directly from the other and check the consistency of the reweighted results with the direct results. The large difference between the 0.02 and 0.01 light quark masses suggests that this is an aggressive application of reweighting as can be seen from fluctuations in the magnitude of the reweighting factor by four orders of magnitude. Never-the-less, a comparison of the reweighed topological charge, average plaquette, residual mass, pion mass, pion decay constant, and scalar correlator between these two ensembles shows agreement well described by the statistical errors. The issues of the effective number of configurations and finite sample size bias are discussed. An examination of the topological charge distribution implies that it is more favorable to reweight from heavier mass to lighter quark mass.",

We also present results for the ratio of bag parameters B_{B_s}/B_{B_d} and the ratio of CKM matrix elements |V_{td}|/|V_{ts}|.

We show that perturbation theory describes very well the lattice data at short distances, and exploit this fact to obtain a determination of the product of the lattice scale r_0 with the QCD scale Lambda_{MS}. With the input of the value of r_0, this provides a determination of the strong coupling alpha_s at the typical distance scale of the lattice data. We obtain alpha_s(1.5 GeV)=0.326\\pm0.019, which provides a novel determination of alpha_s at low energy and with three-loop accuracy (including resummation of the leading ultrasoft logarithms). When this value is evolved to the Z-mass scale M_Z, it corresponds to alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1156^{+0.0021}_{-0.0022}.",

A controlled chiral extrapolation of a recent PACS-CS Collaboration data set yields baryon masses which exhibit remarkable agreement both with experimental values at the physical point and with the results of independent lattice QCD simulations at unphysical meson masses. Using the Feynman-Hellmann relation, we evaluate sigma commutators for all octet baryons. The small statistical uncertainty, and considerably smaller model-dependence, allows a signifcantly more precise determination of the pion-nucleon sigma commutator and the strangeness sigma term than hitherto possible, namely σπN=45 \\pm 6 MeV and σs = 21 \\pm 6 MeV at the physical point.",

To construct these systems, we develop a range of new algorithms for performing the factorially large numbers of Wick contractions required in multi-hadron systems. We then use these methods to study systems with the quantum numbers of up to 72 $π^+$'s on three ensembles of gauge configurations with spatial extents $L\\sim$ 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 fm, and light quark masses corresponding to a pion mass of {390 MeV}. The ground state energies of these systems are extracted and the volume dependence of these energies is utilized to determine the two- and three- body interactions amongst $π^+$'s. The systems studied correspond to isospin densities of up to $ρ_I\\sim 9\\ {\\rm fm}^{-3}$ and probe isospin chemical potentials, $μ_I$, in the range $m_π \\lsim μ_I\\ \\lsim 4.5\\ m_π$, allowing us to investigate aspects of the QCD phase diagram at low temperature and for varying isospin chemical potential. By studying the energy density of the system, we provide numerical evidence for the conjectured transition of the system to a Bose-Einstein condensed phase at $μ_I\\ \\gsim m_π$.",

      "summary": "Determining the spectrum of hadronic excitations from Monte Carlo simulations requires the use of interpolating operators that couple to multi-particle states. Recent algorithmic advances have made the inclusion of multi-hadron operators in spectroscopy calculations a practical reality. In this talk, a procedure for constructing a set of multi-hadron interpolators that project onto the states of interest is described. To aid in the interpretation of simulation data, operators are designed to transform irreducibly under the lattice symmetry group. The identification of a set of optimal single-hadron interpolators for states with non-zero momenta is an essential intermediate step in this analysis.",

      "summary": "The leading hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment is given by a weighted integral over euclidean momentum of the hadronic vacuum polarization. This integral is dominated by momenta of order the muon mass. Since the finite volume in lattice QCD makes it difficult to compute the vacuum polarization at a large number of low momenta with high statistics (combined with the fact that one cannot compute it at zero momentum), a parametrization of the vacuum polarization is required to extrapolate the data. A much used functional form is based on vector meson dominance, which introduces model dependence into the lattice computation of the magnetic moment. Here we introduce a model-independent extrapolation method, and present a few first tests of this new method.",

      "summary": "We present results on both the restoration of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry and the effective restoration of the anomalously broken U(1)_A symmetry in finite temperature QCD at zero chemical potential using lattice QCD. We employ domain wall fermions on lattices with fixed temporal extent N_τ= 8 and spatial extent N_σ= 16 in a temperature range of T = 139 - 195 MeV, corresponding to lattice spacings of a \\approx 0.12 - 0.18 fm. In these calculations, we include two degenerate light quarks and a strange quark at fixed pion mass m_π= 200 MeV. The strange quark mass is set near its physical value. We also present results from a second set of finite temperature gauge configurations at the same volume and temporal extent with slightly heavier pion mass. To study chiral symmetry restoration, we calculate the chiral condensate, the disconnected chiral susceptibility, and susceptibilities in several meson channels of different quantum numbers. To study U(1)_A restoration, we calculate spatial correlators in the scalar and pseudo-scalar channels, as well as the corresponding susceptibilities. Furthermore, we also show results for the eigenvalue spectrum of the Dirac operator as a function of temperature, which can be connected to both U(1)_A and chiral symmetry restoration via Banks-Casher relations.",

We probe the $N_f=12$ model with respect to the conformal window using mass deformed finite size scaling (FSS) theory driven by the fermion mass anomalous dimension. Our results at fixed gauge coupling show problems with the conformal scenario of the $N_f=12$ model. In the sextet model with two flavors, under the conformal hypothesis, we determine large values for the anomalous fermion mass dimension with $γ\\geq 1$. Since our sextet analysis favors the chiral symmetry breaking hypothesis without conformality, the large exponent $γ$ could play an important role in understanding the composite Higgs mechanism. The new results discussed here include our extended data sets and exceed what was presented at the conference.",

These ensembles feature 2+1 flavors of two-fold stout-smeared dynamical staggered fermions combined with Symanzik glue, with pion masses varying from 135 to 435 MeV, lattice scales between 0.7 and 2.0 GeV, while m_s is kept fixed at its physical value. Moderate taste splittings and the scale being set through the pion decay constant allow us to restrict ourselves to the taste pseudoscalar state and to use formulas from continuum chiral perturbation theory. Finally, by dropping the data points near 135 MeV from the fits, we can explore the range of pion masses that is needed in SU(2) chiral perturbation theory to reliably extrapolate to the physical point.",

      "title": "Hybrid Monte Carlo simulation on the graphene hexagonal lattice",
      "summary": "One of the many remarkable properties of graphene is that in the low energy limit the dynamics of its electrons can be effectively described by the massless Dirac equation. This has prompted investigations of graphene based on the lattice simulation of a system of 2-dimensional fermions on a square staggered lattice. We demonstrate here how to construct the path integral for graphene working directly on the graphene hexagonal lattice. For the nearest neighbor tight binding model interacting with a long range Coulomb interaction between the electrons, this leads to the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm with no sign problem. The only approximation is the discretization of the Euclidean time. So as we extrapolate to the time continuum limit, the exact tight binding solution maybe found numerically to arbitrary precession on a finite hexagonal lattice. The potential for this approach is tested on a single hexagonal cell.",

      "summary": "We explore how rotational invariance is systematically recovered from calculations on hyper-cubic lattices through the use of smeared lattice operators that smoothly evolve into continuum operators with definite angular momentum as the lattice-spacing is reduced. Perturbative calculations of the angular momentum violation associated with such operators at tree-level and at one-loop are presented in phi^4 theory and QCD. Contributions from these operators that violate rotational invariance occur at tree-level, with coefficients that are suppressed by O(a^2) in the continuum limit. Quantum loops do not modify this behavior in phi^4, nor in QCD if the gauge-fields are smeared over a comparable spatial region. Consequently, the use of this type of operator should, in principle, allow for Lattice QCD calculations of the higher moments of the hadron structure functions.",

Additionally, we present a preliminary calculation of the intrinsic charm of the nucleon using the HISQ action with dynamical charm. The calculation is done with a method which incorporates features of both commonly-used methods, the direct evaluation of the three-point function and the application of the Feynman- Hellman theorem. We present an improvement on this method that further reduces the statistical error, and check the result from this hybrid method against the other two methods and find that they are consistent. The values for <N|ss|N> and <N|cc|N> found here, together with perturbative results for heavy quarks, show that dark matter scattering through Higgs-like exchange receives roughly equal contributions from all heavy quark flavors.",

The scattering phase shifts for this system are obtained from a numerical evaluation of the QCD path integral using the technique of Lattice QCD. Our calculations, performed at a pion mass of m_pi ~ 389 MeV in two large lattice volumes, and at one lattice spacing, are extrapolated to the physical pion mass using effective field theory. The interactions determined from QCD are consistent with those extracted from hyperon-nucleon experimental data within uncertainties, and strengthen theoretical arguments that the strange quark is a crucial component of dense nuclear matter.",

The results presented are accurate up to exponentially suppressed corrections in the volume due to the finite range of hadronic interactions. The formalism allows one to determine the phase shifts and mixing parameters of pipi-KK isosinglet coupled channels directly from Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics. We show that the extension to more than two channels is straightforward and present the result for three channels. From the energy quantization condition, the volume dependence of electroweak matrix elements of two-hadron processes is extracted. In the non-relativistic case, we pay close attention to processes that mix the 1S0-3S1 two-nucleon states, e.g. proton-proton fusion (pp -> d+ e^+ + nu_e), and show how to determine the transition amplitude of such processes directly from lattice QCD.",

For the required nonperturbative weak matrix elements, we use three-flavor lattice QCD averages from www.latticeaverages.org; these have been updated from Ref. [1] to reflect all available lattice calculations as of the \"End of 2011\". Because of the greater than 3 sigma disagreement between the extraction of |Vub| from inclusive and exclusive semileptonic b -> u l nu (l = e,mu) decays, particular emphasis is given to a clean fit in which we remove the information from these decays. Given current theoretical and experimental inputs, we observe an approximately 3 sigma tension in the CKM unitarity triangle that may indicate the presence of new physics in the quark-flavor sector. Using a model-independent parameterization of new-physics effects, we test the compatibility of the data with scenarios in which the new physics is in kaon mixing, in B-mixing, or in B -> tau nu decay. We find that scenarios with new physics in B -> tau nu decay or in B-mixing are approximately equally preferred. Finally, we interpret these results in terms contributions to Delta S = 2 and Delta B = 2 four-fermion operators. We find that the preferred scale of new physics (with Standard-Model like couplings) is in the few hundred GeV range.",

      "summary": "The standard model weak interactions can be described by four-fermion V-A operators at low energies. New physics at the TeV scale can, however, generate the other Lorentz structures. In this talk, we review the constraints on such interactions from nuclear and hadronic decays, as well as from collider searches. Currently the most stringent bounds come from the analysis of the 0+ to 0+ nuclear and the pi to e nu gamma radiative pion decays. In the near future, the ultracold neutron beta decay experiments and the direct LHC measurements will compete in setting the most stringent bounds, provided, however, that the neutron-to-proton non-perturbative transition matrix elements can be calculated to a level of 10-20% accuracy.",

      "summary": "We report a complete calculation of the quark and glue momenta and angular momenta in the proton. These include the quark contributions from both the connected and disconnected insertions. The calculation is carried out on a $16^3 \\times 24$ quenched lattice at $β= 6.0$ and for Wilson fermions with $κ= 0.154, 0.155,$ and 0.1555 which correspond to pion masses at 650, 538, and 478 MeV. The quark loops are calculated with $Z_4$ noise and signal-to-noise is improved further with unbiased subtractions. The glue operator is comprised of gauge-field tensors constructed from the overlap operator. The $u$ and $d$ quark momentum/angular momentum fraction is 0.66(5)/0.72(5), the strange momentum/angular momentum fraction is 0.024(6)/0.023(7), and that of the glue is 0.31(6)/0.25(8). The orbital angular momenta of the quarks are obtained from subtracting the angular momentum component from its corresponding spin. As a result, the quark orbital angular momentum constitutes 0.50(2) of the proton spin, with almost all it coming from the disconnected insertion. The quark spin carries a fraction 0.25(12) and glue carries a fraction 0.25(8) of the total proton spin.",

      "summary": "The isospin-2 pi pi system provides a useful testing ground for determining elastic hadron scattering parameters from finite-volume spectra obtained using lattice QCD computations. A reliable determination of the excited state spectrum of two pions in a cubic box follows from variational analysis of correlator matrices constructed using a large basis of operators. A general operator construction is presented which respects the symmetries of a multi-hadron system in flight. This is applied to the case of pi pi and allows for the determination of the scattering phase-shifts at a large number of kinematic points, in both S-wave and D-wave, within the elastic region. The technique is demonstrated with a calculation at a pion mass of 396 MeV, where the elastic scattering is found to be well described by a scattering length parameterisation.",

      "summary": "We report on new data from additional zero temperature simulations of QCD with 12 flavors. This is a continuation of previous studies using the DBW2 gauge action and naive staggered fermions. With the use of the force gradient integrator and a multiple-quark-mass preconditioned HMC, we have done simulations with input quark masses from $m_q=0.003$ to $m_q=0.008$. We have observed a metastable, first order, bulk transition that occurs at small input quark masses. As the quark mass increases, this first order bulk transition ends at a second order critical point, and, for still heavier quark masses, becomes the cross-over we have previously reported. We present measurements of hadron masses, decay constants and other low energy observables in the small quark mass region on the weak coupling side of the bulk transition. Our results show that the behavior of the system is still consistent with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry. We also discuss a preliminary investigation into the behavior of the bulk transition itself. We have found that, as the system approaches the second order critical end point, the scalar singlet meson becomes lighter. Thus it appears that the critical endpoint corresponds to a continuum limit theory only involving scalars and, following known triviality arguments, this is likely a free field theory. The presence of this critical endpoint could influence scaling of lattice observables in the conventional continuum limit.",

These quantities are low-energy constants of heavy-hadron chiral perturbation theory (HH$χ$PT) and are related to the $B^*Bπ$, $Σ_b^*Σ_bπ$, and $Σ_b^{(*)}Λ_bπ$ couplings. In the following, we discuss important details of the calculation and give further results. To determine the axial couplings, we explicitly match the matrix elements of the axial current in QCD with the corresponding matrix elements in HH$χ$PT. We construct the ratios of correlation functions used to calculate the matrix elements in lattice QCD, and study the contributions from excited states. We present the complete numerical results and discuss the data analysis in depth. In particular, we demonstrate the convergence of $SU(4|2)$ HH$χ$PT for the axial-current matrix elements at pion masses up to about 400 MeV and show the impact of the nonanalytic loop contributions. Finally, we present additional predictions for strong and radiative decay widths of charm and bottom baryons.",

This seems to contradict Dyson's argument suggesting that the instability at negative coupling implies a zero radius of convergence. Using the example of the linear sigma model in three dimensions, we discuss to which extent the two points of view are compatible. We show that a saddle point persists for negative values of lt until a critical value -|lt_c| is reached. A numerical study of the perturbative series for the renormalized mass confirms an expected singularity of the form (lt +|lt_c|)^1/2. However, for -|lt_c|< lt <0, the effective potential does not exist if phi^2 >phi^2_{max}(lt) and not at all if lt<-|lt_c|. We show that phi^2_{max}(lt) propto 1/|lt | for small negative lt. The finite radius of convergence can be justified if the effective theory is defined with a large field cutoff phi^2_{max}(lt) which provides a quantitative measure of the departure from the original model considered.",

      "title": "Twenty-first Century Lattice Gauge Theory: Results from the QCD Lagrangian",
      "summary": "Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) reduces the strong interactions, in all their variety, to a simple nonabelian gauge theory. It clearly and elegantly explains hadrons at short distances, which has led to its universal acceptance. Since its advent, however, many of its long-distance, emergent properties have been believed to be true, without having been demonstrated to be true. This paper reviews a variety of results in this regime that have been established with lattice gauge theory, directly from the QCD Lagrangian. This body of work sheds light on the origin of hadron masses, its interplay with dynamical symmetry breaking, as well as on other intriguing features such as the phase structure of QCD. In addition, nonperturbative QCD is quantitatively important to many aspects of particle physics (especially the quark flavor sector), nuclear physics, and astrophysics. This review also surveys some of the most interesting connections to those subjects.",

      "summary": "We calculate the quadratic fluctuations of net baryon number, electric charge and strangeness as well as correlations among these conserved charges in (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD at zero chemical potential. Results are obtained using calculations with tree level improved gauge and the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) actions with almost physical light and strange quark masses at three different values of the lattice cut-off. Our choice of parameters corresponds to a value of 160 MeV for the lightest pseudo scalar Goldstone mass and a physical value of the kaon mass. The three diagonal charge susceptibilities and the correlations among conserved charges have been extrapolated to the continuum limit in the temperature interval 150 MeV <T < 250 MeV. We compare our results with the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model calculations and find agreement with HRG model results only for temperatures T<= 150 MeV. We observe significant deviations in the temperature range 160 MeV < T < 170 MeV and qualitative differences in the behavior of the three conserved charge sectors. At T < 160 MeV quadratic net baryon number fluctuations in QCD agree with HRG model calculations while, the net electric charge fluctuations in QCD are about 10% smaller and net strangeness fluctuations are about 20% larger. These findings are relevant to the discussion of freeze-out conditions in relativistic heavy ion collisions.",

A technical oversight in the literature concerning the elastic contribution to Cottingham's formula is corrected and modern knowledge of the structure functions is used to precisely determine the inelastic contribution. We find δM_{p-n}^γ= 1.30(03)(47) MeV. The largest uncertainty arises from a subtraction term required in the dispersive analysis, which can be related to the isovector magnetic polarizability. With plausible model assumptions, we can combine our calculation with additional input from lattice QCD to constrain this polarizability as: β_{p-n} = -0.87(85) x 10^{-4} fm^3.",

We use the MILC ensembles of gauge configurations with 2+1 flavors of sea quarks at two lattice spacings of approximately 0.12 fm and 0.09 fm. We use the model-independent z-parametrization to extrapolate our simulation results at small recoil toward maximum recoil. Our results for the form-factor ratios are $f_0^{(s)}(M^2_π)/f_0^{(d)}(M^2_K) =1.046(44)_{stat.}(15)_{syst.}$ and $f_0^{(s)}(M^2_π)/f_0^{(d)}(M^2_π)=1.054(47)_{stat.}(17)_{syst.}$.

We study the SU(3) gauge theory with fermions for $N_f=12$ and 16 in fundamental representation. Both of them, through perturbation theory, reside in the conformal phase. We try to determine the phase of each theory non-perturbatively with lattice simulation and to find the characteristic behavior of the physical quantities in the phase. HISQ type staggered fermions are used to reduce the discretization error which could compromise the behavior of the physical quantity to determine the phase structure at non-zero lattice spacings. Spectral quantities such as bound state masses of meson channel and meson decay constants are investigated with careful finite volume analysis. Our data favor the conformal over chiral symmetry breaking scenario for both $N_f=12$ and 16.",

The new calculations improve on HPQCD's earlier work with NRQCD b-quarks by replacing AsqTad with HISQ valence quarks, by including a more chiral MILC fine ensemble in the analysis, and by employing better tuned quark masses and overall scale. We find f_B = 0.191(9)GeV, f_{B_s} = 0.228(10)GeV and f_{B_s}/f_B = 1.188(18). Combining the new value for f_{B_s}/f_B with a recent very precise determination of the B_s meson decay constant based on HISQ b-quarks, f_{B_s} = 0.225(4)GeV, leads to f_B = 0.189(4)GeV.

      "summary": "We present the first report of the LatKMI collaboration on the the lattice QCD simulation performed at the KMI computer, \"$\\varphi$\", for the cases of 4 flavors and 8 flavors, the latter being expected to be a candidate for the walking technicolor having an approximate scale invariance near the infrared fixed point. The simulation was carried out based on the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action. In this proceedings, we report preliminary results on the spectrum, analyzed through the chiral perturbation theory and the finite-size hyperscaling. We observe qualitatively different behavior of the 8-flavor case in contrast to the 4-flavor case which shows clear indication of the hadronic phase as in the usual QCD.",

      "summary": "We calculate the vacuum to meson matrix elements of the dimension-4 operator $\\barψγ_4\\nblr_i ψ$ and dimension-5 operator $\\barψ\\epsγ_jψB_k$ of the $1^{-+}$ meson on the lattice and compare them to the corresponding matrix elements of the ordinary mesons to discern if it is a hybrid. For the charmoniums and strange quarkoniums, we find that the matrix elements of $1^{-+}$ are comparable in size as compared to other known $q\\bar{q}$ mesons. They are particularly similar to those of the $2^{++}$ meson, since their dimension-4 operators are in the same Lorentz multiplet.\n  Based on these observations, we find no evidence to support the notion that the lowest $1^{-+}$ mesons in the $c\\bar{c}$ and $s\\bar{s}$ regions are hybrids. As for the exotic quantum number is concerned, the non-relativistic reduction reveals that the leading terms in the dimension-4 and dimension-5 operators of $1^{-+}$ are identical up to a proportional constant and it involves a center-of-mass momentum operator of the quark-antiquark pair. This explains why $1^{-+}$ is an exotic quantum number in the constituent quark model where the center of mass of the $q\\bar{q}$ is not a dynamical degree of freedom. Since QCD has gluon fields in the context of the flux-tube which is appropriate for heavy quarkoniums to allow the valence $q\\bar{q}$ to recoil against them, it can accommodate such states as $1^{-+}$. By the same token, hadronic models with additional constituents besides the quarks can also accommodate the $q\\bar{q}$ center-of-mass motion. To account for the quantum numbers of these $q\\bar{q}$ mesons in QCD and hadron models in the non-relativistic case, the parity and total angular momentum should be modified to $P = (-)^{L + l +1}$ and $\\vec{J} = \\vec{L} + \\vec{l} + \\vec{S}$, where $L$ is the orbital angular momentum of the $q\\bar{q}$ pair in the meson.",

We present methods based on Chebyshev interpolations and Cauchy theorem to find the (Fisher's) zeros of the partition function in the complex beta=1/g^2 plane. The results are consistent with reweighting methods whenever the latter are accurate. We discuss the volume dependence of the imaginary part of the Fisher's zeros, the width and depth of the plaquette distribution at the value of beta where the two peaks have equal height. We discuss strategies to discriminate between first and second order transitions and explore them with data at larger volume but lower statistics. Higher statistics and even larger lattices are necessary to draw strong conclusions regarding the order of the transition.",

We calculate the functional form of the corresponding B-parameters at next-to-leading order in both SU(3) and SU(2) staggered chiral perturbation theory (SChPT). Numerical results for these matrix elements are being generated using improved staggered fermions; our results can be used to extrapolate these matrix elements to the physical light and strange quark masses. The SU(3) SChPT results turn out to be much simpler than that for the Standard Model B_K operator, due to the absence of chiral suppression in the new operators. The SU(2) SChPT result is of similar simplicity to that for B_K. In fact, in the latter case, the chiral logarithms for two of the new B-parameters are identical to those for B_K, while those for the other two new B-parameters are of opposite sign. In addition to providing results for the 2+1 flavor theory in SU(3) SChPT and the 1+1+1 flavor theory in SU(2) SChPT, we present the corresponding continuum partially quenched results, as these are not available in the literature.",

The computations are done at lattice spacings of a \\approx 0.11 fm and a \\approx 0.08 fm, and the results demonstrate the improvement of rotational symmetry as a is reduced. A large lattice volume of (2.7 fm)^3 is used, and extrapolations of the bbb spectrum to realistic values of the light sea-quark masses are performed.

The extrapolations are based on the data from simulations on lattices with temporal extent Ntau=6, 8 and 12 with the HISQ/tree and Ntau=8 and 12 with the asqtad action. The chiral transition is analyzed in terms of universal O(N) scaling functions. After performing simultaneous asqtad and HISQ/tree continuum extrapolation the chiral transition temperature is Tc=154 +/- 9 MeV. We also discuss the deconfinement aspects of the transition in terms of the renormalized Polyakov loop, fluctuations and correlations of several conserved charges and the trace anomaly.",

      "summary": "Perturbative and non-perturbative results are presented on the renormalization constants of the quark field and the vector, axial-vector, pseudoscalar, scalar and tensor currents. The perturbative computation, carried out at one-loop level and up to second order in the lattice spacing, is performed for a fermion action, which includes the clover term and the twisted mass parameter yielding results that are applicable for unimproved Wilson fermions, as well as for improved clover and twisted mass fermions. We consider ten variants of the Symanzik improved gauge action corresponding to ten different values of the plaquette coefficients. Non-perturbative results are obtained using the twisted mass Wilson fermion formulation employing two degenerate dynamical quarks and the tree-level Symanzik improved gluon action. The simulations are performed for pion masses in the range of 480 MeV to 260 MeV and at three values of the lattice spacing, a, corresponding to beta=3.9, 4.05, 4.20. For each renormalization factor computed non-perturbatively we subtract its perturbative O(a^2) terms so that we eliminate part of the cut-off artifacts. The renormalization constants are converted to MS-bar at a scale of mu=2 GeV. The perturbative results depend on a large number of parameters and are made easily accessible to the reader by including them in the distribution package of this paper, as a Mathematica input file.",

      "summary": "The flavor-conserving non-leptonic weak interaction can be studied experimentally through the observation of parity violation in nuclear and few-body systems. At hadronic scales, matrix elements of parity-violating four-quark operators ultimately give rise to the parity violating couplings between hadrons, and such matrix elements can be calculated non-perturbatively using lattice QCD. In this work, we investigate the running of isovector parity-violating operators from the weak scale down to hadronic scales using the renormalization group. We work at next-to-leading order in the QCD coupling, and include both neutral-current and charged-current interactions. At this order, results are renormalization scheme dependent, and we utilize 't Hooft-Veltman dimensional regularization. The evolution of Wilson coefficients at leading and next-to-leading order is compared. Next-to-leading order effects are shown to be non-negligible at hadronic scales.",

      "summary": "We study corrections to the conformal hyperscaling relation in the conformal window of the large Nf QCD by using the ladder Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equation as a concrete dynamical model. From the analytical expression of the solution of the ladder SD equation, we identify the form of the leading mass correction to the hyperscaling relation. We find that the anomalous dimension, when identified through the hyperscaling relation neglecting these corrections, yields a value substantially lower than the one at the fixed point γ_m^* for large mass region. We further study finite-volume effects on the hyperscaling relation, based on the ladder SD equation in a finite space-time with the periodic boundary condition. We find that the finite-volume corrections on the hyperscaling relation are negligible compared with the mass correction. The anomalous dimension, when identified through the finite-size hyperscaling relation neglecting the mass corrections as is often done in the lattice analyses, yields almost the same value as that in the case of the infinite space-time neglecting the mass correction, i.e., a substantially lower value than γ_m^* for large mass. We also apply the finite-volume SD equation to the chiral-symmetry-breaking phase and find that when the theory is close to the critical point such that the dynamically generated mass is much smaller than the explicit breaking mass, the finite-size hyperscaling relation is still operative. We also suggest a concrete form of the modification of the finite-size hyperscaling relation by including the mass correction, which may be useful to analyze the lattice data.",

This calculation of the S-wave scattering length is related to the next-to-leading order corrections to WW scattering through the low-energy coefficients of the chiral Lagrangian. While two and six flavor scattering lengths are similar for a fixed ratio of the pseudoscalar mass to its decay constant, six-flavor scattering shows a somewhat less repulsive next-to-leading order interaction than its two-flavor counterpart. Estimates are made for the WW scattering parameters and the plausibility of detection is discussed.",

Using a large basis of composite QCD interpolating fields we extract an extensive spectrum of baryon states and isolate those of hybrid character using their relatively large overlap onto operators which sample gluonic excitations. We consider the spectrum of Nucleon and Delta states at several quark masses finding a set of positive parity hybrid baryons with quantum numbers N_1/2+, N_1/2+, N_3/2+, N_3/2+, N_5/2+ and Delta_1/2+, Delta_3/2+ at an energy scale above the first band of `conventional' excited positive parity baryons. This pattern of states is compatible with a color octet gluonic excitation having J^P=1+ as previously reported in the hybrid meson sector and with a comparable energy scale for the excitation, suggesting a common bound-state construction for hybrid mesons and baryons.",

      "summary": "The largest contribution to the CP violating K_L-K_S mixing parameter ε_K comes from second order weak interactions at short distances and can be accurately determined by a combination of electroweak perturbation theory and the calculation of the parameter B_K from lattice QCD. However, there is an additional long distance contribution to ε_K which is estimated to be of order 5%. Here recently introduced lattice techniques for computing the long-distance component of the K_L-K_S mass difference are generalized to this long-distance contribution to ε_K.",

      "summary": "Recently there has been some controversy in the literature concerning the existence of a fermion sign problem in the $\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills (SYM) theories on the lattice. In this work, we address this issue by conducting Monte Carlo simulations not only for $\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ but also for $\\mathcal{N}=(8,8)$ SYM in two dimensions for the U(N) theories with N=2, using the new ideas derived from topological twisting followed by geometric discretization. Our results from simulations provide the evidence that these theories do {\\it not} suffer from a sign problem as the continuum limit is approached. These results thus boost confidence that these new lattice formulations can be used successfully to explore the nonperturbative aspects of the four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory.",

      "summary": "We extend our previous study of the SU(3) gauge theory with N_f=2 flavors of fermions in the sextet representation of color. Our tool is the Schroedinger functional method. By changing the lattice action, we push the bulk transition of the lattice theory to stronger couplings and thus reveal the beta function and the mass anomalous dimension gamma_m over a wider range of coupling, out to g^2 ~ 11. Our results are consistent with an infrared fixed point, but walking is not ruled out. Our main result is that gamma_m never exceeds 0.45, making the model unsuitable for walking technicolor. We use a novel method of extrapolation to the large-volume/continuum limit, tailored to near-conformal theories.",

      "summary": "We present preliminary continuum results for light hadronic quantities obtained by the RBC/UKQCD collaboration using domain wall fermions with both the Iwasaki and the novel Dislocation Suppressing Determinant Ratio (DSDR) gauge actions. The DSDR action allows us to simulate at near physical quark masses on a larger, coarser lattice (a^-1 = 1.4 GeV, L = 4.6 fm) while retaining good chiral symmetry properties. We discuss our ongoing combined analysis of the three ensemble sets and give early results for the pion and kaon decay constants, quark masses and B_K.",
