      "title": "From C to Parton Sea: Bjorken-x Dependence of the PDFs",
      "summary": "Studying the structure of nucleons is not only important to understanding the strong interactions of quarks and gluons, but also to improving the precision of new-physics searches. Since a broad class of experiments, including the LHC and dark-matter detection, require Standard-Model backgrounds with parton distribution functions (PDFs) as inputs for disentangling SM contributions from potential new physics. For a long time, lattice calculations of the PDFs (as well as many hadron structures) has been limited to the first few moments. In this talk, we present a first direct calculation of the Bjorken-x dependence of the PDFs using Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET). An exploratory study of the antiquark/sea flavor asymmetry of these distributions will be discussed. This breakthrough opens an exciting new frontier calculating more complicated quantities, such as gluon structure and transverse-momentum dependence, which will complement existing theoretical programs for the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) or Large Hadron-Electron Collider (LHeC).",

Furthermore, we apply a newly proposed momentum improved smearing, which has the potential to reach higher nucleon momenta as required for a safe matching procedure to the physical distribution functions.",

      "summary": "The past decade has witnessed a dramatic acceleration of lattice quantum chromodynamics calculations in nuclear and particle physics. This has been due to both significant progress in accelerating the iterative linear solvers using multi-grid algorithms, and due to the throughput improvements brought by GPUs. Deploying hierarchical algorithms optimally on GPUs is non-trivial owing to the lack of parallelism on the coarse grids, and as such, these advances have not proved multiplicative. Using the QUDA library, we demonstrate that by exposing all sources of parallelism that the underlying stencil problem possesses, and through appropriate mapping of this parallelism to the GPU architecture, we can achieve high efficiency even for the coarsest of grids. Results are presented for the Wilson-Clover discretization, where we demonstrate up to 10x speedup over present state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated methods on Titan. Finally, we look to the future, and consider the software implications of our findings.",

      "title": "Strong isospin violation and chiral logarithms in the baryon spectrum",
      "summary": "We present a precise lattice QCD calculation of the contribution to the neutron-proton mass splitting arising from strong isospin breaking, $m_n-m_p|_{QCD}=2.32\\pm0.17$ MeV. We also determine $m_{Ξ^-} - m_{Ξ^0}|_{QCD} = 5.44\\pm0.31$ MeV. The calculation is performed at three values of the pion mass, with several values of the quark mass splitting and multiple lattice volumes, but only a single lattice spacing and an estimate of discretization errors. The calculations are performed on the anisotropic clover-Wilson ensembles generated by the Hadron Spectrum Collaboration. The omega-baryon mass is used to set the scale $a_t^{-1}=6111\\pm127$ MeV, while the kaon masses are used to determine the value of the light-quark mass spitting. The nucleon mass splitting is then determined as a function of the pion mass. We observe, for the first time, conclusive evidence for non-analytic light quark mass dependence in lattice QCD calculations of the baryon spectrum. When left as a free parameter, the fits prefer a nucleon axial coupling of $g_A=1.24(56)$. To highlight the presence of this chiral logarithm in the nucleon mass splitting, we also compute the isospin splitting in the cascade-baryon system which is less sensitive to chiral dynamics. Finally, we update the best lattice QCD determination of the CP-odd pion-nucleon coupling that would arise from a non-zero QCD theta-term, $\\bar{g}_0 / (\\sqrt{2}f_π) = (14.7\\pm1.8\\pm1.4) \\cdot 10^{-3} \\barθ$.\n  The original lattice QCD correlation functions, analysis results and extrapolated quantities are packaged in HDF5 files made publicly available including a simple Python script to access the numerical results, construct effective mass plots along with our analysis results, and perform the extrapolations of various quantities determined in this work.",

For the gradient and cooling scales we explore three different energy observables and two distinct reference values for the flow time. When the aim is to follow scaling towards the continuum limit, one gains at least a factor of 100 in computational efficiency by relying on the gradient instead of the deconfinement scale. Using cooling instead of the gradient flow one gains another factor of at least 34 in computational efficiency on the gradient flow part without any significant loss in the accuracy of scale setting. Concerning our observables, the message is to keep it simple. The Wilson action itself performs as well as or even better than the other two observables explored. Two distinct fitting forms for scaling are compared of which one connects to asymptotic scaling. Differences of the obtained estimates show that systematic errors of length ratios, though only about 1%, can be considerably larger than statistical errors of the same observables.",

      "summary": "The Feynman-Hellmann theorem can be derived from the long Euclidean-time limit of correlation functions determined with functional derivatives of the partition function. Using this insight, we fully develop an improved method for computing matrix elements of external currents utilizing only two-point correlation functions. Our method applies to matrix elements of any external bilinear current, including nonzero momentum transfer, flavor-changing, and two or more current insertion matrix elements. The ability to identify and control all the systematic uncertainties in the analysis of the correlation functions stems from the unique time dependence of the ground-state matrix elements and the fact that all excited states and contact terms are Euclidean-time dependent. We demonstrate the utility of our method with a calculation of the nucleon axial charge using gradient-flowed domain-wall valence quarks on the $N_f=2+1+1$ MILC highly improved staggered quark ensemble with lattice spacing and pion mass of approximately 0.15 fm and 310 MeV respectively. We show full control over excited-state systematics with the new method and obtain a value of $g_A = 1.213(26)$ with a quark-mass-dependent renormalization coefficient.",

      "summary": "We present the status of our formalism for extracting three-particle scattering observables from lattice QCD (LQCD). The method relies on relating the discrete finite-volume spectrum of a quantum field theory with its scattering amplitudes. As the finite-volume spectrum can be directly determined in LQCD, this provides a method for determining scattering observables, and associated resonance properties, from the underlying theory. In a pair of papers published over the last two years, two of us have extended this approach to apply to relativistic three-particle scattering states. In this talk we summarize recent progress in checking and further extending this result. We describe an extension of the formalism to include systems in which two-to-three transitions can occur. We then present a check of the previously published formalism, in which we reproduce the known finite-volume energy shift of a three-particle bound state.",

The excited-state contamination has been taken into account with three time separations between the source and sink. The improved axial charges $g_A^{3}(24I)=1.22(4)$ and $g_A^{3}(32I)=1.21(3)$ are obtained on a $24^3\\times 64$ lattice at pion mass of 330 MeV and a $32^3\\times 64$ lattice at pion mass 300 MeV are increased by $3.4\\%$ and $1.7\\%$ from their unimproved values, respectively.

By incorporating the gradient flow, this method guarantees that the lattice quasi PDFs are finite in the continuum limit and evades the thorny, and as yet unresolved, issue of the renormalization of quasi PDFs on the lattice. In the limit that the flow time is much smaller than the length scale set by the nucleon momentum, the moments of the smeared quasi PDF are proportional to those of the light-front PDF. We use this relation to derive evolution equations for the matching kernel that relates the smeared quasi PDF and the light-front PDF. As part of this discussion, we elucidate the relationship between the quasi and light-front PDFs.",

In various beyond-the-Standard Model scenarios nuclear and diamagnetic atomic EDMs are expected to be dominated by CP-violating pion-nucleon interactions that arise from quark chromo-electric dipole moments. The corresponding CP-violating pion-nucleon coupling strengths are, however, poorly known. In this work we propose a strategy to calculate these couplings by using spectroscopic lattice QCD techniques. Instead of directly calculating the pion-nucleon coupling constants, a challenging task, we use chiral symmetry relations that link the pion-nucleon couplings to nucleon sigma terms and mass splittings that are significantly easier to calculate. In this work, we show that these relations are reliable up to next-to-next-to-leading order in the chiral expansion in both SU(2) and SU(3) chiral perturbation theory. We conclude with a brief discussion about practical details regarding the required lattice QCD calculations and the phenomenological impact of an improved understanding of CP-violating matrix elements.",

      "summary": "Flavor-twisted boundary conditions can be used for exponential reduction of finite volume artifacts in flavor-averaged observables in lattice QCD calculations with $SU(N_f)$ light quark flavor symmetry. Finite volume artifact reduction arises from destructive interference effects in a manner closely related to the phase averaging which leads to large $N_c$ volume independence. With a particular choice of flavor-twisted boundary conditions, finite volume artifacts for flavor-singlet observables in a hypercubic spacetime volume are reduced to the size of finite volume artifacts in a spacetime volume with periodic boundary conditions that is four times larger.",

The calculation was performed with two different lattice spacings and includes one ensemble with a pion mass of 139(2) MeV. The resulting predictions for the $Λ_c \\to Λe^+ ν_e$ and $Λ_c \\to Λμ^+ ν_μ$ decay rates divided by $|V_{cs}|^2$ are $0.2007(71)(74)\\:{\\rm ps}^{-1}$ and $0.1945(69)(72)\\:{\\rm ps}^{-1}$, respectively, where the two uncertainties are statistical and systematic. Taking the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{cs}|$ from a global fit and the $Λ_c$ lifetime from experiments, this translates to branching fractions of $\\mathcal{B}(Λ_c\\toΛe^+ν_e)=0.0380(19)_{\\rm LQCD\\:\\:}(11)_{τ_{Λ_c}}$ and $\\mathcal{B}(Λ_c\\toΛμ^+ν_μ)=0.0369(19)_{\\rm LQCD\\:\\:}(11)_{τ_{Λ_c}}$. These results are consistent with, and two times more precise than, the measurements performed recently by the BESIII Collaboration.

We calculate the entanglement entropy in the superfluid phase of the O(2) model and show that it approximately obeys the logarithmic Calabrese-Cardy scaling obtained from Conformal Field Theory (CFT).

      "summary": "A systematic analysis of the structure of single-baryon correlation functions calculated with lattice QCD is performed, with a particular focus on characterizing the structure of the noise associated with quantum fluctuations. The signal-to-noise problem in these correlation functions is shown, as long suspected, to result from a sign problem. The log-magnitude and complex phase are found to be approximately described by normal and wrapped normal distributions respectively. Properties of circular statistics are used to understand the emergence of a large time noise region where standard energy measurements are unreliable. Power-law tails in the distribution of baryon correlation functions, associated with stable distributions and \"Levy flights\", are found to play a central role in their time evolution. A new method of analyzing correlation functions is considered for which the signal-to-noise ratio of energy measurements is constant, rather than exponentially degrading, with increasing source-sink separation time. This new method includes an additional systematic uncertainty that can be removed by performing an extrapolation, and the signal-to-noise problem re-emerges in the statistics of this extrapolation. It is demonstrated that this new method allows accurate results for the nucleon mass to be extracted from the large-time noise region inaccessible to standard methods. The observations presented here are expected to apply to quantum Monte Carlo calculations more generally. Similar methods to those introduced here may lead to practical improvements in analysis of noisier systems.",

      "summary": "We present high-statistics estimates of the isovector charges of the nucleon from four 2+1-flavor ensembles generated using Wilson-clover fermions with stout smearing and tree-level tadpole improved Symanzik gauge action at lattice spacings $a=0.114$ and $0.080$ fm and with $M_π\\approx 315$ and 200 MeV. The truncated solver method with bias correction and the coherent source sequential propagator construction are used to cost-effectively achieve $O(10^5)$ measurements on each ensemble. Using these data, the analysis of two-point correlation functions is extended to include four states in the fits and of three-point functions to three states. Control over excited-state contamination in the calculation of the nucleon mass, the mass gaps between excited states, and in the matrix elements is demonstrated by the consistency of estimates using this multistate analysis of the spectral decomposition of the correlation functions and from simulations of the three-point functions at multiple values of the source-sink separation. The results for all three charges, $g_A$, $g_S$ and $g_T$, are in good agreement with calculations done using the clover-on-HISQ lattice formulation with similar values of the lattice parameters.",

      "summary": "We construct a prototype BSM model based on the SU(3) color gauge group and a combination of 4 light (massless) and 8 heavy flavors. In the infrared, the SU(4) flavor chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, while in the ultraviolet this model exhibits the properties of the $N_f=12$ conformal fixed point. Renormalization group considerations predict the spectrum of such a system to show hyperscaling, i.e. dimensionless ratios of hadron masses or decay constants are independent of the heavy mass. Hyperscaling is present for bound states of light, heavy, or a combination of heavy and light flavors and leads to a strongly predictive model. Despite chiral symmetry breaking, this system features a spectrum exhibiting a very non-QCD like behavior. Furthermore, the gauge coupling becomes an irrelevant parameter. We support these expectations by presenting numerical results based on four different values of the heavy quark mass $am_h$, up to six different values of the light quark mass $am_\\ell$, and include, for the first time, preliminary data at a second value of the gauge coupling $β$. Our model can be embedded in scenarios describing the Higgs boson either as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson or a dilaton-like particle.",

We include data at six lattice spacings and several light sea-quark masses, including an approximately physical-mass ensemble at all but the smallest lattice spacing, 0.03 fm. This range of parameters provides excellent control of the continuum extrapolation to zero lattice spacing and of heavy-quark discretization errors. Finally, using the heavy-quark effective theory expansion we present a method of extracting from the same correlation functions the charm- and bottom-quark masses as well as some low-energy constants appearing in the heavy-quark expansion.",

Unlike HDCG \\cite{Boyle:2014rwa}, the algorithm works directly on a nearest neighbour fine operator. The fine operator used is Hermitian indefinite, for example $Γ_5 D_{dwf}$, and convergence is achieved with an indefinite matrix solver such as outer iteration based on conjugate residual. As a result coarse space representations of the operator remain nearest neighbour, giving an 8 point stencil rather than the 81 point stencil used in HDCG. It is hoped this may make it viable to recalculate the matrix elements of the little Dirac operator in an HMC evolution.",

We discuss the adiabatic preparation of the ground state at half-filling where we expect a CFT with c=1. This can be accomplished with a very small hoping parameter J, in contrast to existing studies with density one where a much larger J is needed. We provide two complementary methods to estimate and subtract the classical entropy generated by the experimental preparation and imaging processes. We compare numerical calculations for the classical O(2) model with a chemical potential on a 1+1 dimensional lattice, and the quantum Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian implemented in the experiments. S_2 is very similar for the two models and follows closely the Calabrese-Cardy scaling, (c/8)\\ln(N_s), for N_s sites with open boundary conditions, provided that the large subleading corrections are taken into account.",

      "summary": "We propose a novel general approach to locality of lattice composite fields, which in case of QCD involves locality in both quark and gauge degrees of freedom. The method is applied to gauge operators based on the overlap Dirac matrix elements, showing for the first time their local nature on realistic path-integral backgrounds. The framework entails a method for efficient evaluation of such non-ultralocal operators, whose computational cost is volume-indepenent at fixed accuracy, and only grows logarithmically as this accuracy approaches zero. This makes computation of useful operators, such as overlap-based topological density, practical. The key notion underlying these features is that of exponential insensitivity to distant fields, made rigorous by introducing the procedure of statistical regularization. The scales associated with insensitivity property are useful characteristics of non-local continuum operators.",

      "summary": "In QCD simulations at small lattice spacings, the topological charge Q evolves very slowly and, if this quantity is not properly equilibrated, we could get incorrect results for physical quantities, or incorrect estimates of their errors. We use the known relation between the dependence of masses and decay constants on the QCD vacuum angle theta and the squared topological charge Q^2 together with chiral perturbation theory results for the dependence of masses and decay constants on theta to estimate the size of these effects and suggest strategies for dealing with them. For the partially quenched case, we sketch an alternative derivation of the known $χ$PT results of Aoki and Fukaya, using the nonperturbatively correct chiral theory worked out by Golterman, Sharpe and Singleton, and by Sharpe and Shoresh. With the MILC collaboration's ensembles of lattices with four flavors of HISQ dynamical quarks, we measure the $Q^2$ dependence of masses and decay constants and compare to the $χ$PT forms. The observed agreement gives us confidence that we can reliably estimate the errors from slow topology change, and even correct for its leading effects.",

We first compute numerically the quark number density for imaginary chemical potential $iμ_{qI}$. Then we restore the grand canonical partition function for imaginary chemical potential using fitting procedure for the quark number density. Finally we compute the canonical partition functions using high precision numerical Fourier transformation. Additionally we compute the canonical partition functions using known method of the hopping parameter expansion and compare results obtained by two methods in the deconfining as well as in the confining phases. The agreement between two methods indicates the validity of the new method. Our numerical results are obtained in two flavor lattice QCD with clover improved Wilson fermions.",

      "summary": "QCD at finite quark-/baryon-number density, which describes nuclear matter, has a sign problem which prevents direct application of standard simulation methods based on importance sampling. When such finite density is implemented by the introduction of a quark-number chemical potential $μ$, this manifests itself as a complex fermion determinant. We apply simulations using the Complex Langevin Equation (CLE) which can be applied in such cases. However, this is not guaranteed to give correct results, so that extensive tests are required. In addition, gauge cooling is required to prevent runaway behaviour. We test these methods on 2-flavour lattice QCD at zero temperature on a small ($12^4$) lattice at an intermediate coupling $β=6/g^2=5.6$ and relatively small quark mass $m=0.025$, over a range of $μ$ values from $0$ to saturation. While this appears to show the correct phase structure with a phase transition at $μ\\approx m_N/3$ and a saturation density of $3$ at large $μ$, the observables show departures from known values at small $μ$. We are now running on a larger lattice ($16^4$) at weaker coupling $β=5.7$. At $μ=0$ this significantly improves agreement between measured observables and known values, and there is some indication that this continues to small $μ$s. This leads one to hope that the CLE might produce correct results in the weak-coupling -- continuum -- limit.",

Comparison of the two approaches provides an important cross-check of methodologies in lattice QCD.

We present some results on sixth order cumulants entering the calculation of the QCD equation of state at non-zero values of the baryon chemical potential (mu_B) and discuss limitations on the applicability of HRG thermodynamics deduced from a comparison between QCD and HRG model calculations of cumulants of conserved charge fluctuations.

Recently developed methods for $1\\to2$ transition matrix elements in a finite volume now enable the determination of radiative decay rates of strongly unstable particles. Our lattice QCD study focuses on the process $ππ\\to πγ^{*}$, where the $ρ$ meson is present as an enhancement in the cross-section. We use $2+1$ flavors of clover fermions at a pion mass of approximately $320$ MeV and a lattice size of approximately $3.6$ fm. The required $2$-point and $3$-point correlation functions are constructed from a set of forward, sequential and stochastic light quark propagators. In addition to determining the $ρ$ meson resonance parameters via the Lüscher method, the scattering phase shift is used in conjunction with the $1\\to2$ transition matrix element formalism of Briceño, Hansen and Walker-Loud to compute the $ππ\\toπγ^{*}$ amplitude at several values of the momentum transfer and $ππ$ invariant mass.",

We believe the existence of the critical point suggests a new mechanism for generating fermion masses. In this work we begin the search for this quantum critical point in 4D by extending the 3D model to 4D. Unlike in 3D, now we do find evidence for an intermediate spontaneously broken phase (FM phase) and are able compute the phase boundaries accurately. In terms of the bare coupling, the width of the intermediate region appears to be quite small.",

Using an nHYP-smeared staggered lattice action and an improved gradient flow running coupling $\\tilde g_c^2(L)$ we determine the continuum-extrapolated discrete beta function up to $g_c^2 \\approx 8.2$. We observe an IR fixed point at $g_{\\star}^2 = 7.3\\left(_{-2}^{+8}\\right)$ in the $c = \\sqrt{8t} / L = 0.25$ scheme, and $g_{\\star}^2 = 7.3\\left(_{-3}^{+6}\\right)$ with c=0.3, combining statistical and systematic uncertainties in quadrature. The systematic effects we investigate include the stability of the $(a / L) \\to 0$ extrapolations, the interpolation of $\\tilde g_c^2(L)$ as a function of the bare coupling, the improvement of the gradient flow running coupling, and the discretization of the energy density. In an appendix we observe that the resulting systematic errors increase dramatically upon combining smaller $c \\lesssim 0.2$ with smaller $L \\leq 12$, leading to an IR fixed point at $g_{\\star}^2 = 5.9(1.9)$ in the c=0.2 scheme, which resolves to $g_{\\star}^2 = 6.9\\left(_{-1}^{+6}\\right)$ upon considering only $L \\geq 16$. At the IR fixed point we measure the leading irrelevant critical exponent to be $γ_g^{\\star} = 0.26(2)$, comparable to perturbative estimates.",

We present numerical evidences from our lattice simulations using dynamical overlap as well as Wilson-Dirac fermions for the absence of bilinear condensate for any even number of flavors of two-component fermions. Instead, we find evidences for the scale-invariant nature of three-dimensional QED.",

Care is taken so the construction applies to any smooth D-dimensional Riemannian manifold that permits a spin connection. It is tested numerically in 2D for the projective sphere ${\\mathbb S}^2$ in the limit of an increasingly refined sequence of triangles. The eigenspectrum and eigenvectors are shown to converge rapidly to the exact result in the continuum limit. In addition comparison is made with the continuum Ising conformal field theory on ${\\mathbb S}^2$.

      "title": "Light flavor-singlet scalars and walking signals in $N_f=8$ QCD on the lattice",
      "summary": "Based on the highly improved staggered quark action, we perform lattice simulations of $N_f=8$ QCD and confirm our previous observation of a flavor-singlet scalar meson (denoted as $σ$) as light as the pion and various \"walking signals\" through low-lying spectra, with higher statistics, smaller fermion masses $m_f$, and larger volumes. We measure $M_π$, $F_π$, $M_ρ$, $M_{a_0}$, $M_{a_1}$, $M_{b_1}$, $M_N$, $M_σ$, $F_σ$, $\\langle \\barψ ψ\\rangle$ (both directly and through the GMOR relation), and the string tension. The data are consistent with the spontaneously broken phase of the chiral symmetry, in agreement with the previous results: ratios of the quantities to $M_π$ monotonically increase in the smaller $m_f$ region towards the chiral limit similarly to $N_f=4$ QCD, in sharp contrast to $N_f=12$ QCD where the ratios become flattened. The hyperscaling relation holds with roughly a universal value of the anomalous dimension, $γ_m \\simeq 1$, with a notable exception of $M_π$ with $γ_m \\simeq 0.6$ as in the previous results. This is a salient feature (\"walking signal\") of $N_f=8$, unlike either $N_f=4$ which has no hyperscaling relation at all, or $N_f=12$ QCD which exhibits universal hyperscaling. We further confirm the previous observation of the light $σ$ with mass comparable to the pion in the studied $m_f$ region. In a chiral limit extrapolation of the $σ$ mass using the dilaton chiral perturbation theory and also using the simple linear fit, we find the value consistent with the 125 GeV Higgs boson within errors. Our results suggest that the theory could be a good candidate for walking technicolor model, having anomalous dimension $γ_m \\simeq 1$ and a light flavor-singlet scalar meson as a technidilaton, which can be identified with the 125 GeV composite Higgs in $N_f=8$ one-family model.",

      "summary": "The nuclear matrix element determining the $pp\\to d e^+ ν$ fusion cross section and the Gamow-Teller matrix element contributing to tritium $β$-decay are calculated with lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) for the first time. Using a new implementation of the background field method, these quantities are calculated at the SU(3)-flavor-symmetric value of the quark masses, corresponding to a pion mass of $m_π$ ~ 806 MeV. The Gamow-Teller matrix element in tritium is found to be 0.979(03)(10) at these quark masses, which is within $2σ$ of the experimental value. Assuming that the short-distance correlated two-nucleon contributions to the matrix element (meson-exchange currents) depend only mildly on the quark masses, as seen for the analogous magnetic interactions, the calculated $pp\\to d e^+ ν$ transition matrix element leads to a fusion cross section at the physical quark masses that is consistent with its currently accepted value. Moreover, the leading two-nucleon axial counterterm of pionless effective field theory is determined to be $L_{1,A}=3.9(0.1)(1.0)(0.3)(0.9)\\ {\\rm fm}^3$ at a renormalization scale set by the physical pion mass, also in agreement with the accepted phenomenological range. This work concretely demonstrates that weak transition amplitudes in few-nucleon systems can be studied directly from the fundamental quark and gluon degrees of freedom and opens the way for subsequent investigations of many important quantities in nuclear physics.",

Furthermore, we apply momentum smearing for the relevant matrix elements to compute the lattice PDFs and find a large improvement factor when compared to conventional Gaussian smearing.

This method permits the computation of not only the values of matrix elements at momenta accessible on the lattice, but also the momentum-space derivatives, providing {\\it a priori} information about the $Q^2$ dependence of form factors. As a specific application we use the method, at a single lattice spacing and with unphysically heavy quarks, to directly obtain the slope of the isovector form factor at various $Q^2$, whence the isovector charge radius. The method has potential application in the calculation of any hadronic matrix element with momentum transfer, including those relevant to hadronic weak decays.",

      "summary": "The precision reached by recent lattice QCD results allows for the first time to investigate whether the measured hadronic spectrum is missing some additional strange states, which are predicted by the Quark Model but have not yet been detected. This can be done by comparing some sensitive thermodynamic observables from lattice QCD to the predictions of the Hadron Resonance Gas model (with the inclusion of decays [3]). We propose a set of specific observables, defined as linear combinations of conserved charge fluctuations, which allow to investigate this issue for baryons containing one or more strange quarks separately. Applications of these observables to isolate the multiplicity fluctuations of kaons from lattice QCD, and their comparison with the experimental results, are also discussed.",

      "summary": "We study a lattice model comprising four massless reduced staggered fermions in four dimensions coupled through an $SU(4)$-invariant four-fermion interaction. We present both theoretical arguments and numerical evidence that no bilinear fermion condensates are present for any value of the four-fermi coupling, in contrast to earlier studies of Higgs--Yukawa models with different exact lattice symmetries. At strong coupling we observe the formation of a four-fermion condensate and a mass gap in spite of the absence of bilinear condensates. Unlike those previously studied systems we do not find a ferromagnetic phase separating this strong-coupling phase from the massless weak-coupling phase. Instead we observe long-range correlations in a narrow region of the coupling, still with vanishing bilinear condensates. While our numerical results come from relatively small lattice volumes that call for caution in drawing conclusions, if this novel phase structure is verified by future investigations employing larger volumes it may offer the possibility for new continuum limits for strongly interacting fermions in four dimensions.",

      "summary": "Recent developments showed that hadron light-cone parton distributions could be directly extracted from spacelike correlators, known as quasi parton distributions, in the large hadron momentum limit. Unlike the normal light-cone parton distribution, a quasi parton distribution contains ultraviolet (UV) power divergence associated with the Wilson line self energy. We show that to all orders in the coupling expansion, the power divergence can be removed by a \"mass\" counterterm in the auxiliary $z$-field formalism, in the same way as the renormalization of power divergence for an open Wilson line. After adding this counterterm, the quasi quark distribution is improved such that it contains at most logarithmic divergences. Based on a simple version of discretized gauge action, we present the one-loop matching kernel between the improved non-singlet quasi quark distribution with a lattice regulator and the corresponding quark distribution in dimensional regularization.",

We show that the inclusion of the higher Fock components $\\ket {qqqq\\bar{q}}$ has a significant effect on the spin-flip elastic Pauli form factor and almost zero effect on the spin-conserving Dirac form factor. We present light-front holographic QCD results for the proton and neutron form factors at any momentum transfer range, including asymptotic predictions, and show that our results agree with the available experimental data with high accuracy. In order to correctly describe the Pauli form factor we need an admixture of a five quark state of about 30$\\%$ in the proton and about 40$\\%$ in the neutron. We also extract the nucleon charge and magnetic radii and perform a flavor decomposition of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors. The free parameters needed to describe the experimental nucleon form factors are very few: two parameters for the probabilities of higher Fock states for the spin-flip form factor and a phenomenological parameter $r$, required to account for possible SU(6) spin-flavor symmetry breaking effects in the neutron, whereas the Pauli form factors are normalized to the experimental values of the anomalous magnetic moments. The covariant spin structure for the Dirac and Pauli nucleon form factors prescribed by AdS$_5$ semiclassical gravity incorporates the correct twist scaling behavior from hard scattering and also leads to vector dominance at low energy.",

The glue spin $S_{G}$ in the Coulomb gauge in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme is obtained with the 1-loop perturbative matching. We find the results fairly insensitive to lattice spacing and quark masses. We also find that the proton momentum dependence of $S_G$ in the range $0\\leq |\\vec{p}| < 1.5$ GeV is very mild, and we determine it in the large momentum limit to be $S_{G}=0.251(47)(16)$ at the physical pion mass in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme at $μ^2=10$ GeV$^2$. If the matching procedure in large momentum effective theory is neglected, $S_G$ is equal to the glue helicity measured in high-energy scattering experiments.",

      "summary": "Lattice QCD calculations with background magnetic fields are used to determine the magnetic moments of the octet baryons. Computations are performed at the physical value of the strange quark mass, and two values of the light quark mass, one corresponding to the three-flavor symmetric point, where the pion mass is 800 MeV, and the other corresponding to a pion mass of 450 MeV. The moments are found to exhibit only mild pion-mass dependence when expressed in terms of appropriately chosen magneton units- the natural baryon magneton. A curious pattern is revealed among the anomalous baryon magnetic moments which is linked to the constituent quark model, however, careful scrutiny exposes additional features. Relations expected to hold in the large-Nc limit of QCD are studied; and, in one case, a clear preference for the quark model over the large-Nc prediction is found. The magnetically coupled Lambda-Sigma system is treated in detail at the three-flavor symmetric point, with the lattice QCD results comparing favorably with predictions based on SU(3)F symmetry. This analysis enables the first extraction of the isovector transition magnetic polarizability. The possibility that large magnetic fields stabilize strange matter is explored, but such a scenario is found to be unlikely.",

For the first time, the full set of relevant four-quark operators is renormalised non-perturbatively through RI-SMOM schemes; a detailed description of the renormalisation procedure is presented in a companion paper.

      "summary": "Many theories describing physics beyond the Standard Model rely on a large separation of scales. Large scale separation arises in models with mass-split flavors if the system is conformal in the ultraviolet but chirally broken in the infrared. Because of the conformal fixed point, these systems exhibit hyperscaling and a highly constrained resonance spectrum. We derive hyperscaling relations and investigate the realization of one such system with four light and eight heavy flavors. Our numerical simulations confirm that both light-light and heavy-heavy resonance masses show hyperscaling and depend only on the ratio of the light and heavy flavor masses. The heavy-heavy spectrum is qualitatively different from QCD and exhibits quarkonia with masses not proportional to the constituent quark mass. These resonances are only a few times heavier than the light-light ones, which would put them within reach of the LHC.",

In this talk we would like to report on recent non-perturbative results and ongoing efforts to explore the proton spin from lattice QCD. We present results for the relevant generalized form factors from gauge field ensembles that feature a physical value of the pion mass. These generalized form factors can be used to determine the total spin and angular momentum carried by the quarks. In addition we present first results for our ongoing effort to compute the angular momentum of the gluons in the proton.",

      "summary": "Experimental results for mesonic $b \\to s μ^+ μ^-$ decays show a pattern of deviations from Standard-Model predictions, which could be due to new fundamental physics or due to an insufficient understanding of hadronic effects. Additional information on the $b \\to s μ^+ μ^-$ transition can be obtained from $Λ_b$ decays. This was recently done using the process $Λ_b \\to Λμ^+ μ^-$, where the $Λ$ is the lightest strange baryon. A further interesting channel is $Λ_b \\to p^+ K^- μ^+ μ^-$, where the $p^+ K^-$ final state receives contributions from multiple higher-mass $Λ$ resonances. The narrowest and most prominent of these is the $Λ(1520)$, which has $J^P=\\frac32^-$. Here we present an ongoing lattice QCD calculation of the relevant $Λ_b \\to Λ(1520)$ form factors. We discuss the choice of interpolating field for the $Λ(1520)$, and explain our method for extracting the fourteen $Λ_b \\to Λ(1520)$ helicity form factors from correlation functions that are computed in the $Λ(1520)$ rest frame. We present preliminary numerical results at a pion mass of 340 MeV and a lattice spacing of 0.11 fm. This calculation uses a domain-wall action for the $u$, $d$, and $s$ quarks and a relativistic heavy-quark action for the $b$ quark, and is based on gauge-field configurations generated by the RBC and UKQCD Collaborations.",

This scheme has properties similar to those of the SMOM scheme, such as the use of non-exceptional symmetric momenta, while in contrast to SMOM, it defines the renormalized fields away from the chiral limit. Here we discuss some of the properties of mSMOM, and present non-perturbative arguments for deriving some renormalization constants. The results of a 1-loop calculation in dimensional regularization are briefly summarised to illustrate some properties of the scheme.",

      "summary": "The rare decays of a kaon into a pion and a charged lepton/antilepton pair proceed via a flavour changing neutral current and therefore may only be induced beyond tree level in the Standard Model. This natural suppression makes these decays sensitive to the effects of potential New Physics. The CP conserving $K\\toπ\\ell^+\\ell^-$ decay channels however are dominated by a single photon exchange; this involves a sizeable long-distance hadronic contribution which represents the current major source of theoretical uncertainty. Here we outline our methodology for the computation of the long-distance contributions to these rare decay amplitudes using lattice QCD and present the numerical results of the first exploratory studies of these decays in which all but the disconnected diagrams are evaluated. The domain wall fermion ensembles of the RBC and UKQCD collaborations are used, with a pion mass of $M_π\\sim 430\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ and a kaon mass of $M_{K}\\sim 625\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$. In particular we determine the form factor, $V(z)$, of the $K^+\\toπ^+\\ell^+\\ell^-$ decay from the lattice at small values of $z=q^2/M_{K}^{2}$, obtaining $V(z)=1.37(36),\\, 0.68(39),\\, 0.96(64)$ for the three values of $z=-0.5594(12),\\, -1.0530(34),\\, -1.4653(82)$ respectively.",

We first map the model into a repulsive Hubbard model of spin-half fermions hopping on three independent one dimensional chains that interact through a triangular hopping at one end. We then convert the fermion model into an inhomogeneous one dimensional model and express the partition function as a weighted sum over fermion worldline configurations. By imposing a pairing of fermion worldlines in half the space we show that all negative weight configurations can be eliminated. This pairing naturally leads to the original frustrated quantum spin model at half filling and thus solves its sign problem.",

Lepton number-violating neutrinoless double beta decay is a natural consequence of Majorana neutrinos and many BSM theories, and many experimental efforts are involved in the search for these processes. Understanding how neutrinoless double beta decay would manifest in nuclear environments is key for understanding any observed signals. In these proceedings we present an overview of a set of one- and two-body matrix elements relevant for experimental searches for neutrinoless double beta decay, describe the role of lattice QCD calculations, and present preliminary lattice QCD results.",

Our fully nonperturbative calculation uses methods of lattice gauge theory to study the theory using a hybrid Monte Carlo approach. We investigate the phenomenon of magnetic catalysis in the context of graphene by studying the chiral condensate which is the order parameter characterizing the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. In the EFT, the symmetry breaking pattern is given by $U(4) \\to U(2) \\times U(2)$. We also comment on the difficulty, in this lattice formalism, of studying the time-reversal-odd condensate characterizing the ground state in the presence of a magnetic field.

      "summary": "We report new results on the conformal properties of an important strongly coupled gauge theory, a building block of composite Higgs models beyond the Standard Model. With twelve massless fermions in the fundamental representation of the SU(3) color gauge group, an infrared fixed point of the $β$-function was recently reported in the theory (Cheng:2014jba) with uncertainty in the location of the critical gauge coupling inside the narrow $[ 6.0<g_*^2<6.4]$ interval and widely accepted since as the strongest evidence for a conformal fixed point and scale invariance in the theory with model-building implications. Using the exact same renormalization scheme as the previous study, we show that no fixed point of the $β$-function exists in the reported interval. Our findings eliminate the only seemingly credible evidence for conformal fixed point and scale invariance in the $N_f=12$ model whose infrared properties remain unresolved. The implications of the recently completed 5-loop QCD beta function for arbitrary flavor number are discussed with respect to our work.",

Hadronic correlation functions are computed including all required quark propagation diagrams, and from these the discrete spectrum of states in the finite volume defined by the lattice boundary is extracted. From the volume dependence of the spectrum we obtain the $S$-wave phase-shift up to the $K\\overline{K}$ threshold. Calculations are performed at two values of the $u,d$ quark mass corresponding to $m_π= 236, 391$ MeV and the resulting amplitudes are described in terms of a $σ$ meson which evolves from a bound-state below $ππ$ threshold at the heavier quark mass, to a broad resonance at the lighter quark mass.",

Using lattice gauge theory, a nonperturbative analysis of the theory of strongly-interacting, massless, (2+1)-dimensional Dirac fermions in the presence of an external magnetic field is performed. We show that in the zero-temperature limit, a nonzero value for the chiral condensate is obtained which signals the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. This result implies a nonzero value for the dynamical mass of the Dirac quasiparticle. This in turn has been posited to account for the quantum-Hall plateaus that are observed at large magnetic fields.",

While the scaling factor $a_2$ is a ratio of nuclear matrix elements that individually depend on the calculational scheme, we show that the ratio is independent of this choice. We perform Green's function Monte Carlo calculations with both chiral and Argonne-Urbana potentials to verify this and determine the scaling factors for light nuclei. The resulting values for $^3$He and $^4$He are in good agreement with experimental values. We also present results for $^9$Be and $^{12}$C extracted from variational Monte Carlo calculations.",

By means of the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model, we calculate the actual kaon second-to-first fluctuation ratio, which receives contribution from primordial kaons and resonance decays, and show that it is very close to the one obtained for primordial kaons in the Boltzmann approximation. The latter only involves the strangeness and electric charge chemical potentials, which are functions of $T$ and $μ_B$ due to the experimental constraint on strangeness and electric charge, and can therefore be calculated on the lattice. This provides an unambiguous method to extract the kaon freeze-out temperature, by comparing the lattice results to the experimental values for the corresponding fluctuations.",

Furthermore, we describe the results obtained on the lattice for some of the low-energy constants of SU(2)LxSU(2)R and SU(3)LxSU(3)R Chiral Perturbation Theory. We review the determination of the BK parameter of neutral kaon mixing as well as the additional four B parameters that arise in theories of physics beyond the Standard Model. The latter quantities are an addition compared to the previous review. For the heavy-quark sector, we provide results for mc and mb (also new compared to the previous review), as well as those for D- and B-meson decay constants, form factors, and mixing parameters. These are the heavy-quark quantities most relevant for the determination of CKM matrix elements and the global CKM unitarity-triangle fit.

      "summary": "We study the finite volume effects on the electric polarizability for the neutron, neutral pion, and neutral kaon using eight dynamically generated two-flavor nHYP-clover ensembles at two different pion masses: 306(1) and 227(2) MeV. An infinite volume extrapolation is performed for each hadron at both pion masses. For the neutral kaon, finite volume effects are relatively mild. The dependence on the quark mass is also mild and a reliable chiral extrapolation can be performed along with the infinite volume extrapolation. Our result is $α_{K^0}^\\mbox{phys}=0.356(74) \\times 10^{-4} \\mbox{fm}^3$. In contrast, for neutron the electric polarizability depends strongly on the volume. After removing the finite volume corrections, our neutron polarizability results are in good agreement with $χ$PT. For the connected part of the neutral pion polarizability, the negative trend persists, and it is not due to finite volume effects, but likely sea quark charging effects.",

      "summary": "A picture of confinement in QCD based on a condensate of thick vortices with fluxes in the center of the gauge group (center vortices) is studied. Previous concrete model realizations of this picture utilized a hypercubic space-time scaffolding, which, together with many advantages, also has some disadvantages, e.g., in the treatment of vortex topological charge. In the present work, we explore a center vortex model which does not rely on such a scaffolding. Vortices are represented by closed random lines in continuous 2+1-dimensional space-time. These random lines are modeled as being piece-wise linear, and an ensemble is generated by Monte Carlo methods. The physical space in which the vortex lines are defined is a torus with periodic boundary conditions. Besides moving, growing and shrinking of the vortex configurations, also reconnections are allowed. Our ensemble therefore contains not a fixed, but a variable number of closed vortex lines. This is expected to be important for realizing the deconfining phase transition. We study both vortex percolation and the potential V (R) between quark and anti-quark as a function of distance R at different vortex densities, vortex segment lengths, reconnection conditions and at different temperatures. We find three deconfinement phase transitions, as a function of density, as a function of vortex segment length, and as a function of temperature.",

The finite lattice spacing and finite volume corrections are included in a global fit with $24$ valence quark masses on four lattices with different lattice spacings, different volumes, and four sea quark masses including one at the physical pion mass. We obtain the strange magnetic moment $G^s_M(0) = - 0.064(14)(09)\\, μ_N$. The four-sigma precision in statistics is achieved partly due to low-mode averaging of the quark loop and low-mode substitution to improve the statistics of the nucleon propagator.

      "summary": "We present results for the isovector axial, scalar and tensor charges $g^{u-d}_A$, $g^{u-d}_S$ and $g^{u-d}_T$ of the nucleon needed to probe the Standard Model and novel physics. The axial charge is a fundamental parameter describing the weak interactions of nucleons. The scalar and tensor charges probe novel interactions at the TeV scale in neutron and nuclear $β$-decays, and the flavor-diagonal tensor charges $g^{u}_T$, $g^{d}_T$ and $g^{s}_T$ are needed to quantify the contribution of the quark electric dipole moment (EDM) to the neutron EDM. The 9 ensembles, generated by the MILC Collaboration using the HISQ action with 2+1+1 dynamical flavors, span three lattice spacings $a \\approx 0.06, 0.09$ and 0.12 fm and light-quark masses corresponding to the pion masses $M_π\\approx 135, 225$ and 315 MeV. High-statistics estimates on five ensembles using the all-mode-averaging method allow us to quantify all systematic uncertainties and perform a simultaneous extrapolation in the lattice spacing, lattice volume and light-quark masses for the connected contributions. Our final estimates, in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme at 2 GeV, of the isovector charges are $g_A^{u-d} = 1.195(33)(20)$, $g_S^{u-d} = 0.97(12)(6) $ and $g_T^{u-d} = 0.987(51)(20)$. The first error includes statistical and all systematic uncertainties except that due to the extrapolation Ansatz, which is given by the second error estimate. Combining our estimate for $g_S^{u-d}$ with the difference of light quarks masses $(m_d-m_u)^{\\rm QCD}=2.67(35)$ MeV given by FLAG, we obtain $(M_N-M_P)^{\\rm QCD} = 2.59(49)$ MeV. Estimates of the connected part of the flavor-diagonal tensor charges of the proton are $g^{u}_T=0.792(42)$ and $g^{d}_T=-0.194(14)$. Combining our new estimates with precision low-energy experiments, we update constraints on novel scalar and tensor interactions, $ε_{S,T}$, at the TeV scale.",

This less explored mechanism of fermion mass generation is responsible for making four reduced staggered lattice fermions massive at strong couplings in a lattice model with a local four-fermion coupling. The model has a massless fermion phase at weak couplings and a massive fermion phase at strong couplings. In particular there is no spontaneous symmetry breaking of any lattice symmetries in both these phases. Recently it was discovered that in three space-time dimensions there is a direct second order phase transition between the two phases. Here we study the same model in four space-time dimensions and find results consistent with the existence of a narrow intermediate phase with fermion bilinear condensates, that separates the two asymptotic phases by continuous phase transitions.",

This structure function only exists for targets of spin $J\\ge1$ and does not mix with quark distributions at leading twist, thereby providing a particularly clean probe of gluonic degrees of freedom. We also explore the gluonic analogue of the Soffer bound which relates the helicity flip and non-flip gluonic distributions, finding it to be saturated at the level of 80%.

The eigenvectors associated with these low-lying eigenvalues suggest critical behavior in the sense of a metal-insulator transition. We show that there is no mass gap in the scalar and vector correlators in the infinite volume theory. The vector correlator does not acquire an anomalous dimension.

      "summary": "A relativistic Bose gas at finite density suffers from a sign problem that makes direct numerical simulations not feasible. One possible solution to the sign problem is to re-express the path integral in terms of Lefschetz thimbles. Using this approach we study the relativistic Bose gas both in the symmetric phase (low-density) and the spontaneously broken phase (high-density). In the high-density phase we break explicitly the symmetry and determine the dependence of the order parameter on the breaking. We study the relative contributions of the dominant and sub-dominant thimbles in this phase. We find that the sub-dominant thimble only contributes substantially when the explicit symmetry breaking is small, a regime that is dominated by finite volume effects. In the regime relevant for the thermodynamic limit, this contribution is negligible.",

      "summary": "We demonstrate the applicability of a recently proposed multiscale thermalization algorithm to two-color quantum chromodynamics (QCD) with two mass-degenerate fermion flavors. The algorithm involves refining an ensemble of gauge configurations that had been generated using a renormalization group (RG) matched coarse action, thereby producing a fine ensemble that is close to the thermalized distribution of a target fine action; the refined ensemble is subsequently rethermalized using conventional algorithms. Although the generalization of this algorithm from pure Yang-Mills theory to QCD with dynamical fermions is straightforward, we find that in the latter case, the method is susceptible to numerical instabilities during the initial stages of rethermalization when using the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. We find that these instabilities arise from large fermion forces in the evolution, which are attributed to an accumulation of spurious near-zero modes of the Dirac operator. We propose a simple strategy for curing this problem, and demonstrate that rapid thermalization--as probed by a variety of gluonic and fermionic operators--is possible with the use of this solution. In addition, we study the sensitivity of rethermalization rates to the RG matching of the coarse and fine actions, and identify effective matching conditions based on a variety of measured scales.",

The algorithm generates the spectral density of the lattice Dirac operator as a continuous function over all scales of the complete eigenvalue spectrum. This is distinct from an earlier method where the integrated spectral density (mode number) was calculated efficiently for some preselected fixed range of the integration. The new algorithm allows global studies like the chiral condensate from the Dirac spectrum at any scale including the cutoff-dependent IR and UV range of the spectrum. Physics applications include the scale-dependent mass anomalous dimension, spectral representation of composite fermion operators, and the crossover transition from the $ε$-regime of Random Matrix Theory to the p-regime in chiral perturbation theory. We present thorough tests of the algorithm in the 2-flavor sextet SU(3) gauge theory that we continue to pursue for its potential as a minimal realization of the composite Higgs scenario.",

In this letter, we present a new method to compute real time quantities on the lattice using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism via Monte Carlo simulations. The key idea is to deform the path integration domain to a complex manifold where the phase oscillations are mild and the sign problem is manageable. We use the previously introduced \"contraction algorithm\" to create a Markov chain on this alternative manifold. We substantiate our approach by analyzing the quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator. Our results are in agreement with the exact ones obtained by diagonalization of the Hamiltonian.

We present a position space method that allows us to remove the momentum prefactor in the form factor decomposition and hence compute the magnetic form factor directly at zero momentum without the need to assume a functional form for its momentum dependence. The method is explored on one ensemble using $N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson twisted mass fermions with a light quark mass corresponding to $M_π\\approx373\\mathrm{GeV}$ and a lattice spacing of $a\\approx0.082\\mathrm{fm}$. We obtain results for the isovector magnetic moment and for the proton and neutron magnetic moments. The value we find for the isovector magnetic moment is larger as compared to fitting the form factor at the discrete values of the lattice momentum transfers using a dipole Ansatz, bringing it closer to the experimental value.",

      "summary": "Semileptonic and purely leptonic decays of B meson to $τ$, such as $B\\to D^{(\\ast)}τν_τ$ and $B\\toτν_τ$ are studied. Recognizing that there already were some weak hints of possible deviations from the SM in the measurements of $\\mathcal{B}(B\\toτν_τ)$ by \\Babar~and Belle and the fact that detection of the $τ$ also occurs in the measurements of $B\\to D^{(\\ast)}τν_τ$, we stress the importance of joint studies of these processes, whenever possible. For this purpose, as an illustration, we introduce the observable, $\\mathcal{R}(D^{(*)})/\\mathcal{B}(B\\toτν_τ)$ where, for one thing, the unknown systematics due to $τ$ identification are expected to largely cancel. We show that all measurements of this observable are consistent with the existing data, within somewhat largish experimental errors, with the predictions of the SM. We stress that precise experimental measurement and comparison with theory of the branching ratio for $B \\to τν_τ$ is extremely important for a reliable search of new physics. Furthermore, in view of the anticipated improved precision in experiments in the next few years, in addition to $\\mathcal{R}(D^{(*)})$, host of other ratios analogous to $\\mathcal{R}(D^{(*)})/\\mathcal{B}(B \\to τν_τ)$ in the SM are suggested for lattice calculations as well, so that for more stringent tests of the SM, correlations in lattice calculations can be properly taken into account to enhance precision.",

      "summary": "The rare kaon decays $K\\toπν\\barν$ are strongly suppressed in the standard model and widely regarded as processes in which new phenomena, not predicted by the standard model, may be observed. Recognizing such new phenomena requires precise standard model prediction for the braching ratio of $K\\toπν\\barν$ with controlled uncertainty for both short-distance and long-distance contributions. In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of lattice QCD calculation of the long-distance contribution to rare kaon decays with the emphasis on $K^+\\toπ^+ν\\barν$. Our methodology covers the calculation of both $W$-$W$ and $Z$-exchange diagrams. We discuss the estimation of the power-law, finite-volume corrections and two methods to consistently combine the long distance contribution determined by the lattice methods outlined here with the short distance parts that can be reliably determined using perturbation theory. It is a subsequent work of our first methodology paper on $K\\toπ\\ell^+\\ell^-$, where the focus was made on the $γ$-exchange diagrams.",

We extract the $ρ$ resonance parameters using a Breit-Wigner fit at two different quark masses, corresponding to $m_π = 226$MeV and $m_π = 315$MeV, and perform an extrapolation to the physical point. The extrapolation is based on a unitarized chiral perturbation theory model that describes well the phase-shifts around the resonance for both quark masses. We find that the extrapolated value, $m_ρ = 720(1)(15)$MeV, is significantly lower that the physical rho mass and we argue that this shift could be due to the absence of the strange quark in our calculation.",

That conjecture is challenged by conflicts between the model results and analyses of the same problem using simulations of lattice-regularized QCD (lQCD) and well-constrained Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) studies. We find the conflict is resolved in favor of the lQCD and DSE predictions when both a physically-motivated regularization is employed to suppress the contribution of high-momentum quark modes in the definition of the effective potential connected with the PNJL models and the four-fermion coupling in those models does not react strongly to changes in the mean-field that is assumed to mock-up Polyakov loop dynamics. With the lQCD and DSE predictions thus confirmed, it seems unlikely that simulations of lQCD with $μ_5>0$ can shed any light on a critical endpoint in the regular QCD phase diagram.",

This ensemble has a large spatial volume $V=(3.7\\mathrm{fm})^3$, pion mass $m_π = 230\\mathrm{MeV}$, and spatial lattice spacing $a_s = 0.11\\mathrm{fm}$. Calculation of the necessary temporal correlation matrices is efficiently performed using the stochastic LapH method, while the large volume enables an improved energy resolution compared to previous work. For this single ensemble we obtain $m_ρ/m_π = 3.350(24)$, $g_{ρππ} = 5.99(26)$, and a clear signal for the $I=2$ $s$-wave. The success of the stochastic LapH method in this proof-of-principle large-volume calculation paves the way for quantitative study of the lattice spacing effects and quark mass dependence of scattering amplitudes using state-of-the-art ensembles.",

We discuss several qualitatively distinct classes of composite candidates, including dark mesons, dark baryons, and dark glueballs. We highlight some of the promising strategies for direct detection, especially through dark moments, using the symmetries and properties of the composite description to identify the operators that dominate the interactions of dark matter with matter, as well as dark matter self-interactions. We briefly discuss the implications of these theories at colliders, especially the (potentially novel) phenomenology of dark mesons in various regimes of the models.

Matrix elements of the vector current in a finite-volume are extracted from three-point correlation functions, and from these we determine the infinite-volume amplitude using a generalization of the Lellouch-Lüscher formalism. We determine the amplitude for a range of discrete values of the $ππ$ energy and virtuality of the photon, and observe the expected dynamical enhancement due to the $ρ$ resonance. Describing the energy dependence of the amplitude, we are able to analytically continue into the complex energy plane and from the residue at the $ρ$ pole extract the $ρ\\to πγ^\\star$ transition form factor. This calculation, at $m_π\\approx 400$ MeV, is the first to determine the form factor of an unstable hadron within a first principles approach to QCD.",

A heavy vector charmonium-like state with a mass of $4.33(2)\\,{\\rm GeV}$ is disentangled from the conventional charmonium states in the quenched approximation. This state has affinity for the hybrid-like operators but couples less to the relevant quark bilinear operator. We also try to extract its leptonic decay constant and give a tentative upper limit that it is less than one tenth of that of $J/ψ$, which corresponds to a leptonic decay width about dozens of eV.

For properly chosen sub-manifolds (\"thimbles\") the sign problem disappears or is drastically alleviated. The parametrization of the thimble by real coordinates require the calculation of a jacobian with a computational cost of order O(V^3), where V is proportional to the spacetime volume. In this note we propose two estimators for this jacobian with a computational cost of order O(V).

It is shown that there are 3 gauge invariant and topologically distinct contributions. The separation of the connected sea partons from those of the disconnected sea can be achieved with a combination of the global fit of the parton distribution function (PDF), the semi-inclusive DIS data on the strange PDF and the lattice calculation of the ratio of the strange to $u/d$ momentum fraction in the disconnected insertion. We shall discuss numerical issues associated with lattice calculation of the hadronic tensor involving a four-point function, such as large hadron momenta and improved maximum entropy method to obtain the spectral density from the hadronic tensor in Euclidean time. We also draw a comparison between the large momentum approach to the parton distribution function (PDF) and the hadronic tensor approach.",

      "title": "Deflation as a Method of Variance Reduction for Estimating the Trace of a Matrix Inverse",
      "summary": "Many fields require computing the trace of the inverse of a large, sparse matrix. The typical method used for such computations is the Hutchinson method which is a Monte Carlo (MC) averaging over matrix quadratures. To improve its convergence, several variance reductions techniques have been proposed. In this paper, we study the effects of deflating the near null singular value space. We make two main contributions.\n  First, we analyze the variance of the Hutchinson method as a function of the deflated singular values and vectors. Although this provides good intuition in general, by assuming additionally that the singular vectors are random unitary matrices, we arrive at concise formulas for the deflated variance that include only the variance and mean of the singular values. We make the remarkable observation that deflation may increase variance for Hermitian matrices but not for non-Hermitian ones. This is a rare, if not unique, property where non-Hermitian matrices outperform Hermitian ones. The theory can be used as a model for predicting the benefits of deflation.\n  Second, we use deflation in the context of a large scale application of \"disconnected diagrams\" in Lattice QCD. On lattices, Hierarchical Probing (HP) has previously provided an order of magnitude of variance reduction over MC by removing \"error\" from neighboring nodes of increasing distance in the lattice. Although deflation used directly on MC yields a limited improvement of 30% in our problem, when combined with HP they reduce variance by a factor of over 60 compared to MC. For this, we pre-computated 1000 smallest singular values of an ill-conditioned matrix of size 25 million. Using PRIMME and a domain-specific Algebraic Multigrid preconditioner, we perform one of the largest eigenvalue computations in Lattice QCD at a fraction of the cost of our trace computation.",

      "summary": "We investigate the origin and behavior of oscillations observed in the hadron correlators constructed from the domain wall fermion (DWF) for different parameters involved in lattice QCD simulations. This oscillatory behavior at early time slices hinders the extraction of excited states in hadron spectroscopy. Furthermore, the deviation from exponential decay may have a significant impact on fermion loop calculations performed on the lattice. We present results for several well-known implementations of the DWF actions. We extend the study of Shamir DWF action to include Boriçi and Möbius DWF actions by analyzing the poles of 4D quark propagator. For each action considered, we find an unphysical mode when analyzing the pole structure of the free DWF propagator for a finite extent of the $5^{\\text{th}}$ dimension $L_s$, and we show that this mode is responsible for the oscillatory behavior observed in hadron correlators. We have performed numerical checks on these results and have found that the presence of oscillatory behavior is sensitive to the DWF parameters $a_5$, $b_5$, $c_5$ and DW height $M$. To minimize oscillations, our results suggest that one should choose $M a_5<1$ for the Shamir and Boriçi DWFs, and $M(b_5-c_5)<1$ for Möbius DWF when $M>1$. For each calculation considered, the Borçi DWF displayed the smallest magnitude of oscillation when compared to the Shamir and Möbius DWF actions using the same input parameters.",

All the calculations were done on a 2+1 flavor ensemble with lattices of size $32^3 \\times 64$ generated using the rational hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm at $a=0.081$~fm and with $M_π=312$ MeV. The statistical precision of the data is improved using the all-mode-averaging method. We compare two methods for reducing excited-state contamination: a variational analysis and a two-state fit to data at multiple values of the source-sink separation $t_{\\rm sep}$. We show that both methods can be tuned to significantly reduce excited-state contamination and discuss their relative advantages and cost-effectiveness. A detailed analysis of the size of source smearing used in the calculation of quark propagators and the range of values of $t_{\\rm sep}$ needed to demonstrate convergence of the isovector charges of the nucleon to the $t_{\\rm sep} \\to \\infty $ estimates is presented.",

This behavior is traced to an $a_0(980)$-like resonance, strongly coupled to both $πη$ and $K\\overline{K}$, which is identified with a pole in the complex energy plane, appearing on only a single unphysical Riemann sheet.

Within the framework of quenched QCD with the tree-level improved Symanzik gauge action we identify the DWF parameters which minimise discretisation effects. We find the corresponding effective 4$d$ overlap operator to be exponentially local, independent of the quark mass. We determine a maximum bare heavy quark mass of $am_h\\approx 0.4$, below which the approximate chiral symmetry and O(a)-improvement of DWF are sustained. This threshold appears to be largely independent of the lattice spacing. Based on these findings, we carried out a detailed scaling study for the heavy-strange meson dispersion relation and decay constant on four ensembles with lattice spacings in the range $2.0-5.7\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$. We observe very mild $a^2$ scaling towards the continuum limit. Our findings establish a sound basis for heavy DWF in dynamical simulations of lattice QCD with relevance to Standard Model phenomenology.",

Unitarized Chiral Perturbation Theory is then used to extrapolate the scattering amplitude to the physical light quark masses. The viability of this procedure is demonstrated by its agreement with the experimentally determined scattering phase shift up to center-of-mass energies of 1.2 GeV. Finally, we analytically continue the amplitude to the complex plane to obtain the $ρ$-pole at $\\left[755(2)(1)\\left({}^{20}_{02}\\right) - \\frac{i}{2} 129(3)(1)\\left({}^7_1\\right)\\right]$ MeV.",

      "summary": "We calculate---for the first time in three-flavor lattice QCD---the hadronic matrix elements of all five local operators that contribute to neutral $B^0$- and $B_s$-meson mixing in and beyond the Standard Model. We present a complete error budget for each matrix element and also provide the full set of correlations among the matrix elements. We also present the corresponding bag parameters and their correlations, as well as specific combinations of the mixing matrix elements that enter the expression for the neutral $B$-meson width difference. We obtain the most precise determination to date of the SU(3)-breaking ratio $ξ= 1.206(18)(6)$, where the second error stems from the omission of charm sea quarks, while the first encompasses all other uncertainties. The threefold reduction in total uncertainty, relative to the 2013 Flavor Lattice Averaging Group results, tightens the constraint from $B$ mixing on the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) unitarity triangle. Our calculation employs gauge-field ensembles generated by the MILC Collaboration with four lattice spacings and pion masses close to the physical value. We use the asqtad-improved staggered action for the light valence quarks, and the Fermilab method for the bottom quark. We use heavy-light meson chiral perturbation theory modified to include lattice-spacing effects to extrapolate the five matrix elements to the physical point. We combine our results with experimental measurements of the neutral $B$-meson oscillation frequencies to determine the CKM matrix elements $|V_{td}| = 8.00(34)(8) \\times 10^{-3}$, $|V_{ts}| = 39.0(1.2)(0.4) \\times 10^{-3}$, and $|V_{td}/V_{ts}| = 0.2052(31)(10)$, which differ from CKM-unitarity expectations by about 2$σ$. These results and others from flavor-changing-neutral currents point towards an emerging tension between weak processes that are mediated at the loop and tree levels.",

      "summary": "The nature of chiral phase transition for two flavor QCD is an interesting but unresolved problem. One of the most intriguing issues is whether or not the anomalous U(1) symmetry in the flavor sector is effectively restored along with the chiral symmetry. This may determine the universality class of the chiral phase transition. Since the physics near the chiral phase transition is essentially non-perturbative, we employ first principles lattice techniques to address this issue. We use overlap fermions, which have exact chiral symmetry on the lattice, to probe the anomalous U(1) symmetry violation of 2+1 flavor dynamical QCD configurations with domain wall fermions. The latter also optimally preserves chiral and flavor symmetries on the lattice, since it is known that the remnant chiral symmetry of the light quarks influences the scaling of the chiral condensate in the crossover transition region. We observe that the anomalous U(1) is not effectively restored in the chiral crossover region. We perform a systematic study of the finite size and cut-off effects since the signals of U(1) violation are sensitive to it. We also provide a glimpse of the microscopic topological structures of the QCD medium that are responsible for the strongly interacting nature of the quark gluon plasma phase. We study the effect of these microscopic constituents through our first calculations for the topological susceptibility of QCD at finite temperature, which could be a crucial input for the equation of state for anomalous hydrodynamics.",

To discern such New Physics one must be able to control the errors on the Standard Model prediction of the decay amplitude. These particular decay channels however are dominated by a single photon exchange; this involves a sizeable long-distance hadronic contribution which represents the current major source of theoretical uncertainty. Here we outline our methodology for the computation of the long distance contributions to these rare decay amplitudes using lattice QCD, and present the numerical results of some exploratory studies using the Domain Wall Fermion ensembles of the RBC and UKQCD collaborations.",

Along the series of study by LatKMI collaboration using HISQ fermions, S-parameter and vector decay constant, which provide important constraints in the model of electroweak symmetry breaking, are calculated for this theory. Use of various volumes allows a systematic investigation of finite volume effects. A strong sensitivity of the S-parameter to the volume is found.",

      "summary": "We recently derived a quantization condition for the energy of three relativistic particles in a cubic box. Here we use this condition to study the energy level closest to the three-particle threshold when the total three-momentum vanishes. We expand this energy in powers of $1/L$, where $L$ is the linear extent of the finite volume. The expansion begins at ${\\cal O}(1/L^3)$, and we determine the coefficients of the terms through ${\\cal O}(1/L^6)$. As is also the case for the two-particle threshold energy, the $1/L^3$, $1/L^4$ and $1/L^5$ coefficients depend only on the two-particle scattering length $a$. These can be compared to previous results obtained using nonrelativistic quantum mechanics and we find complete agreement. The $1/L^6$ coefficients depend additionally on the two-particle effective range $r$ (just as in the two-particle case) and on a suitably defined threshold three-particle scattering amplitude (a new feature for three particles). A second new feature in the three-particle case is that logarithmic dependence on $L$ appears at $\\mathcal O(1/L^6)$. Relativistic effects enter at this order, and the only comparison possible with the nonrelativistic result is for the coefficient of the logarithm, where we again find agreement. For a more thorough check of the $1/L^6$ result, and thus of the quantization condition, we also compare to a perturbative calculation of the threshold energy in relativistic $λφ^4$ theory, which we have recently presented. Here all terms can be compared and we find full agreement.",

      "summary": "We present updated results of a numerical improvement test with heavy-meson spectrum for the Oktay--Kronfeld (OK) action. The OK action is an extension of the Fermilab improvement program for massive Wilson fermions including all dimension-six and some dimension-seven bilinear terms. Improvement terms are truncated by HQET power counting at $\\mathrm{O}(Λ^3/m_Q^3)$ for heavy-light systems, and by NRQCD power counting at $\\mathrm{O}(v^6)$ for quarkonium. They suffice for tree-level matching to QCD to the given order in the power-counting schemes. To assess the improvement, we generate new data with the OK and Fermilab action that covers both charm and bottom quark mass regions on a MILC coarse $(a \\approx 0.12~\\text{fm})$ $2+1$ flavor, asqtad-staggered ensemble. We update the analyses of the inconsistency quantity and the hyperfine splittings for the rest and kinetic masses. With one exception, the results clearly show that the OK action significantly reduces heavy-quark discretization effects in the meson spectrum. The exception is the hyperfine splitting of the heavy-light system near the $B_s$ meson mass, where statistics are too low to draw a firm conclusion, despite promising results.",

Looking at the simulations performed by the LatKMI collaboration of these theories, we use the topological susceptibility as an additional probe of the IR dynamics. By drawing a comparison with SU(3) pure gauge theory, we see a dynamical quenching effect emerge at larger number of flavours, which is suggestive of emerging near-conformal and conformal behaviour.",

Carrying out non-perturbative lattice calculations at the lightest masses and largest volumes considered to date, we confirm the existence of a remarkably light singlet scalar particle. We explore the rich resonance spectrum of the 8-flavor theory in the context of the search for new physics beyond the standard model at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Connecting our results to models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking, we estimate the vector resonance mass to be about 2 TeV with a width of roughly 450 GeV, and predict additional resonances with masses below ~3 TeV.",

      "summary": "The Electroweak interactions of a strongly coupled gauge theory are discussed with outlook beyond the Standard Model (BSM) under global and gauge anomaly constraints. The theory is built on a minimal massless fermion doublet of the SU(2) BSM flavor group (bsm-flavor) with a confining gauge force at the TeV scale in the two-index symmetric (sextet) representation of the BSM SU(3) color gauge group (bsm-color). The intriguing possibility of near-conformal sextet gauge dynamics could lead to the minimal realization of the composite Higgs mechanism with a light $0^{++}$ scalar, far separated from strongly coupled resonances of the confining gauge force in the 2-3 TeV range, distinct from Higgsless Technicolor. In previous publications we have presented results for the meson spectrum of the theory, including the light composite scalar, perhaps the emergent Higgs impostor. Here we discuss the critically important role of the baryon spectrum in the sextet model investigating its compatibility with what we know about thermal evolution of the early Universe including its galactic and terrestrial relics. For an important application, we report the first numerical results on the baryon spectrum of this theory from non-perturbative lattice simulations with baryon correlators in the staggered fermion implementation of the strongly coupled gauge sector. The quantum numbers of composite baryons and their spectroscopy from lattice simulations are required inputs for exploring dark matter contributions of the sextet BSM model, as outlined for future work.",

By comparing these with $N_f=12$ QCD, which has properties consistent with conformality, possible signals of walking dynamics are discussed.

The calculations are done using $N_f=2+1+1$ flavor HISQ ensembles generated by the MILC Collaboration at three values of the lattice spacing ($a=0.12,\\ 0.09,$ and $0.06$ fm) and three values of the quark mass ($M_π\\approx 310,\\ 220$ and $130$ MeV); and clover fermions for calculating the correlation functions, i.e., we use a clover-on-HISQ lattice formulation. The all-mode-averaging method allows us to increase the statistics by a factor of eight for the same computational cost leading to a better understanding of and control over excited state contamination. Our current results, after extrapolation to the continuum limit and physical pion mass are $g_A^{u-d} = 1.21(3)$, $g_T^{u-d} = 1.005(59)$ and $g_S^{u-d} = 0.95(12) $. Further checks of control over all systematic errors, especially in $g_A^{u-d}$, are still being performed. Using results for the flavor-diagonal charges, $g_T^{u} $, $g_T^{d} $ and $g_T^{s}$, we analyze contributions of the quark electric dipole moment to the neutron EDM and the consequences for split SUSY model.",

By adapting features from the traditional finite element methods (FEM) and Regge Calculus, a new simplicial lattice Quantum Finite Element (QFE) Lagrangian is constructed for fields on a smooth Riemann manifold. To reach the continuum limit additional counter terms must be constructed to cancel the ultraviolet distortions. This is tested by the comparison of phi 4-th theory at the Wilson-Fisher fixed point with the exact Ising (c =1/2) CFT on a 2D Riemann sphere. The Dirac equation is also constructed on a simplicial lattice approximation to a Riemann manifold by introducing a lattice vierbein and spin connection on each link. Convergence of the QFE Dirac equation is tested against the exact solution for the 2D Riemann sphere. Future directions and applications to Conformal Field Theories are suggested.",
