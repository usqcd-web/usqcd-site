      "summary": "Updates on results for the electric, magnetic and axial vector form factors are presented. The data analyzed cover high statistics measurements on 11 ensembles generated with 2+1+1 flavors of HISQ fermions by the MILC collaboration. The data cover the range $0.057\\;\\mathrm{fm} < a < 0.15\\;\\mathrm{fm}$ in lattice spacing, $135\\;\\mathrm{MeV} < M_π< 320\\;\\mathrm{MeV}$ in the pion mass and $3.3 < M_πL < 5.5 $ in the lattice size. Fits to control excited-state contamination use up to 3-states in the spectral decomposition of the 3-point functions. The simultaneous chiral-continuum-finite-volume fits include leading order corrections in each of the three variables.",

      "title": "Quantum 3: Learning QCD through Intuitive Play",
      "summary": "There is a nationwide drive to get more girls into physics and coding, and some educators believe gaming could be a way to get girls interested in coding and STEM topics. This project, sponsored by NSF, is to create a QCD game that will raise public interest in QCD, especially among K-12 girls, and increase interest in coding among girls. Through the immersive framework of interactive gameplay, this QCD phone game will allow the public to peek into the QCD research world. The game design will fall into the \"Match 3\" genre, which typically attracts a higher ratio of female players. The game will be implemented initially as a phone app, and the gameplay would require learning simple QCD rules to progress. By leveraging the willingness of players to engage with the rules of an entertaining game, they are able to easily learn a few principles of physics. The game is now available to download from the Google Play store (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gellab.quantum3) and the Apple Appstore (https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/quantum-3/id1406630529)!\n  We formed a development team of MSU undergraduate students to make the game and provided them with a QCD curriculum. The game will be tested at MSU outreach activities, as well as among local K-12 girls through school activities, and feedback will be used to improve the design. The final game can be easily distributed through various app stores and impact will be measured through a follow-up survey. If such a new direction works to attract more girls to coding and physics, one should develop more games to engage more girls in STEM.",

      "summary": "We present the first continuum extrapolation of the hyperon octet axial couplings ($g_{ΣΣ}$ and $g_{ΞΞ}$) from $N_f=2+1+1$ lattice QCD. These couplings are important parameters in the low-energy effective field theory description of the octet baryons and fundamental to the nonleptonic decays of hyperons and to hyperon-hyperon and hyperon-nucleon scattering with application to neutron stars. We use clover lattice fermion action for the valence quarks with sea quarks coming from configurations of $N_f=2+1+1$ highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ) generated by MILC Collaboration. Our work includes the first calculation of $g_{ΣΣ}$ and $g_{ΞΞ}$ directly at the physical pion mass on the lattice, and a full account of systematic uncertainty, including excited-state contamination, finite-volume effects and continuum extrapolation, all addressed for the first time. We find the continuum-limit hyperon coupling constants to be $g_{ΣΣ}=0.4455(55)_\\text{stat}(65)_\\text{sys}$ and $g_{ΞΞ} =-0.2703(47)_\\text{stat}(13)_\\text{sys}$, which correspond to low-energy constants of $D = 0.708(10)_\\text{stat}(6)_\\text{sys}$ and $F = 0.438(7)_\\text{stat}(6)_\\text{sys}$. The corresponding SU(3) symmetry breaking is 9\\% which is about a factor of 2 smaller than the earlier lattice estimate.",

      "summary": "Standard Model determinations of properties of strongly interacting systems of hadrons have become possible with the powerful method of lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD), a method with growing applicability and reliability. While growth in computational power and innovations in algorithmic and computational approaches have been essential in advancing the state of the field, conceptual and formal developments have played a crucial role in turning the output of LQCD computations to phenomenologically valuable results. From the invention of finite-volume technology to access physical observables by Martin Lüscher over three decades ago to date, this field has grown in scope and complexity, enabling studies of scattering amplitudes and reaction rates, as well as spectroscopy of excited states of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and resonances. Further, LQCD studies are augmented with the inclusion of quantum electrodynamics (QED), and subtleties related to the finite volume of systems in presence of QED have been understood and largely controlled. In this talk, I focus on selected developments to give a taste of the status of the field concerning the mapping between the finite and infinite-volume physics and its state-of-the-art applications.",

We focus on decay constants and semileptonic form factors of both light ($π$ and K) and heavy-light ($D_{(s)}$ and $B_{(s)}$) mesons. Implication of $Λ_b$ form factors will be shown. When combined with experimental results for branching fractions and differential decay rates, the above calculations strongly constrain the first two rows of the CKM matrix.

      "summary": "Precision experimental tests of the Standard Model of particle physics (SM) are one of our best hopes for discovering what new physics lies beyond the SM (BSM). Key in the search for new physics is the connection between theory and experiment. Forging this connection for searches involving low-energy hadronic or nuclear environments requires the use of a non-perturbative theoretical tool, lattice QCD. We present two recent lattice QCD calculations by the CalLat collaboration relevant for new physics searches: the nucleon axial coupling, $g_A$, whose precise value as predicted by the SM could help point to new physics contributions to the so-called \"neutron lifetime puzzle\", and hadronic matrix elements of short-ranged operators relevant for neutrinoless double beta decay searches.",

The state-of-art lattice QCD study of this process will soon achieve a precision that QED effects can no longer be neglected. The inclusion of QED in such calculations is planned, and the formalism to relate the finite-volume matrix element obtained from these calculations to the physical amplitude is underway. Here, we report on the progress towards an extension of the Lellouch-Lüscher formalism in presence of QED, with the goal of enabling the extraction of physical amplitudes for the $K\\rightarrow ππ$ process with charged initial and/or final states.",

We also give various details relevant for the implementation of this formalism in a realistic numerical lattice QCD calculation. Particular focus is given to the role of single-particle form factors in disentangling finite-volume effects from the triangle diagram that arise when $\\mathcal J$ couples to one of the two hadrons. This also leads to a new finite-volume function, denoted $G$, the numerical evaluation of which is described in detail. As an example we discuss the determination of the $ππ+ \\mathcal J \\to ππ$ amplitude in the $ρ$ channel, for which the single-pion form factor, $F_π(Q^2)$, as well as the scattering phase, $δ_{ππ}$, are required to remove all power-law finite-volume effects. The formalism presented here holds for local currents with arbitrary Lorentz structure, and we give specific examples of insertions with up to two Lorentz indices.",

Proton decays must be mediated through effective low-energy baryon number violating operators made of three quarks and a lepton. We calculate matrix elements of these operators between the proton and various meson final states using the direct method. We report on preliminary results of matrix element calculation done with the 2+1 dynamical flavor domain wall fermions at the physical point for the first time.",

      "summary": "We present results for the $SU(3)$ breaking ratios of decay constants $f_{D_s}/f_D$ and $f_{B_s}/f_B$ and - for the first time with physical pion masses - the ratio of bag parameters $B_{B_s}/B_{B_d}$, as well as the ratio $ξ$, forming the ratio of the nonpeturbative contributions to neutral $B_{(s)}$ meson mixing. Our results are based on Lattice QCD simulations with chirally symmetric 2+1 dynamical flavors of domain wall fermions. Eight ensembles at three different lattice spacing in the range $a = 0.11 - 0.07\\,\\mathrm{fm}$ enter the analysis two of which feature physical light quark masses. Multiple heavy quark masses are simulated ranging from below the charm quark mass to half the bottom quark mass. The $SU(3)$ breaking ratios display a very benign heavy mass behaviour allowing for extrapolation to the physical bottom quark mass. The results in the continuum limit including all sources of systematic errors are $f_{D_s}/f_D = 1.1740(51)_\\mathrm{stat}(^{+68}_{-68})_\\mathrm{sys}$, $f_{B_s}/f_B = 1.1949(60)_\\mathrm{stat}(^{+\\hphantom{0}95}_{-175})_\\mathrm{sys}$, $B_{B_s}/B_{B_d} = 0.9984(45)_\\mathrm{stat}(^{+80}_{-63})_\\mathrm{sys}$ and $ξ= 1.1939(67)_\\mathrm{stat}(^{+\\hphantom{0}95}_{-177})_\\mathrm{sys}$. Combining these with experimentally measured values we extract the ratios of CKM matrix elements $|V_{cd}/V_{cs}| = 0.2164(57)_\\mathrm{exp}(^{+12}_{-12})_\\mathrm{lat}$ and $|V_{td}/V_{ts}| = 0.20329(41)_\\mathrm{exp}(^{+162}_{-301})_\\mathrm{lat}$.",

The results were obtained using lattice QCD calculations carried out with two degenerate up and down dynamical quarks and a dynamical strange quark, with quark masses corresponding to physical values of pion and kaon masses in the continuum limit. By parameterizing pseudo-critical temperatures as $ T_c(μ_X) = T_c(0) \\left[ 1 -κ_2^{X}(μ_{X}/T_c(0))^2 -κ_4^{X}(μ_{X}/T_c(0))^4 \\right] $, we determined $κ_2^X$ and $κ_4^X$ from Taylor expansions of chiral observables in $μ_X$. We obtained a precise result for $T_c(0)=(156.5\\pm1.5)\\;\\mathrm{MeV}$. For analogous thermal conditions at the chemical freeze-out of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, i.e., $μ_{S}(T,μ_{B})$ and $μ_{Q}(T,μ_{B})$ fixed from strangeness-neutrality and isospin-imbalance, we found $κ_2^B=0.012(4)$ and $κ_4^B=0.000(4)$. For $μ_{B}\\lesssim300\\;\\mathrm{MeV}$, the chemical freeze-out takes place in the vicinity of the QCD phase boundary, which coincides with the lines of constant energy density of $0.42(6)\\;\\mathrm{GeV/fm}^3$ and constant entropy density of $3.7(5)\\;\\mathrm{fm}^{-3}$.",

Recent years have seen fast development of the large-momentum effective theory which allows extraction of the $x$-dependence of parton distribution functions from a quasi-parton distribution function that can be directly calculated on lattice. The extraction is based on a factorization formula for the quasi-parton distribution function that has been derived rigorously in perturbation theory. A systematic procedure that includes renormalization, perturbative matching, and power corrections has been established to calculate parton distribution functions. Latest progress from lattice QCD has shown promising signs that it will become an effective tool for calculating parton physics.",

      "summary": "The increasing imbalance between the computing capabilities of individual nodes and the internode bandwidth makes it highly desirable for any Lattice QCD algorithm to minimize the amount of internode communication. One of the relatively new methods for this is the `Split Grid' or `Split Domain' method, where data is rearranged within the running of a single binary, so that the routines which requires significant off-node communications such as Dirac operators are run on multiple smaller partitions in parallel with a better surface to volume ratio, while other routines are run in one partition.\n  While it is relatively straightforward to utilize Split Grid method for inverters, the typical Lanczos algorithm which has one starting vector does not render itself naturally to Split Grid method. In this report we investigate the Block Lanczos algorithm(BL), which allows multiple starting vectors to be processed in parallel. It is shown that for a moderate number of starting vectors, BL achieves convergence comparable to similarly tuned Implicitly Restarted Lanczos algorithm (IRL) on 2+1-flavor physical DWF/Möbius ensemble.",

      "summary": "We formulate the physics of two species of non-relativistic hard-core bosons with attractive or repulsive delta function interactions on a space-time lattice in the worldline approach. We show that worm algorithms can efficiently sample the worldline configurations in any fixed particle-number sector if the chemical potential is tuned carefully. Since fermions can be treated as hard-core bosons up to a permutation sign, we apply this approach to study non-relativistic fermions. The fermion permutation sign is an observable in this approach and can be used to extract energies in each particle-number sector. In one dimension, non-relativistic fermions can only permute across boundaries, and so our approach does not suffer from sign problems in many cases, unlike the auxiliary field method. Using our approach, we discover limitations of the recently proposed complex Langevin calculations in one spatial dimension for some parameter regimes. In higher dimensions, our method suffers from the usual fermion sign problem. Here we provide evidence that it may be possible to alleviate this problem for few-body physics",

      "summary": "We present results from a calculation of beyond the standard model (BSM) kaon mixing including data physical with light quark masses. We simulate $N_f=2+1$ QCD with Iwasaki gauge and domain wall fermion action on 8 ensembles, spanning 3 lattice spacings and pion masses from the physical value up to 430MeV. The ratio of the BSM to standard model (SM) matrix elements are extracted from the correlation functions and renormalised using the RI-SMOM Rome-Southampton method with non-exceptional kinematics. The results at the physical point continuum limit are found by performing a simultaneous continuum chiral extrapolation. In this work we gain consistency with our previous results and achieve a reduction in both the statistical and systematic error.",

      "summary": "We present high-statistics results for the isovector and flavor diagonal charges of the proton using 11 ensembles of 2+1+1 flavor HISQ fermions. In the isospin symmetric limit, results for the neutron are given by the $u \\leftrightarrow d$ interchange. A chiral-continuum fit with leading order corrections was made to extract the connected and disconnected contributions in the continuum limit and at $M_π=135$ MeV. All results are given in the $\\overline{MS}$ scheme at 2 GeV. The isovector charges, $g_A^{u-d} = 1.218(25)(30)$, $g_S^{u-d} = 1.022(80)(60) $ and $g_T^{u-d} = 0.989(32)(10)$, are used to obtain low-energy constraints on novel scalar and tensor interactions, $ε_{S}$ and $ε_{T}$, at the TeV scale. The flavor diagonal axial charges are: $g_A^u \\equiv Δu \\equiv \\langle 1 \\rangle_{Δu^+} = 0.777(25)(30)$, $g_A^d \\equiv Δd \\equiv \\langle 1 \\rangle_{Δd^+} = -0.438(18)(30)$, and $g_A^s \\equiv Δs \\equiv \\langle 1 \\rangle_{Δs^+} = -0.053(8)$. Their sum gives the total quark contribution to the proton spin, $\\sum_{q=u,d,s} (\\frac{1}{2} Δq) = 0.143(31)(36)$. This result is in good agreement with the recent COMPASS analysis $0.13 < \\frac{1}{2} ΔΣ< 0.18$. Implications of results for the flavor diagonal tensor charges, $g_T^u = 0.784(28)(10)$, $g_T^d = -0.204(11)(10)$ and $g_T^s = -0.0027(16)$ for constraining the quark electric dipole moments and their contributions to the neutron electric dipole moment are discussed. These flavor diagonal charges also give the strength of the interaction of dark matter with nucleons via axial and tensor mediators.",

Specifically, our model is an SU(4) gauge theory coupled to dynamical fermions in the fundamental and two-index antisymmetric (sextet) representations.

      "summary": "The charge radius of the proton has been measured in scattering and spectroscopy experiments using both electronic and muonic probes. The electronic and muonic measurements are discrepant at $5σ$, giving rise to what is known as the proton radius puzzle.\n  With the goal of resolving this, we introduce a novel method of using lattice QCD to determine the isovector charge radius -- defined as the slope of the electric form factor at zero four-momentum transfer -- by introducing a mass splitting between the up and down quarks. This allows us to access timelike four-momentum transfers as well as spacelike ones, leading to potentially higher accuracy in determining the form factor slope at $Q^2 = 0$ by interpolation. In this preliminary study, we find a Dirac isovector radius squared of $0.320 \\pm 0.074$ fm$^2$ at quark masses corresponding to $m_π= 450$ MeV. We compare the feasibility of this method with other approaches of determining the proton charge radius from lattice QCD.",

In addition to reducing discretization errors, this technique enables the resulting position-space correlators to be evaluated at any physical distance, making them continuous functions similar to the $O(4)$-symmetric position-space Green's functions in the continuum theory but with a residual dependence on a regularization parameter, the lattice spacing $a$. We can then take the continuum limit of these renormalized quantities calculated at the same physical renormalization scale $|x|$ and investigate the resulting $|x|$-dependence to identify the appropriate renormalization window.\n  As a numerical test of the spherical averaging technique, we determine the renormalized light and strange quark masses by renormalizing the scalar current. We see a substantial reduction of discretization effects on the scalar current correlator and an enhancement of the renormalization window. The numerical simulation is carried out with $2+1$-flavor domain-wall fermions at three lattice cutoffs in the range 1.79--3.15~GeV.",

Using a combination of forward, stochastic, and sequential propagators, we calculate the two-point and three-point functions that allow us to determine the $πγ\\toππ$ matrix elements for several values of the invariant mass $s$ and momentum transfer $q^2$. To fit the $q^2$ and $s$ dependence of the $πγ\\toππ$ amplitude, we explore a set of general parametrizations based on a Taylor expansion. By analytic continuation to the complex pole corresponding to the $ρ$ resonance, we determine the resonant form factors and calculate the radiative decay width of the $ρ$.",

As a consequence of confinement, the energy between the quark-antiquark pair is contained inside a color flux tube, which will break due to pair creation as soon as the energy is high enough. String breaking is manifested as a quantum-mechanical mixing phenomenon between different states containing two infinitely heavy quarks. We investigate this phenomenon with $N_\\mathrm{f}=2+1$ flavors of dynamical fermions in the stochastic LapH framework, using an ensemble of gauge configurations generated through the CLS effort.

      "summary": "Within the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the rich structure of hadrons can be quantitatively characterized, among others, using a basis of universal non-perturbative functions: parton distribution functions (PDFs), generalized parton distributions (GPDs), transverse-momentum dependent distributions (TMDs) and distribution amplitudes (DAs). For more than half a century, there has been a joint experimental and theoretical effort to obtain these partonic functions. However, the complexity of the strong interactions has placed severe limitations, and first-principle results on the distributions was extracted mostly from their moments computed in Lattice QCD. Recently, breakthrough ideas changed the landscape and several approaches were proposed to access the distributions themselves on the lattice.\n  In this paper, we review in considerable detail approaches directly related to partonic distributions. We highlight a recent idea proposed by X. Ji on extracting quasi-distributions that spawned renewed interest in the whole field and sparked the largest amount of numerical studies of Lattice QCD. We discuss theoretical and practical developments, including challenges that had to be overcome, with some yet to be handled. We also review numerical results, including a discussion based on evolving understanding of the underlying concepts and theoretical and practical progress. Particular attention is given to important aspects that validated the quasi-distribution approach, such as renormalization, matching to light-cone distributions and lattice techniques.\n  In addition to a thorough discussion of quasi-distributions, we consider other approaches: hadronic tensor, auxiliary quark methods, pseudo-PDFs, OPE without OPE and good lattice cross sections. In closing, we provide prospects of the field, with emphasis on the necessary conditions to obtain results with controlled uncertainties.",

      "summary": "We derive the Operator Product Expansion whose vacuum expectation value gives the time-moments of the pseudoscalar heavy-light current-current correlator up to and including terms in $α_s^2$ multiplying $\\langle\\overlineψψ\\rangle/M^3$ and terms in $α_s$ multiplying $\\langle α_s G^2 \\rangle/M^4$, where $M$ is the heavy-quark mass. Using lattice QCD results for heavy-strange correlators obtained for a variety of heavy quark masses on gluon field configurations including $u$, $d$ and $s$ quarks in the sea at three values of the lattice spacing, we are able to show that the contribution of the strange-quark condensate to the time-moments is very substantial. We use our lattice QCD time-moments and the OPE to determine a value for the condensate, fitting the 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th time-moments simultaneously. Our result, $\\langle \\overline{s}s \\rangle^{\\overline{\\text{MS}}}(2 \\text{GeV}) = -(296(11) \\,\\mathrm{MeV})^3$, agrees well with HPQCD's earlier, more direct, lattice QCD determination~\\cite{McNeile:2012xh}. As well as confirming that the $s$ quark condensate is close in value to the light quark condensate, this demonstrates clearly the consistency of the Operator Product Expansion for fully nonperturbative calculations of matrix elements of short-distance operators in lattice QCD.",

      "summary": "In the near-future noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era of quantum computing technology, applications of quantum computing will be limited to calculations of very modest scales in terms of the number of qubits used. The need to represent numeric quantities using limited resources leads to digitization errors which must be taken into account. As a first step towards quantum simulations of realistic high-energy physics problems, we explore classically the effects of digitizing elements of the $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge group to a finite set. We consider several methods for digitizing the group, finding the best performance from an action-preserving projection onto a mesh. Working in (3+1) dimensions, we find that using $\\sim 7$ (qu)bits to represent each $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge link induces a digitization error on the order of $10\\%$ in short-distance observables and $2\\%$ in long-distance observables. Promisingly, our results indicate that each $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge link can be represented by $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ (qu)bits, from which we estimate that a $16^3$ $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice could be simulated with no more than $\\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ (qu)bits. Our results on digitization are also of interest as a form of lossy compression that could be used in high-performance classical computing to alleviate communications bottlenecks.",

      "summary": "Short autocorrelation times are essential for a reliable error assessment in Monte Carlo simulations of lattice systems. In many interesting scenarios, the decay of autocorrelations in the Markov chain is prohibitively slow. Generative samplers can provide statistically independent field configurations, thereby potentially ameliorating these issues. In this work, the applicability of neural samplers to this problem is investigated. Specifically, we work with a generative adversarial network (GAN). We propose to address difficulties regarding its statistical exactness through the implementation of an overrelaxation step, by searching the latent space of the trained generator network. This procedure can be incorporated into a standard Monte Carlo algorithm, which then permits a sensible assessment of ergodicity and balance based on consistency checks. Numerical results for real, scalar $φ^4$-theory in two dimensions are presented. We achieve a significant reduction of autocorrelations while accurately reproducing the correct statistics. We discuss possible improvements to the approach as well as potential solutions to persisting issues.",

Phase unwrapping techniques from signal processing are applied to lattice field theory in order to map compact random phases to noncompact random variables that can be numerically sampled without sign or signal-to-noise problems. A cumulant expansion can be used to reconstruct average correlation functions from moments of unwrapped phases, but points where the field magnitude fluctuates close to zero lead to ambiguities in the definition of the unwrapped phase and significant noise at higher orders in the cumulant expansion. Phase unwrapping algorithms that average fluctuations over physical length scales improve, but do not completely resolve, these issues in one dimension. Similar issues are seen in other applications of phase unwrapping, where they are found to be more tractable in higher dimensions.",

Furthermore, we show that the chiral condensate is sensitive to the RW transition and may serve as a energy-like operator characterizing universal behavior close to the RW endpoint.",

      "summary": "We present results for the flavor non-singlet u-d parton distribution functions within the nucleon using the quasi-PDF approach. The lattice calculation is performed by employing the twisted mass formulation and two gauge ensembles, having $N_f = 2$ and $N_f = 2 + 1 + 1$ dynamical fermions with masses tuned to their physical value. For the $N_f = 2$ physical point ensemble, the unpolarized, helicity and transversity distributions are computed for three values of the nucleon momentum, namely [6, 8, 10]$π/L$ corresponding to [0.83,1.11,1.38] GeV. Upon renormalization, we find that, as the nucleon momentum increases, the lattice results approach the phenomenological distributions resulting from analyses of deep inelastic scattering data, opening a promising path for a direct evaluation of parton distributions from the QCD Lagrangian. For the $N_f = 2 + 1 + 1$ physical point ensemble, we present preliminary results for the unpolarized distribution extracted from a nucleon boosted by $8π/L$ or 0.97 GeV.",

Ji, it has become feasible to extract parton distribution functions (PDFs) from lattice QCD, a task thought to be extremely difficult before Ji's proposal. In this talk, we discuss this approach, in particular different systematic effects that need to be controlled to ultimately have precise determinations of PDFs. Special attention is paid to the analysis of excited states. We emphasize that it is crucial to control excited states contamination and we show an analysis thereof for our lattice data, used to calculate quasi-PDFs and finally light-cone PDFs in the second part of this proceeding (C.

      "summary": "The traditional approach for studying the physics of the strong interactions employs a basic computational construct originally proposed by Wilson in the 1970s. Over the years additional enhancements have been added to this formulation to improve computational performance and accuracy. This formulation has been successfully implemented on high performance computing systems and has yielded accurate calculations for many static properties of the strong interactions (such as the hadron mass spectrum). With the recent advances in quantum computing, the question that is now being asked is whether an equivalent type of gauge invariant formulation of a field theory can be constructed on a quantum computer to calculate dynamical processes that cannot be simulated on a traditional supercomputer. Using the Quantum Link Model (QLM) plus the concept of rishons, this paper will specifically focus on the challenges implementing a basic gauge link lattice construct using SU(2) non-Abelian links for illustration. The paper will also discuss the physics that may potentially be simulated on a quantum computer with this construct and speculate on the prospects for having quantum computers become a part of the set of hardware platforms for lattice gauge theory simulations in the future.",

We study the entropy, which is smooth across all temperatures, supportive of an infinite order transition. This system has a well-known duality with the massive Thirring model, which can play the role of a toy models for Montonen-Olive duality in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory, since it relates solitons to elementary field excitations.

This function is computed by lattice Monte Carlo in SU(2) pure gauge theory at lattice couplings $β=2.2$ and $β=2.5$ in both Coulomb and Landau gauges. The Coulomb gauge correlator is well behaved, and is dominated at large T by a state whose energy grows linearly as $σR$, with $σ$ the known asymptotic string tension. The connected correlator in Landau gauge behaves differently. At intermediate R there is clear evidence of a linear potential, but the corresponding string tension extrapolates to zero at large T. At large R the connected correlator becomes negative; moreover there are strong finite size effects. These numerical results suggest that unphysical states dominate the large Euclidean time behavior of this Landau gauge correlator.",

The key observation in the latter work is that fermions acquire masses at strong coupling via the formation of a symmetric four fermion condensate in contrast to the more usual symmetry breaking bilinear condensate seen in eg. NJL models. The current work attempts to see whether this structure survives when the four fermi interactions are replaced by gauge interactions and to explore the resulting phase diagram.",

This makes use of a recently proposed finite-volume formalism to determine a class of observables that are experimentally inaccessible but can be accessed via lattice QCD. In particular, we shown that finite-volume two-body matrix elements with one current insertion can be directly related to scattering amplitudes coupling to the external current. For two-hadron systems with resonances or bound states, one can extract the corresponding form factors of these from the energy-dependence of the amplitudes.",

      "summary": "At small transverse momentum $q_T$, transverse-momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) arise as genuinely nonperturbative objects that describe Drell-Yan like processes in hadron collisions as well as semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering. TMDPDFs naturally depend on the hadron momentum, and the associated evolution is determined by the Collins-Soper equation. For $q_T \\sim Λ_\\mathrm{QCD}$ the corresponding evolution kernel (or anomalous dimension) is nonperturbative and must be determined as an independent ingredient in order to relate TMDPDFs at different scales. We propose a method to extract this kernel using lattice QCD and the Large-Momentum Effective Theory, where the physical TMD correlation involving light-like paths is approximated by a quasi TMDPDF, defined using equal-time correlation functions with a large-momentum hadron state. The kernel is determined from a ratio of quasi TMDPDFs extracted at different hadron momenta.",

The numerical investigation is carried out in the quenched approximation with the physical volume $L\\approx 2.4$ fm at two values of lattice spacing (0.05 and 0.075 fm). We obtain clean signals for the relevant Euclidean hadronic tensor with reasonable statistics, but observe that the lattice artefacts are non-negligible in our results. The key conclusion from the analysis hitherto is that although our approach has the potential for making significant contributions to parton physics, data at finer lattice spacings that are currently being produced are needed in order to control the continuum extrapolation.",

      "summary": "We simulate lattice QCD at finite quark-number chemical potential, $μ$, using the complex-Langevin equation (CLE) with gauge-cooling and adaptive updating to prevent instabilities. The CLE is used because QCD at finite $μ$ has a complex fermion determinant which precludes the use of standard simulation methods based on importance sampling. Since, even when CLE simulations converge, they are not guaranteed to produce correct results except under very stringent conditions, which lattice QCD at finite $μ$ does not obey, we need extensive testing to determine under what conditions it produces reliable results. We performed simulations at $β=6/g^2=5.6$ and $β=5.7$, both at $m=0.025$. For small $μ$ and $μ$ large enough to produce saturation, measured observables appear to be approaching their correct values as the coupling is decreased. However, for intermediate $μ$ values, these simulations predict a transition from hadronic to nuclear matter at a $μ$ which is far too small. Since there is evidence that for CLE simulations to produce correct results the trajectories should remain close to the $SU(3)$ manifold (at least for small $μ$), we explore the parameter space to see where this is true. We find that the distance from this manifold decreases as the coupling decreases and as the quark mass (in lattice units) decreases, i.e. as we approach the continuum limit. This indicates that we need to simulate at smaller couplings and quark masses (requiring larger lattices) to see if these can produce the correct physics.",

      "summary": "A field theory involving two interacting scalar fields, previously studied by Rummukainen and Gottlieb, is revisited. Our study is not restricted to the limit of large quartic couplings, and a Symanzik-improved action is used so that continuum dispersion relations work well. The Metropolis method, combined with a local microcanonical updating algorithm, is employed in our Monte Carlo calculations. Isotropic lattices ranging from $16^3 \\times 48$ to $53^3 \\times 48$ are used, and scattering phase shifts are determined using a Lüscher analysis with multiple partial waves.",

      "summary": "The $x$-dependence of light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) can be directly calculated from a quasi distribution amplitude (DA) in lattice QCD within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). In this paper, we study the one-loop renormalization of the quasi-DA in the regularization-independent momentum subtraction (RI/MOM) scheme. The renormalization factor for the quasi parton distribution function can be used to renormalize the quasi-DA provided that they are implemented on lattice and in perturbation theory in the same manner. We derive the one-loop matching coefficient that matches quasi-DA in the RI/MOM scheme onto LCDA in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme. Our result provides the crucial step to extract the LCDAs from lattice matrix elements of quasi-DAs.",

      "summary": "We study Kähler-Dirac fermions on Euclidean dynamical triangulations. This fermion formulation furnishes a natural extension of staggered fermions to random geometries without requring vielbeins and spin connections. We work in the quenched approximation where the geometry is allowed to fluctuate but there is no back-reaction from the matter on the geometry. By examining the eigenvalue spectrum and the masses of scalar mesons we find evidence for a four fold degeneracy in the fermion spectrum in the large volume, continuum limit. It is natural to associate this degeneracy with the well known equivalence in continuum flat space between the Kähler-Dirac fermion and four copies of a Dirac fermion. Lattice effects then lift this degeneracy in a manner similar to staggered fermions on regular lattices. The evidence that these discretization effects vanish in the continuum limit suggests both that lattice continuum Kähler-Dirac fermions are recovered at that point, and that this limit truly corresponds to smooth continuum geometries. One additional advantage of the Kähler-Dirac action is that it respects an exact $U(1)$ symmetry on any random triangulation. This $U(1)$ symmetry is related to continuum chiral symmetry. By examining fermion bilinear condensates we find strong evidence that this $U(1)$ symmetry is not spontaneously broken in the model at order the Planck scale. This is a necessary requirement if models based on dynamical triangulations are to provide a valid ultraviolet complete formulation of quantum gravity.",

By applying the gradient flow technique, we can parameterize the renormalization and operator mixing issues associated with the qCEDM operator on the lattice. As the nucleon mixing angle $α_N$ is a key component for determining the neutron and proton electric dipole moments induced by the qCEDM operator, we present the formalism and preliminary results for $α_N$ with respect to the gradient flow time $t_f$. The results are computed on $N_f=2+1$ Wilson-clover lattices provided by PACS-CS. The 3 ensembles have lattice spacing values of $a=\\lbrace 0.1095,\\,0.0936,\\,0.0684\\rbrace $fm, whilst keeping a similar $m_π\\approx701$MeV, and a fixed box size of $L\\approx1.9$fm.",

We find that the better sampling of the lattice enabled through the use of distillation yields a substantial reduction in the statistical uncertainty in comparison with the use of alternative smearing methods, and furthermore, appears to offer better control over the contribution of excited-states compared to use of a single, local interpolating operator. The additional benefit arising through the use of the variational method in the distillation approach is less dramatic, but nevertheless significant given that it requires no additional Dirac inversions.",

For the valence charm quark, the calculation uses Wilson-clover quarks in the Fermilab interpretation. The gauge-field ensembles are generated in the presence of up, down, and strange sea quarks, based on the improved staggered (asqtad) action, and gluon fields, based on the one-loop, tadpole-improved gauge action. We use five lattice spacings and two values of the light sea quark mass to extrapolate the results to the physical point. An enlarged set of interpolating operators is used for a variational analysis to improve the determination of the energies of the ground states in each channel. We present and implement a continuum extrapolation within the Fermilab interpretation, based on power-counting arguments, and thoroughly discuss all sources of systematic uncertainty. We compare our results for various mass splittings with their experimental values, namely, the 1S hyperfine splitting, the 1P-1S splitting and the P-wave spin-orbit and tensor splittings. Given the uncertainty related to the width of the resonances, we find excellent agreement.",

      "summary": "We explore the phase structure of a four dimensional $SO(4)$ invariant lattice Higgs-Yukawa model comprising four reduced staggered fermions interacting with a real scalar field. The fermions belong to the fundamental representation of the symmetry group while the three scalar field components transform in the self-dual representation of $SO(4)$. The model is a generalization of a four fermion system with the same symmetries that has received recent attention because of its unusual phase structure comprising massless and massive symmetric phases separated by a very narrow phase in which a small bilinear condensate breaking $SO(4)$ symmetry is present. The generalization described in this paper simply consists of the addition of a scalar kinetic term. We find a region of the enlarged phase diagram which shows no sign of a fermion condensate or symmetry breaking but in which there is nevertheless evidence of a diverging correlation length. Our results in this region are consistent with the presence of a single continuous phase transition separating the massless and massive symmetric phases observed in the earlier work.",

      "title": "Theoretical aspects of quantum electrodynamics in a finite volume with periodic boundary conditions",
      "summary": "First-principles studies of strongly-interacting hadronic systems using lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) have been complemented in recent years with the inclusion of quantum electrodynamics (QED). The aim is to confront experimental results with more precise theoretical determinations, e.g. for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the CP-violating parameters in the decay of mesons. Quantifying the effects arising from enclosing QED in a finite volume remains a primary target of investigations. To this end, finite-volume corrections to hadron masses in the presence of QED have been carefully studied in recent years. This paper extends such studies to the self-energy of moving charged hadrons, both on and away from their mass shell. In particular, we present analytical results for leading finite-volume corrections to the self-energy of spin-0 and spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles in the presence of QED on a periodic hypercubic lattice, once the spatial zero mode of the photon is removed, a framework that is called $\\mathrm{QED}_{\\mathrm{L}}$. By altering modes beyond the zero mode, an improvement scheme is introduced to eliminate the leading finite-volume corrections to masses, with potential applications to other hadronic quantities. Our analytical results are verified by a dedicated numerical study of a lattice scalar field theory coupled to $\\mathrm{QED}_{\\mathrm{L}}$. Further, this paper offers new perspectives on the subtleties involved in applying low-energy effective field theories in the presence of $\\mathrm{QED}_{\\mathrm{L}}$, a theory that is rendered non-local with the exclusion of the spatial zero mode of the photon, clarifying recent discussions on this matter.",

Using Zeuthen, Symanzik, and Wilson flow we measure the energy density with three different operators. Our updated analysis is based on up to five volume pairs ranging from L^4=8^4 up to 32^4. Predictions for the infinite volume extrapolated step scaling function based on different flows and operators are mutually consistent. Our new results confirm the previously observed significant discrepancy with staggered fermion simulations in a wide range of the renormalized coupling.",

Within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET), we compute the transversity quasi-distributions using clover valence fermions on 2+1+1-flavor (up/down, strange, charm) HISQ-lattice configurations with boosted proton momenta as large as 3.0~GeV. The relevant lattice matrix elements are nonperturbatively renormalized in regularization-independent momentum-subtraction (RI/MOM) scheme and systematically matched to the physical transversity distribution. With high statistics, large proton momenta and meticulous control of excited-state contamination, we provide the best theoretical prediction for the large-$x$ isovector quark transversity distribution, with better precision than the most recent global analyses of experimental data. Our result also shows that the sea quark asymmetry in the proton transversity distribution is consistent with zero, which has been assumed in all current global analyses.",

Here, the first calculation of these form factors from lattice Quantum Chromodynamics is presented. The calculations use a larger-than-physical value of the light quark mass corresponding to $m_π\\sim 450$ MeV. All three form factors, which encode the momentum-dependence of the lowest moment of the spin independent gluon generalised parton distributions and are related to different components of the energy-momentum tensor, are resolved. In particular, the gluon $D$-term form factor, related to the pressure distribution inside the nucleon, is determined for the first time. The gluon contributions to the two gravitational form factors of the pion are also determined, and are compared to existing lattice determinations of the quark contributions to the gravitational form factors and to phenomenology.",

Complementing these calculations and utilizing a 68-dimensional Hilbert space, our photonic simulator is used to perform sub-nucleon calculations of the two-body and three-body forces between heavy mesons in the Schwinger model.

      "summary": "Electric dipole moments (EDMs), which are sought as evidence of CP violation, require lattice calculations to connect constraints from experiments to limits on the strong CP violation within QCD or CP violation in new physics beyond the standard model. Nucleon EDM calculations on a lattice are notoriously hard due to large statistical noise, chiral symmetry violating effects, and potential mixing of the EDM and the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon. In this report, details of ongoing lattice calculations of proton and neutron EDMs induced by the QCD $θ$-term and the quark chromo-EDM, the lowest-dimension effective CP-violating quark-gluon interaction are presented. Our calculation employs chiral-symmetric fermion discretization. An assessment of feasibility of nucleon EDM calculations at the physical point is discussed.",

Ensembles with $N_τ=12$ from the HotQCD and TUMQCD collaboration offer unprecedented high statistics, those with $N_τ=16$ unprecedented time resolution, making possible a robust extraction of the real part from the spectral functions of Wilson line correlators. To this end we deploy a combination of a Bayesian reconstruction (BR method), as well as a Padé-like approximation. We corroborate findings made on less realistic lattices that ${\\rm Re}[V]$ smoothly transitions from a confining to a screened behavior at high temperatures and its values lie close to the color singlet free energies. A finite value of the ${\\rm Im}[V]$ is observed in the quark-gluon-plasma phase.",

We consider two processes involving the $ρ$. The first process is elastic scattering of two pions in P-wave with isospin $1$. Using the Lüscher method we determine the scattering phase shift, from which we obtain the $ρ$ resonance mass and decay width $Γ(ρ\\toππ)$. The second process is the radiative transition $πγ\\toππ$, where we follow the Briceño-Hansen-Walker-Loud approach to determine the transition amplitude in the invariant mass region near the $ρ$ resonance and for both space- and time-like photon momentum. This allows us to determine the coupling between the $ρ$, the pion and the photon, and the resulting $ρ$ radiative decay width.",

      "summary": "Beyond Standard Model theories describing the electro-weak sector must exhibit a large separation of scales (or \"walking\") to account for a light, 125 GeV Higgs boson and the fact that so far no other resonances have been observed. Large separation of scales arises naturally and in a tunable manner in mass-split models that are built on a conformal fixed point in the ultraviolet. Splitting the fermion masses into \"light\" (massless) and \"heavy\" flavors, the system shows conformal behavior in the ultraviolet but is chirally broken in the infrared.\n  Due to the presence of a conformal fixed point, such chirally broken systems show hyperscaling and have a highly constrained resonance spectrum that is significantly different from the QCD spectrum. We highlight most characteristic features presenting numerical data obtained from dynamical simulations of an SU(3) gauge theory with four light and eight heavy flavors. In addition, we give an outlook on ongoing work simulating an SU(3) gauge theory with four light and six heavy flavors using a set-up well suited to explore e.g. mass-generation of Standard Model fermions via four-fermion interactions or partial compositeness.",

Quantities that cannot be fully resolved through experiment, such as the neutron lifetime (whose precise value is important for the existence of light-atomic elements that make the sun shine and life possible), may be understood through numerical solutions to QCD. We directly solve QCD using Lattice Gauge Theory and calculate nuclear observables such as neutron lifetime. We have developed an improved algorithm that exponentially decreases the time-to solution and applied it on the new CORAL supercomputers, Sierra and Summit. We use run-time autotuning to distribute GPU resources, achieving 20% performance at low node count. We also developed optimal application mapping through a job manager, which allows CPU and GPU jobs to be interleaved, yielding 15% of peak performance when deployed across large fractions of CORAL.",

Here we lift this restriction, by deriving the quantization condition for identical scalar particles with a G-parity symmetry, in the case that the two-particle K matrix has a pole in the kinematic regime of interest. As in earlier work, our result involves intermediate infinite-volume quantities with no direct physical interpretation, and we show how these are related to the physical three-to-three scattering amplitude by integral equations. This work opens the door to study processes such as $a_2 \\to ρπ\\to πππ$, in which the $ρ$ is rigorously treated as a resonance state.",

Under the mechanism of light-neutrino exchange, the decay amplitude involves significant long-distance contributions.

At unphysical and physical pion masses, we obtain that amplitudes are $24\\%$ and $9\\%$ smaller than the predication from leading order chiral perturbation theory.

Through variational analysis of matrices of correlation functions computed with large bases of interpolating fields it has proven possible to extract many excited state energy levels, and these can be used to constrain the hadron-hadron scattering amplitudes in which hadron resonances can be observed.

      "summary": "Indeterminacy associated with probing of a quantum state is commonly expressed through spectral distances (metric) featured in the outcomes of repeated experiments. Here we express it as an effective amount (measure) of distinct outcomes instead. The resulting $μ$-uncertainties are described by the effective number theory [1] whose central result, the existence of a minimal amount, leads to a well-defined notion of intrinsic irremovable uncertainty. We derive $μ$-uncertainty formulas for arbitrary set of commuting operators, including the cases with continuous spectra. The associated entropy-like characteristics, the $μ$-entropies, convey how many degrees of freedom are effectively involved in a given measurement process. In order to construct quantum $μ$-entropies, we are led to quantum effective numbers designed to count independent, mutually orthogonal states effectively comprising a density matrix. This concept is basis-independent and leads to a measure-based characterization of entanglement.",

      "summary": "We demonstrate that a nonzero strangeness contribution to the spacelike electromagnetic form factor of the nucleon is evidence for a strange-antistrange asymmetry in the nucleon's light-front wave function, thus implying different nonperturbative contributions to the strange and antistrange quark distribution functions. A recent lattice QCD calculation of the nucleon strange quark form factor predicts that the strange quark distribution is more centralized in coordinate space than the antistrange quark distribution, and thus the strange quark distribution is more spread out in light-front momentum space. We show that the lattice prediction implies that the difference between the strange and antistrange parton distribution functions, $s(x)-\\bar{s}(x)$, is negative at small-$x$ and positive at large-$x$. We also evaluate the strange quark form factor and $s(x)-\\bar{s}(x)$ using a baryon-meson fluctuation model and a novel nonperturbative model based on light-front holographic QCD. This procedure leads to a Veneziano-like expression of the form factor, which depends exclusively on the twist of the hadron and the properties of the Regge trajectory of the vector meson which couples to the quark current in the hadron. The holographic structure of the model allows us to introduce unambiguously quark masses in the form factors and quark distributions preserving the hard scattering counting rule at large-$Q^2$ and the inclusive counting rule at large-$x$. Quark masses modify the Regge intercept which governs the small-$x$ behavior of quark distributions, therefore modifying their small-$x$ singular behavior. Both nonperturbative approaches provide descriptions of the strange-antistrange asymmetry and intrinsic strangeness in the nucleon consistent with the lattice QCD result.",

We then perform a phenomenological analysis, where we combine the strange quark electromagnetic form factor from lattice QCD with (anti)neutrino-nucleon scattering differential cross section from MiniBooNE experiments in a momentum transfer region $0.24\\lesssim Q^2 \\lesssim 0.71$ GeV$^2$ to determine the neutral current weak axial form factor $G^Z_A(Q^2)$ in the range of $0\\lesssim Q^2\\leq 1$ GeV$^2$. This yields a phenomenological value of $G^Z_A(0)=-0.687(89)_{\\rm stat}(40)_{\\rm sys}$. The value of $G^Z_A(0)$ constrained by the lattice QCD calculation of $G^s_A(0)$, when compared to its phenomenological determination, provides a significant improvement in precision and accuracy and can be used to provide a constraint on the fit to $G^Z_A(Q^2)$ for $Q^2>0$. This constrained fit leads to an unambiguous determination of (anti)neutrino-nucleon neutral current elastic scattering differential cross section near $Q^2=0$ and can play an important role in numerically isolating nuclear effects in this region. We show a consistent description of $G^Z_A(Q^2)$ obtained from the (anti)neutrino-nucleon scattering cross section data requires a nonzero contribution of the strange quark electromagnetic form factor. We demonstrate the robustness of our analysis by providing a post-diction of the BNL E734 experimental data.",

      "summary": "Using HISQ $N_f=2+1+1$ MILC ensembles with five different values of the lattice spacing, including four ensembles with physical quark masses, we have performed the most precise computation to date of the $K\\toπ\\ellν$ vector form factor at zero momentum transfer, $f_+^{K^0π^-}(0)=0.9696(15)_\\text{stat}(12)_\\text{syst}$. This is the first calculation that includes the dominant finite-volume effects, as calculated in chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order. Our result for the form factor provides a direct determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{us}|=0.22333(44)_{f_+(0)}(42)_\\text{exp}$, with a theory error that is, for the first time, at the same level as the experimental error. The uncertainty of the semileptonic determination is now similar to that from leptonic decays and the ratio $f_{K^+}/f_{π^+}$, which uses $|V_{ud}|$ as input. Our value of $|V_{us}|$ is in tension at the 2--$2.6σ$ level both with the determinations from leptonic decays and with the unitarity of the CKM matrix. In the test of CKM unitarity in the first row, the current limiting factor is the error in $|V_{ud}|$, although a recent determination of the nucleus-independent radiative corrections to superallowed nuclear $β$ decays could reduce the $|V_{ud}|^2$ uncertainty nearly to that of $|V_{us}|^2$. Alternative unitarity tests using only kaon decays, for which improvements in the theory and experimental inputs are likely in the next few years, reveal similar tensions. As part of our analysis, we calculated the correction to $f_+^{Kπ}(0)$ due to nonequilibrated topological charge at leading order in chiral perturbation theory, for both the full-QCD and the partially-quenched cases. We also obtain the combination of low-energy constants in the chiral effective Lagrangian $[C_{12}^r+C_{34}^r-(L_5^r)^2](M_ρ)=(2.92\\pm0.31)\\cdot10^{-6}$.",

The work is motivated by recent lattice studies of gauge theories near the conformal window, which have shown that the lightest flavor-singlet scalar state in the spectrum ($σ$) can be much lighter than the vector state ($ρ$) and nearly degenerate with the PNGBs ($π$) over a large range of quark masses. The EFT incorporates this feature. We highlight the crucial role played by the terms in the potential that explicitly break chiral symmetry. The explicit breaking can be large enough so that a limited set of additional terms in the potential can no longer be neglected, with the EFT still weakly coupled in this new range. The additional terms contribute importantly to the scalar and pion masses. In particular, they relax the inequality $M_σ^2 \\ge 3 M_π^2$, allowing for consistency with current lattice data.",

      "summary": "Fundamental symmetry tests of baryon number violation in low-energy experiments can probe beyond the Standard Model (BSM) explanations of the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. Neutron-antineutron oscillations are predicted to be a signature of many baryogenesis mechanisms involving low-scale baryon number violation. This work presents first-principles calculations of neutron-antineutron matrix elements needed to accurately connect measurements of the neutron-antineutron oscillation rate to constraints on $|ΔB|=2$ baryon number violation in BSM theories. Several important systematic uncertainties are controlled by using a state-of-the-art lattice gauge field ensemble with physical quark masses and approximate chiral symmetry, performing nonperturbative renormalization with perturbative matching to the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme, and studying excited state effects in two-state fits. Phenomenological implications are highlighted by comparing expected bounds from proposed neutron-antineutron oscillation experiments to predictions of a specific model of post-sphaleron baryogenesis. Quantum chromodynamics is found to predict at least an order of magnitude more events in neutron-antineutron oscillation experiments than previous estimates based on the \"MIT bag model\" for fixed BSM parameters. Lattice artifacts and other systematic uncertainties that are not controlled in this pioneering calculation are not expected to significantly change this conclusion.",

To date, studies of the thermodynamics of QCD at large $N_c$ have been limited to the quenched approximation, i.e., to the behavior of pure $\\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ gauge theory at large $N_c$. This is the first study of thermodynamics at large $N_c$ using dynamical fermions, and thus the first study able to test whether the quenched approximation is a valid way to investigate large $N_c$ thermodynamics. After reviewing 't Hooft's large $N_c$ limit, we discuss the automation we use to make this study feasible, and finally compare our preliminary physics results for $\\mathrm{SU}(3-5)$ with large $N_c$ expectations.",

To realize this goal, one has to find renormalized gluon quasi-PDFs in which power divergences and operator mixing are thoroughly understood. For the unpolarized distribution, we identify four independent quasi-PDF correlators that can be multiplicatively renormalized on the lattice. Similarly, the helicity distribution can be derived from three independent multiplicatively renormalizable quasi-PDFs. We provide a LaMET factorization formula for these renormalized quasi-PDFs from which one can extract the gluon PDFs.",

      "summary": "Qubit, operator and gate resources required for the digitization of lattice $λφ^4$ scalar field theories onto quantum computers are considered, building upon the foundational work by Jordan, Lee and Preskill, with a focus towards noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, introduced in this context by Macridin, Spentzouris, Amundson and Harnik building on the work of Somma, provides a guide with which to evaluate the efficacy of two field-space bases, the eigenstates of the field operator, as used by Jordan, Lee and Preskill, and eigenstates of a harmonic oscillator, to describe $0+1$- and $d+1$-dimensional scalar field theory. We show how techniques associated with improved actions, which are heavily utilized in Lattice QCD calculations to systematically reduce lattice-spacing artifacts, can be used to reduce the impact of the field digitization in $λφ^4$, but are found to be inferior to a complete digitization-improvement of the Hamiltonian using a Quantum Fourier Transform. When the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem is satisfied, digitization errors scale as $|\\log|\\log |ε_{\\rm dig}|||\\sim n_Q$ (number of qubits describing the field at a given spatial site) for the low-lying states, leaving the familiar power-law lattice-spacing and finite-volume effects that scale as $|\\log |ε_{\\rm latt}||\\sim N_Q$ (total number of qubits in the simulation). For localized(delocalized) field-space wavefunctions, it is found that $n_Q\\sim4(7)$ qubits per spatial lattice site are sufficient to reduce theoretical digitization errors below error contributions associated with approximation of the time-evolution operator and noisy implementation on near-term quantum devices.",

This tension is highly correlated with the present discrepancy between the exclusive and inclusive values of $|V_{cb}|$. In order to resolve, in part, the issue with $|V_{cb}|$, it would be highly desirable to have a comprehensive re-analysis over the entire set of experimental data on the $\\bar{B} \\to D^* \\ell \\barν$ decays using an alternative parametrization of the form factors, such as the BGL parametrization, and a comparison with results of the CLN method.",

      "summary": "We present the final results of our high statistics study on the properties of bottomonium and charmonium at finite temperature. We focus on the temperature range around the crossover transition $150\\leq T\\leq 410$MeV, relevant for current heavy ion collision experiments. The QCD medium degrees of freedom which consist of dynamical u,d, and s quarks and gluons are captured by realistic state-of-the art ($m_π\\approx 161$MeV) lattice QCD simulations of the HotQCD collaboration. For the heavy quarks we deploy the non-relativistic effective field theory of QCD, NRQCD. The in-medium properties of quarkonium are deduced from their spectral functions, which are reconstructed using improved and novel Bayesian approaches. Through a systematic analysis we shed light on the origin of the discrepancies in melting temperatures previously reported in the literature, showing that they are owed to underestimated methods uncertainties of the deployed spectral reconstructions. Our simulations corroborate a picture of sequential in-medium modification, ordered according to the vacuum binding energy of the states. As a central quantitative result, our study reveals how the mass of the heavy quarkonium ground state reduces as temperature increases. The observed spectral modifications are interpreted in the light of, and compared to previous studies based on the complex lattice potential for heavy quarkonium. Thus for the first time we provide a robust picture of in-medium heavy quarkonium modification in the quark-gluon plasma consistent among different non-relativistic methods. We also critically discuss the perspectives for improving on these results.",

      "summary": "We present state-of-the-art results for the matrix elements of flavor diagonal tensor operators within the nucleon state. The calculation of the dominant connected contribution is done using eleven ensembles of gauge configurations generated by the MILC Collaboration using the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action with 2+1+1 dynamical flavors. The calculation of the disconnected contributions is done using seven (six) ensembles for the strange (light) quarks. These high-statistics simulations allowed us to address various systematic uncertainties. A simultaneous fit in the lattice spacing and the light-quark mass is used to extract the tensor charges in the continuum limit and at $M_π=135$ MeV. Results for the proton in the $\\overline{MS}$ scheme at 2~GeV are: $g_T^u = 0.784(28)(10)$, $g_T^d = -0.204(11)(10)$ and $g_T^s = -0.0027(16)$. Implications of these results for constraining the quark electric dipole moments and their contributions to the neutron electric dipole moment are discussed.",

      "summary": "Twisted and orbifold formulations of lattice ${\\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory which possess an exact supersymmetry require a $U(N)=SU(N)\\otimes U(1)$ gauge group. In the naive continuum limit, the $U(1)$ modes trivially decouple and play no role in the theory. However, at non-zero lattice spacing they couple to the $SU(N)$ modes and can drive instabilities in the lattice theory. For example, it is well known that the lattice $U(1)$ theory undergoes a phase transition at strong coupling to a chirally broken phase. An improved action that suppresses the fluctuations in the $U(1)$ sector was proposed in arXiv:1505.03135 . Here, we explore a more aggressive approach to the problem by adding a term to the action which can entirely suppress the $U(1)$ mode. The penalty is that the new term breaks the $\\mathcal{Q}$-exact lattice supersymmetry. However, we argue that the term is $1/N^2$ suppressed and the existence of a supersymmetric fixed point in the planar limit ensures that any SUSY-violating terms induced in the action possess couplings that also vanish in this limit. We present numerical results on supersymmetric Ward identities consistent with this conclusion.",

      "summary": "We present our lattice studies of SU(3) gauge theory with $N_f$ = 8 degenerate fermions in the fundamental representation. Using nHYP-smeared staggered fermions we study finite-temperature transitions on lattice volumes as large as $L^3 \\times N_t = 48^3 \\times 24$, and the zero-temperature composite spectrum on lattice volumes up to $64^3 \\times 128$. The spectrum indirectly indicates spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, but finite-temperature transitions with fixed $N_t \\leq 24$ enter a strongly coupled lattice phase as the fermion mass decreases, which prevents a direct confirmation of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the chiral limit. In addition to the connected spectrum we focus on the lightest flavor-singlet scalar particle. We find it to be degenerate with the pseudo-Goldstone states down to the lightest masses reached so far by non-perturbative lattice calculations. Using the same lattice approach, we study the behavior of the composite spectrum when the number of light fermions is changed from eight to four. A heavy flavor-singlet scalar in the 4-flavor theory affirms the contrast between QCD-like dynamics and the low-energy behavior of the 8-flavor theory.",

The calculation was performed with $2+1$ flavors of clover fermions at a pion mass of approximately $320$ MeV, on a $32^3 \\times 96$ lattice with $L\\approx 3.6$ fm. We construct the necessary correlation functions using a combination of smeared forward, sequential and stochastic propagators, and determine the finite-volume matrix elements for all $ππ$ momenta up to $|\\vec{P}|= \\sqrt{3} \\frac{2π}{L}$ and all associated irreducible representations. In the mapping of the finite-volume to infinite-volume matrix elements using the Lellouch-Lüscher factor, we consider two different parametrizations of the $ππ$ scattering phase shift. We fit the $q^2$ and $s$ dependence of the infinite-volume transition amplitude in a model-independent way using series expansions, and compare multiple different truncations of this series. Through analytic continuation to the $ρ$ resonance pole, we also determine the $πγ\\to ρ$ resonant transition form factor and the $ρ$ meson photocoupling, and obtain $|G_{ρπγ}| = 0.0802(32)(20)$.",

To put things in context, we begin by describing the lattice approach to hadronic physics. We point out there is a need for a quark model which can give an overall view of the quark interaction landscape. A new application of the Thomas-Fermi (TF) statistical quark model is described, similar to a previous application to baryons. The main usefulness of this model will be to detect systematic energy trends in the composition of the various particles. It could be a key to identifying {\\it families} of bound states, rather than individual cases. Numerical results based upon a set of parameters derived from a phenomenological model of tetraquarks are given.",

To control the systematics associated with the excited states, we explore {five different source-sink separations}. The nonperturbative renormalization is conducted in a regularization-independent momentum subtraction scheme, and the matching between the renormalized quasi-PDF and $\\bar{\\rm MS}$ PDF is calculated based on perturbative QCD up to one-loop order. Systematic errors due to renormalization and perturbative matching are also analyzed in detail. Our results for lightcone PDF are in reasonable agreement with the latest phenomenological analysis.",

The ML is trained on a subset of background gauge field configurations, called the labeled set, to predict an observable $O$ from the values of correlated, but less compute-intensive, observables $\\mathbf{X}$ calculated on the full sample. By using a second subset, also part of the labeled set, we estimate the bias in the result predicted by the trained ML algorithm. A reduction in the computational cost by about $7\\%-38\\%$ is demonstrated for two different lattice QCD calculations using the Boosted decision tree regression ML algorithm: (1) prediction of the nucleon three-point correlation functions that yield isovector charges from the two-point correlation functions, and (2) prediction of the phase acquired by the neutron mass when a small Charge-Parity (CP) violating interaction, the quark chromoelectric dipole moment interaction, is added to QCD, again from the two-point correlation functions calculated without CP violation.",

At vanishing chemical potential, we report a crossover temperature $T_c(0) = (156.5 \\pm 1.5)\\;\\mathrm{MeV}$ defined by the average of several second-order chiral susceptibilities. For a system with thermal conditions appropriate for a heavy-ion collision, we determined a curvature from the subtracted condensate as $κ_2 = 0.0120(20)$ and from the disconnected susceptibility as $κ_2 = 0.0123(30)$. The next order $κ_4$ is significantly smaller. We also report the crossover temperature as a function of the chemical potentials for: baryon-number, electric charge, strangeness and isospin. Additionally, we find that $T_c(μ_B)$ is in agreement with lines of constant energy density and constant entropy density. Along this crossover line, we study net baryon-number fluctuations and show that their increase is substantially smaller compared to that obtained in HRG model calculations. Similarly, we analyze chiral susceptibility fluctuations along the crossover line and show that these are constant. We conclude that no signs for a narrowing of the crossover region can be found for baryon chemical potential $μ_B < 250\\;\\mathrm{MeV}$.",

      "summary": "We present a lattice calculation of the electromagnetic (EM) effects on the masses of light pseudoscalar mesons. The simulations employ 2+1 dynamical flavors of asqtad QCD quarks, and quenched photons. Lattice spacings vary from $\\approx 0.12$ fm to $\\approx 0.045$ fm. We compute the quantity $ε$, which parameterizes the corrections to Dashen's theorem for the $K^+$-$K^0$ EM mass splitting, as well as $ε_{K^0}$, which parameterizes the EM contribution to the mass of the $K^0$ itself. An extension of the nonperturbative EM renormalization scheme introduced by the BMW group is used in separating EM effects from isospin-violating quark mass effects. We correct for leading finite-volume effects in our realization of lattice electrodynamics in chiral perturbation theory, and remaining finite-volume errors are relatively small. While electroquenched effects are under control for $ε$, they are estimated only qualitatively for $ε_{K^0}$, and constitute one of the largest sources of uncertainty for that quantity. We find $ε= 0.78(1)_{\\rm stat}({}^{+\\phantom{1}8}_{-11})_{\\rm syst}$ and $ε_{K^0}=0.035(3)_{\\rm stat}(20)_{\\rm syst}$.

Using recent lattice data with $m_1=m_2$ and $N_1+N_2$= 8 or 12, we predict the mass splittings for $m_2=m_1+δm$. At first order in $δm$, an interesting inverted pattern appears in the $0^{++}$ sector, where mesons with lighter fermions are heavier. This feature could be tested in ongoing calculations provided that $m_1$ and $δm$ are sufficiently small. We discuss possible improvements of the approach.",

      "summary": "Quantum physics frequently involves a need to count the states, subspaces, measurement outcomes, and other elements of quantum dynamics. However, with quantum mechanics assigning probabilities to such objects, it is often desirable to work with the notion of a \"total\" that takes into account their varied relevance. For example, such an effective count of position states available to a lattice electron could characterize its localization properties. Similarly, the effective total of outcomes in the measurement step of a quantum computation relates to the efficiency of the quantum algorithm. Despite a broad need for effective counting, a well-founded prescription has not been formulated. Instead, the assignments that do not respect the measure-like nature of the concept, such as versions of the participation number or exponentiated entropies, are used in some areas. Here, we develop the additive theory of effective number functions (ENFs), namely functions assigning consistent totals to collections of objects endowed with probability weights. Our analysis reveals the existence of a minimal total, realized by the unique ENF, which leads to effective counting with absolute meaning. Touching upon the nature of the measure, our results may find applications not only in quantum physics, but also in other quantitative sciences.",

If the deformed manifold is the appropriate combination of Lefschetz thimbles -- or somewhat close to them -- the sign problem is alleviated. Gauge theories lack a well-defined thimble decomposition, and therefore it is unclear how to carry out a generalized thimble method.

In the present paper we describe the details of this calculation, which includes the implementation of a number of novel techniques. The $K^+\\toπ^+ν\\barν$ decay amplitude is dominated by short-distance contributions which can be computed in perturbation theory with the only required non-perturbative input being the relatively well-known form factors of semileptonic kaon decays. The long-distance contributions, which are the target of this work, are expected to be of O(5%) in the branching ratio. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of lattice QCD computations of the $K^+\\toπ^+ν\\barν$ decay amplitude, and in particular of the long-distance component. Though this calculation is performed on a small lattice ($16^3\\times32$) and at unphysical pion, kaon and charm quark masses, $m_π=420$ MeV, $m_K=563$ MeV and $m_c^{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}(\\mbox{2 GeV})=863$ MeV, the techniques presented in this work can readily be applied to a future realistic calculation.",

      "title": "Quark contribution to the proton spin from 2+1+1-flavor lattice QCD",
      "summary": "We present the first chiral-continuum extrapolated up, down and strange quark spin contribution to the proton spin using lattice QCD. For the connected contributions, we use eleven ensembles of 2+1+1-flavor of Highly Improved Staggered Quarks (HISQ) generated by the MILC Collaboration. They cover four lattice spacings $a \\approx \\{0.15,0.12,0.09,0.06\\}$ fm and three pion masses, $M_π\\approx \\{315,220,135\\}$ MeV, of which two are at the physical pion mass. The disconnected strange calculations are done on seven of these ensembles, covering the four lattice spacings but only one with the physical pion mass. The disconnected light quark calculation was done on six ensembles at two values of $M_π\\approx \\{315,220\\}$ MeV. High-statistics estimates on each ensemble for all three quantities allow us to quantify systematic uncertainties and perform a simultaneous chiral-continuum extrapolation in the lattice spacing and the light-quark mass. Our final results are $Δu \\equiv \\langle 1 \\rangle_{Δu^+} = 0.777(25)(30)$, $Δd \\equiv \\langle 1 \\rangle_{Δd^+} = -0.438(18)(30)$, and $Δs \\equiv \\langle 1 \\rangle_{Δs^+} = -0.053(8)$, adding up to a total quark contribution to proton spin of $\\sum_{q=u,d,s} (\\frac{1}{2} Δq) = 0.143(31)(36)$. The second error is the systematic uncertainty associated with the chiral-continuum extrapolation. These results are obtained without model assumptions and are in good agreement with the recent COMPASS analysis $0.13 < \\frac{1}{2} ΔΣ< 0.18$, and with the $Δq$ obtained from various global analyses of polarized beam or target data.",

      "summary": "We present high statistics results for the isovector charges $g^{u-d}_A$, $g^{u-d}_S$ and $g^{u-d}_T$ of the nucleon. Calculations were carried out on eleven ensembles of gauge configurations generated by the MILC collaboration using highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ) action with 2+1+1 dynamical flavors. These ensembles span four lattice spacings $a \\approx$ 0.06, 0.09, 0.12 and 0.15 fm and light-quark masses corresponding to $M_π\\approx$ 135, 225 and 315 MeV. Excited-state contamination in the nucleon 3-point correlation functions is controlled by including up to three-states in the spectral decomposition. Remaining systematic uncertainties associated with lattice discretization, lattice volume and light-quark masses are controlled using a simultaneous fit in these three variables. Our final estimates of the isovector charges in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme at 2 GeV are $g_A^{u-d} = 1.218(25)(30)$, $g_S^{u-d} = 1.022(80)(60) $ and $g_T^{u-d} = 0.989(32)(10)$. The first error includes statistical and all systematic uncertainties except that due to the extrapolation ansatz, which is given by the second error estimate. We provide a detailed comparison with the recent result of $g_A^{u-d} = 1.271(13)$ by the CalLat collaboration and argue that our error estimate is more realistic. Combining our estimate for $g_S^{u-d}$ with the difference of light quarks masses $(m_d-m_u)^{\\rm QCD}=2.572(66)$ MeV given by the MILC/Fermilab/TUMQCD collaboration for 2+1+1-flavor theory, we obtain $(M_N-M_P)^{\\rm QCD} = 2.63(27)$ MeV. We update the low-energy constraints on novel scalar and tensor interactions, $ε_{S}$ and $ε_{T}$, at the TeV scale by combining our new estimates for $g^{u-d}_S$ and $g^{u-d}_T$ with precision low-energy nuclear experiments, and find them comparable to those from the ATLAS and the CMS experiments at the LHC.",

      "summary": "We calculate the intrinsic quark spin contribution to the total proton spin using overlap valence quarks on three ensembles of $2+1$-flavor RBC/UKQCD domain-wall configurations with different lattice spacings. The lowest pion mass of the ensembles is around 171 MeV which is close to the physical point. With overlap fermions and topological charge derived from the overlap operator, we verify the anomalous Ward identity between nucleon states with momentum transfer. Both the connected and disconnected insertions of the axial-vector current are calculated. For the disconnected-insertion part, the cluster-decomposition error reduction (CDER) technique is utilized for the lattice with the largest volume and the error can be reduced by $10\\%\\sim40\\%$. Nonperturbative renormalization is carried out and the final results are all reported in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme at 2 GeV. We determine the total quark spin contribution to the nucleon spin to be $ΔΣ=0.401(25)(37)$, which is consistent with the recent global fitting result of experimental data. The isovector axial coupling we obtain in this study is $g_A^3=1.256(16)(30)$, which agrees well with the experimental value of 1.2723(23).",

The construction requires that the fermions be treated as Kähler-Dirac fields and the condensate arises from an anomaly associated with a $U(1)$ global symmetry which is subsequently broken to a discrete subgroup. Remarkably the anomaly survives under discretization of the space which allows us to compute the condensate on an arbitrary triangulation. The results, being topological in character, should hold in a wide range of gravitationally coupled fermion theories both classical and quantum",

For this purpose, we employ an existing coupled-channel study involving $\\bar{K} N$, $πΛ$, and $πΣ$ interactions in the $S=-1$ sector. A novel method is proposed to extract an effective phase shift due to the interaction, which can subsequently be used to compute various thermal observables via a relativistic virial expansion. As an application of the calculation scheme, we compute the correlation of the net baryon number with strangeness ($χ_{BS}$) for an interacting hadron gas. We show that the S-matrix approach, which entails a consistent treatment of resonances and naturally incorporates the additional hyperon states which are not listed by the Particle Data Group, leads to an improved description of the lattice data over the Hadron Resonance Gas model.",

      "summary": "Sign problems in path integrals arise when different field configurations contribute with different signs or phases. Phase unwrapping describes a family of signal processing techniques in which phase differences between elements of a time series are integrated to construct non-compact unwrapped phase differences. By combining phase unwrapping with a cumulant expansion, path integrals with sign problems arising from phase fluctuations can be systematically approximated as linear combinations of path integrals without sign problems. This work explores phase unwrapping in zero-plus-one-dimensional complex scalar field theory. Results with improved signal-to-noise ratios for the spectrum of scalar field theory can be obtained from unwrapped phases, but the size of cumulant expansion truncation errors is found to be undesirably sensitive to the parameters of the phase unwrapping algorithm employed. It is argued that this numerical sensitivity arises from discretization artifacts that become large when phases fluctuate close to singularities of a complex logarithm in the definition of the unwrapped phase.",

      "title": "A percent-level determination of the nucleon axial coupling from Quantum Chromodynamics",
      "summary": "The $\\textit{axial coupling of the nucleon}$, $g_A$, is the strength of its coupling to the $\\textit{weak}$ axial current of the Standard Model of particle physics, in much the same way as the electric charge is the strength of the coupling to the electromagnetic current. This axial coupling dictates the rate at which neutrons decay to protons, the strength of the attractive long-range force between nucleons and other features of nuclear physics. Precision tests of the Standard Model in nuclear environments require a quantitative understanding of nuclear physics rooted in Quantum Chromodynamics, a pillar of the Standard Model. The prominence of $g_A$ makes it a benchmark quantity to determine theoretically - a difficult task because quantum chromodynamics is non-perturbative, precluding known analytical methods. Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics provides a rigorous, non-perturbative definition of quantum chromodynamics that can be implemented numerically. It has been estimated that a precision of two percent would be possible by 2020 if two challenges are overcome: contamination of $g_A$ from excited states must be controlled in the calculations and statistical precision must be improved markedly. Here we report a calculation of $g_A^{QCD} = 1.271\\pm0.013$, using an unconventional method inspired by the Feynman-Hellmann theorem that overcomes these challenges.",

Higher order fluctuations at $μ_B=0$ are obtained as derivatives of the lower order ones, simulated at imaginary chemical potential.

Our results qualitatively explain the behavior of the measured cumulant ratios by the STAR collaboration.",

The calculation is performed for the quark-connected light-quark contribution in the isospin symmetric limit. We take into account the effects of backward state propagation by extending a temporal boundary condition. In addition we study a quark-mass correction to tune to the exactly same physical pion mass on different volume and compare those correction with chiral perturbation.

      "summary": "Observation of neutrinoless double beta decay, a lepton number violating process that has been proposed to clarify the nature of neutrino masses, has spawned an enormous world-wide experimental effort. Relating nuclear decay rates to high-energy, beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics requires detailed knowledge of non-perturbative QCD effects. Using lattice QCD, we compute the necessary matrix elements of short-range operators, which arise due to heavy BSM mediators, that contribute to this decay via the leading order $π^- \\to π^+$ exchange diagrams. Utilizing our result and taking advantage of effective field theory methods will allow for model-independent calculations of the relevant two-nucleon decay, which may then be used as input for nuclear many-body calculations of the relevant experimental decays. Contributions from short-range operators may prove to be equally important to, or even more important than, those from long-range Majorana neutrino exchange.",

      "summary": "Spatially non-local matrix elements are useful lattice-QCD observables in a variety of contexts, for example in determining hadron structure. To quote credible estimates of the systematic uncertainties in these calculations, one must understand, among other things, the size of the finite-volume effects when such matrix elements are extracted from numerical lattice calculations. In this work, we estimate finite-volume effects for matrix elements of non-local operators, composed of two currents displaced in a spatial direction by a distance $ξ$. We find that the finite-volume corrections depend on the details of the matrix element. If the external state is the lightest degree of freedom in the theory, e.g.~the pion in QCD, then the volume corrections scale as $ e^{-m_π(L- ξ)} $, where $m_π$ is the mass of the light state. For heavier external states the usual $e^{- m_πL}$ form is recovered, but with a polynomial prefactor of the form $L^m/|L - ξ|^n$ that can lead to enhanced volume effects. These observations are potentially relevant to a wide variety of observables being studied using lattice QCD, including parton distribution functions, double-beta-decay and Compton-scattering matrix elements, and long-range weak matrix elements.",

The main result of this work is that our action suffers no significant sign problem for any spin polarization in the region relevant for dilute degenerate fermi gases. This lack of sign problem allows us to study attractive spin polarized fermions non-perturbatively at spin polarizations not previously explored. For some parameters values we verify results previously obtained by methods which include an uncontrolled step like complex Langevin and/or analytical continuation from imaginary chemical potential. For others, larger values of the polarization, we deviate from these previous results.",

      "summary": "The application of a uniform background magnetic field makes standard quark operators utilising gauge-covariant Gaussian smearing inefficient at isolating the ground state nucleon at nontrivial field strengths. In the absence of QCD interactions, Landau modes govern the quark energy levels. There is evidence that residual Landau mode effects remain when the strong interaction is turned on. Here we introduce novel quark operators constructed from the two-dimensional $U(1)$ Laplacian eigenmodes that describe the Landau levels of a charged particle on a periodic finite lattice. These eigenmode-projected quark operators provide enhanced precision for calculating nucleon energy shifts in a magnetic field. Using asymmetric source and sink operators, we are able to encapsulate the predominant effects of both the QCD and QED interactions in the interpolating fields for the neutron. The neutron magnetic polarizability is calculated using these techniques on the $32^3 \\times 64$ dynamical QCD lattices provided by the PACS-CS Collaboration. In conjunction with a chiral effective-field theory analysis, we obtain a neutron magnetic polarizability of $β^n = 2.05(25)(19) \\times 10^{-4}$ fm$^3$, where the numbers in parentheses describe statistical and systematic uncertainties.",

      "summary": "Lattice gauge theories are fundamental to our understanding of high-energy physics. Nevertheless, the search for suitable platforms for their quantum simulation has proven difficult. We show that the Abelian Higgs model in 1+1 dimensions is a prime candidate for an experimental quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory. To this end, we use a discrete tensor reformulation to smoothly connect the space-time isotropic version used in most numerical lattice simulations to the continuous-time limit corresponding to the Hamiltonian formulation. The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are neutral for periodic boundary conditions, but we probe the nonzero charge sectors by either introducing a Polyakov loop or an external electric field. In both cases we obtain universal functions relating the mass gap, the gauge coupling, and the spatial size which are invariant under the deformation of the temporal lattice spacing. We propose to use a physical multi-leg ladder of atoms trapped in optical lattices and interacting with Rydberg-dressed interactions to quantum simulate the model and check the universal features. Our results provide a path to the analog quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories with atoms in optical lattices.",

The construction is tested numerically for the two-dimensional $φ^4$ scalar field theory on the Riemann two-sphere, $\\mathbb{S}^2$, in comparison with the exact solutions to the two-dimensional Ising conformal field theory (CFT).

In contrast to our previous physical-pion PDF result, we increase the statistics significantly, double the boost momentum, increase the investment in excited-state contamination systematics, and switch to $γ_t$ operator to avoid mixing with scalar matrix elements. We use four source-sink separations in our analysis to control the systematics associated with excited-state contamination. The one-loop LaMET matching corresponding to the new operator is calculated and applied to our lattice data. We detail the systematics that affect PDF calculations, providing guidelines to improve the precision of future lattice PDF calculations.

In addition, we show how the integral equations that relate the intermediate three-particle infinite-volume scattering quantity, $\\mathcal K_{\\text{df},3}$, to the physical scattering amplitude can be solved at and below threshold. We test our methods by reproducing known analytic results for the $1/L$ expansion of the threshold state, the volume dependence of three-particle bound-state energies, and the Bethe-Salpeter wavefunctions for these bound states. We also find that certain values of $\\mathcal K_{\\text{df},3}$ lead to unphysical finite-volume energies, and give a preliminary analysis of these artifacts.",

      "summary": "We present a quantum-classical algorithm to study the dynamics of the two-spatial-site Schwinger model on IBM's quantum computers. Using rotational symmetries, total charge, and parity, the number of qubits needed to perform computation is reduced by a factor of $\\sim 5$, removing exponentially-large unphysical sectors from the Hilbert space. Our work opens an avenue for exploration of other lattice quantum field theories, such as quantum chromodynamics, where classical computation is used to find symmetry sectors in which the quantum computer evaluates the dynamics of quantum fluctuations.",

Non-perturbative renormalization is employed and the lattice data are converted to the MSbar-scheme at a scale of 2 GeV. A matching process is applied together with target mass corrections leading to the reconstruction of light-cone parton distribution functions. For both cases we find a similar behavior between the lattice and phenomenological data, and for the polarized PDF a nice overlap for a range of Bjorken-x values. This presents a major success for the emerging field of direct calculations of quark distributions using lattice QCD.",

      "summary": "We present the first determination of $ρπ$ scattering, incorporating dynamically-coupled partial-waves, using lattice QCD, a first-principles numerical approach to QCD. Considering the case of isospin-2 $ρπ$, we calculate partial-wave amplitudes with $J \\le 3$ and determine the degree of dynamical mixing between the coupled $S$ and $D$-wave channels with $J^P=1^+$. The analysis makes use of the relationship between scattering amplitudes and the discrete spectrum of states in the finite volume lattice. Constraints on the scattering amplitudes are provided by over one hundred energy levels computed on two lattice volumes at various overall momenta and in several irreducible representations of the relevant symmetry groups. The spectra follow from variational analyses of matrices of correlations functions computed with large bases of meson-meson operators. Calculations are performed with degenerate light and strange quarks tuned to the physical strange quark mass so that $m_π\\sim 700$ MeV, ensuring that the $ρ$ is stable against strong decay. This work demonstrates the successful application of techniques, opening the door to calculations of scattering processes that incorporate the effects of dynamically-coupled partial-waves, including those involving resonances or bound states.",

      "summary": "We calculate the up-, down-, strange-, charm-, and bottom-quark masses using the MILC highly improved staggered-quark ensembles with four flavors of dynamical quarks. We use ensembles at six lattice spacings ranging from $a\\approx0.15$~fm to $0.03$~fm and with both physical and unphysical values of the two light and the strange sea-quark masses. We use a new method based on heavy-quark effective theory (HQET) to extract quark masses from heavy-light pseudoscalar meson masses. Combining our analysis with our separate determination of ratios of light-quark masses we present masses of the up, down, strange, charm, and bottom quarks. Our results for the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$-renormalized masses are $m_u(2~\\text{GeV}) = 2.130(41)$~MeV, $m_d(2~\\text{GeV}) = 4.675(56)$~MeV, $m_s(2~\\text{GeV}) = 92.47(69)$~MeV, $m_c(3~\\text{GeV}) = 983.7(5.6)$~MeV, and $m_c(m_c) = 1273(10)$~MeV, with four active flavors; and $m_b(m_b) = 4195(14)$~MeV with five active flavors. We also obtain ratios of quark masses $m_c/m_s = 11.783(25)$, $m_b/m_s = 53.94(12)$, and $m_b/m_c = 4.578(8)$. The result for $m_c$ matches the precision of the most precise calculation to date, and the other masses and all quoted ratios are the most precise to date. Moreover, these results are the first with a perturbative accuracy of $α_s^4$. As byproducts of our method, we obtain the matrix elements of HQET operators with dimension 4 and 5: $\\overlineΛ_\\text{MRS}=555(31)$~MeV in the minimal renormalon-subtracted (MRS) scheme, $μ_π^2 = 0.05(22)~\\text{GeV}^2$, and $μ_G^2(m_b)=0.38(2)~\\text{GeV}^2$. The MRS scheme [Phys. Rev. D97, 034503 (2018), arXiv:1712.04983 [hep-ph]] is the key new aspect of our method.",

A large spatial extent of $L = 3.7\\mathrm{fm}$ enables a good energy resolution while partial wave mixing due to the reduced symmetries of the finite volume is treated explicitly.The $p$-wave amplitude is well described by a Breit-Wigner shape with parameters $m_{K^{*}}/m_π = 3.808(18)$ and $g^{\\mathrm{BW}}_{K^{*}Kπ} = 5.33(20)$ which are insensitive to the inclusion of $d$-wave mixing and variation of the $s$-wave parametrization.

      "summary": "We report Lee-Yang zeros behavior at finite temperature and density. The quark number densities, <n>, are calculated at the pure imaginary chemical potential, where no sign problem occurs. Then, the canonical partition functions, Z_C(n,T,V), up to some maximal values of n are estimated through fitting theoretically motivated functions to <n>, which are used to compute the Lee-Yang zeros. We study the temperature dependence of the distributions of the Lee-Yang zeros around the pseudo-critical temperature region T/T_c = 0.84 - 1.35. In the distributions of the Lee-Yang zeros, we observe the Roberge-Weiss phase transition at T/T_c >= 1.20. We discuss the dependence of the behaviors of Lee-Yang zeros on the maximal value of n, so that we can estimate a reliable infinite volume limit.",

In addition, we present results for the disconnected light quark contributions to the nucleon electromagnetic form factors. Improved stochastic methods are employed leading to high-precision results. The momentum dependence of the disconnected contributions is fitted using the model-independent z-expansion. We extract the magnetic moment and the electric and magnetic radii of the proton and neutron by including both connected and disconnected contributions. We find that the disconnected light quark contributions to both electric and magnetic form factors are non-zero and at the few percent level as compared to the connected. The strange form factors are also at the percent level but more noisy yielding statistical errors that are typically within one standard deviation from a zero value.",

Here we formulate a multi-grid algorithm for the Kogut-Susskind (or staggered) fermion discretization which has proven difficult relative to Wilson multigrid due to its first-order anti-Hermitian structure. The solution is to introduce a novel spectral transformation by the Kähler-Dirac spin structure prior to the Galerkin projection. We present numerical results for the two-dimensional, two-flavor Schwinger model, however, the general formalism is agnostic to dimension and is directly applicable to four-dimensional lattice QCD.",

      "summary": "We investigate the lattice spacing dependence of the equilibration time for a recently proposed multiscale thermalization algorithm for Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. The algorithm uses a renormalization-group matched coarse lattice action and prolongation operation to rapidly thermalize decorrelated initial configurations for evolution using a corresponding target lattice action defined at a finer scale. Focusing on non-topological long-distance observables in pure SU(3) gauge theory, we provide quantitative evidence that the slow modes of the Markov process, which provide the dominant contribution to the rethermalization time, have a suppressed contribution toward the continuum limit, despite their associated timescales increasing. Based on these numerical investigations, we conjecture that the prolongation operation used herein will produce ensembles that are indistinguishable from the target fine-action distribution for a sufficiently fine coupling at a given level of statistical precision, thereby eliminating the cost of rethermalization.",

This model is closely related to a composite Higgs model in which the chimera baryon made up of fermions from both representations plays the role of a composite top-quark partner. The dependence of the baryon masses on each underlying fermion mass is found to be generally consistent with a quark-model description and large-Nc scaling. We combine our numerical results with experimental bounds on the scale of the new strong sector to derive a lower bound on the mass of the top partner.",

Such studies require significant computing resources to undertake. A number of proposed methods promise improved efficiency of lattice calculations, and access to regions of parameter space that are currently computationally intractable, via multi-scale action-matching approaches that necessitate parametric regression of generated lattice datasets. The applicability of machine learning to this regression task is investigated, with deep neural networks found to provide an efficient solution even in cases where approaches such as principal component analysis fail. The high information content and complex symmetries inherent in lattice QCD datasets require custom neural network layers to be introduced and present opportunities for further development.",

      "summary": "In a large-momentum nucleon state, the matrix element of a gauge-invariant Euclidean Wilson line operator accessible from lattice QCD can be related to the standard light-cone parton distribution function through the large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) expansion. This relation is given by a factorization theorem with a non-trivial matching coefficient. Using the operator product expansion we prove the large-momentum factorization of the quasi-parton distribution function in LaMET, and show that the more recently discussed Ioffe-time distribution approach also obeys an equivalent factorization theorem. Explicit results for the coefficients are obtained and compared at one-loop. Our proof clearly demonstrates that the matching coefficients in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme depend on the large partonic momentum rather than the nucleon momentum.",

      "summary": "We show that the correct way to extract parton distribution functions from the reduced Ioffe-time distribution (RITD), a ratio of the Ioffe-time distribution for a moving hadron and a hadron at rest, is through a factorization formula. This factorization exists because, at small distances, forming the ratio does not change the infrared behavior of the numerator, which is factorizable. We illustrate the effect of such a factorization by applying it to results in the literature.",

      "summary": "We present a numerical study of three-dimensional two-color QCD with $N=0, 2, 4, 8$ and 12 flavors of massless two-component fermions using parity-preserving improved Wilson-Dirac fermions. A finite volume analysis provides strong evidence for the presence of $Sp(N)$ symmetry-breaking bilinear condensate when $N \\le 2$ and its absence for $N \\ge 8$. A weaker evidence for the bilinear condensate is shown for $N=4$. We estimate the critical number of flavors below which scale-invariance is broken by the bilinear condensate to be between $N=4$ and 6.",

      "summary": "We present results for the isovector axial, induced pseudoscalar, electric, and magnetic form factors of the nucleon. The calculations were done using $2+1+1$-flavor HISQ ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration with lattice spacings $a \\approx$ 0.12, 0.09, 0.06$\\mathrm{fm}$ and pion masses $M_π\\approx$ 310, 220, 130$\\mathrm{MeV}$. Excited-states contamination is controlled by using four-state fits to two-point correlators and by comparing two- versus three-states in three-point correlators. The $Q^2$ behavior is analyzed using the model independent z-expansion and the dipole ansatz. Final results for the charge radii and magnetic moment are obtained using a simultaneous fit in $M_π$, lattice spacing $a$ and finite volume.",
