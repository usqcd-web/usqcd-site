      "title": "$B$-meson semileptonic form factors on (2+1+1)-flavor HISQ ensembles",
      "summary": "We report updates to an ongoing lattice-QCD calculation of the form factors for the semileptonic decays $B \\to π\\ell ν$, $B_s \\to K \\ell ν$, $B \\to π\\ell^+ \\ell^-$, and $B \\to K \\ell^+ \\ell^-$. The tree-level decays $B_{(s)} \\to π(K) \\ell ν$ enable precise determinations of the CKM matrix element $|V_{ub}|$, while the flavor-changing neutral-current interactions $B \\to π(K) \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ are sensitive to contributions from new physics. This work uses MILC's (2+1+1)-flavor HISQ ensembles at approximate lattice spacings between $0.057$ and $0.15$ fm, with physical sea-quark masses on four out of the seven ensembles. The valence sector is comprised of a clover $b$ quark (in the Fermilab interpretation) and HISQ light and $s$ quarks. We present preliminary results for the form factors $f_0$, $f_+$, and $f_T$, including studies of systematic errors.",

      "title": "Implementation of the HMC algorithm on the tempered Lefschetz thimble method",
      "summary": "The tempered Lefschetz thimble method (TLTM) is a parallel-tempering algorithm towards solving the numerical sign problem, where the system is tempered by the antiholomorphic gradient flow to tame both the sign and ergodicity problems simultaneously. In this paper, we implement the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm for transitions on each flowed surface, expecting that this implementation on TLTM will give a useful framework for future computations of large-scale systems including fermions. Although the use of HMC in Lefschetz thimble methods has been proposed so far, our crucial achievement here is that HMC is implemented on TLTM so as to work within the parallel-tempering algorithm in TLTM, especially by developing an algorithm to handle zeros of fermion determinants in the course of the molecular-dynamics process. We confirm that the algorithm works correctly by applying it to the sign problem of the Hubbard model on a small lattice, for which the TLTM is known to work with the Metropolis algorithm. We show that the use of HMC significantly reduces the autocorrelation times with less computational times compared to the Metropolis algorithm.",

      "summary": "Motivated by the fermion bag approach we construct a new class of Hamiltonian lattice field theories that can help us to study fermionic quantum critical points, particularly those with four-fermion interactions. Although these theories are constructed in discrete-time with a finite temporal lattice spacing $\\varepsilon$, when $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow 0$, conventional continuous-time Hamiltonian lattice field theories are recovered. The fermion bag algorithms run relatively faster when $\\varepsilon=1$ as compared to $\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$, but still allow us to compute universal quantities near the quantum critical point even at such a large value of $\\varepsilon$. As an example of this new approach, here we study the $N_f=1$ Gross-Neveu chiral Ising universality class in $2+1$ dimensions by calculating the critical scaling of the staggered mass order parameter. We show that we are able to study lattice sizes up to $100^2$ sites when $\\varepsilon=1$, while with comparable resources we can only reach lattice sizes of up to $64^2$ when $\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$. The critical exponents obtained in both these studies match within errors.",

      "summary": "Experimentally the existence of a light 125 GeV Higgs boson is well established but so far no other heavier resonances have been observed. Viable models to describe the Higgs boson as composite particle require hence to exhibit a large separation of scales. This occurs naturally in systems located near a conformal fixed point irrespective whether the system lies outside or inside the conformal window. We demonstrate the latter case by investigating a mass-split model with four light and six heavy flavors. By construction mass-split models exhibit a large separation of scales and feature in addition a highly constrained hadron spectrum. We present results based on the low-lying connected meson spectrum. Although the light sector is chirally broken, we show that it exhibits hyperscaling which is typical for conformal systems.",

      "title": "Lattice Analysis of $SU(2)$ with 1 Adjoint Dirac Flavor",
      "summary": "Recently $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory with one massless adjoint Dirac quark flavor emerges as a novel critical theory that can describe the evolution between a trivial insulator and a topological insulator in AIII class in $3+1$ dimensions. There are several classes of conjectured infrared dynamics for this theory. One possibility is that the theory undergoes spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, with two massless Goldstone bosons (the scalar diquark and its antiparticle) in the infrared. Another scenario, which is suggested by previous lattice studies by Athenodorou et al., is that the IR sector of the theory is a strongly interacting conformal field theory as the quark mass vanishes. The most recent theoretical proposals argue for a case that in the infrared a composite fermion composed of two quarks and an antiquark becomes massless and non-interacting as the quark mass goes to zero, while other sectors are decoupled from this low-energy fermion. This work expands upon previous studies by including the composite fermion to investigate which of these three potential scenarios captures the infrared behavior of this theory.",

      "title": "Framework for simulating gauge theories with dipolar spin systems",
      "summary": "Gauge theories appear broadly in physics, ranging from the standard model of particle physics to long-wavelength descriptions of topological systems in condensed matter. However, systems with sign problems are largely inaccessible to classical computations and also beyond the current limitations of digital quantum hardware. In this work, we develop an analog approach to simulating gauge theories with an experimental setup that employs dipolar spins (molecules or Rydberg atoms). We consider molecules fixed in space and interacting through dipole-dipole interactions, avoiding the need for itinerant degrees of freedom. Each molecule represents either a site or gauge degree of freedom, and Gauss law is preserved by a direct and programmatic tuning of positions and internal state energies. This approach can be regarded as a form of analog systems programming and charts a path forward for near-term quantum simulation. As a first step, we numerically validate this scheme in a small-system study of U(1) quantum link models in (1+1) dimensions with link spin S = 1/2 and S = 1 and illustrate how dynamical phenomena such as string inversion and string breaking could be observed in near-term experiments. Our work brings together methods from atomic and molecular physics, condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and quantum information science for the study of nonperturbative processes in gauge theories.",

      "summary": "The nucleon axial coupling, $g_A$, is a fundamental property of protons and neutrons, dictating the strength with which the weak axial current of the Standard Model couples to nucleons, and hence, the lifetime of a free neutron. The prominence of $g_A$ in nuclear physics has made it a benchmark quantity with which to calibrate lattice QCD calculations of nucleon structure and more complex calculations of electroweak matrix elements in one and few nucleon systems. There were a number of significant challenges in determining $g_A$, notably the notorious exponentially-bad signal-to-noise problem and the requirement for hundreds of thousands of stochastic samples, that rendered this goal more difficult to obtain than originally thought.\n  I will describe the use of an unconventional computation method, coupled with \"ludicrously'\" fast GPU code, access to publicly available lattice QCD configurations from MILC and access to leadership computing that have allowed these challenges to be overcome resulting in a determination of $g_A$ with 1% precision and all sources of systematic uncertainty controlled. I will discuss the implications of these results for the convergence of $SU(2)$ Chiral Perturbation theory for nucleons, as well as prospects for further improvements to $g_A$ (sub-percent precision, for which we have preliminary results) which is part of a more comprehensive application of lattice QCD to nuclear physics. This is particularly exciting in light of the new CORAL supercomputers coming online, Sierra and Summit, for which our lattice QCD codes achieve a machine-to-machine speed up over Titan of an order of magnitude.",

      "summary": "Extracting excited states from lattice gauge theory correlation functions can be achieved through chi-squared minimization fits or algebraic approaches such as the variational method and Prony's method. Performing any kind of error analysis, such as bootstrap resampling, often leads to overlapping confidence regions of model parameters, even when the spectrum is not particularly dense. In order to correctly estimate errors, one must beware of mislabeling the states. In this work, we provide an algorithm that we call automated label flows which consistently and systematically identifies a deterministic labeling of states. In the context of Prony's method, we analyze lattice correlation functions by using automated label flows, and compare the results to fits obtained from chi-square minimization fits to exponentials.",

      "summary": "We present updated results for the non-perturbative $β$-function of SU(3) gauge theories with $N_f = 12$ or 10 massless flavors in the fundamental rep or $N_f = 2$ in the sextet rep, measured with staggered fermions. New data at finer lattice spacing and our previously introduced method, the infinitesimal $β$-function, strengthen the case that the $N_f = 12$ model has no infrared fixed point up to $g^2 = 7.2$. We show how underestimated cutoff dependence in one domain wall study for $N_f = 10$ has been corrected, which is now consistent with staggered results showing a monotonically increasing $β$-function. A consistent theme is that too small volumes can lead to apparent fixed points which vanish towards the continuum limit. We also apply the infinitesimal $β$-function method to the $N_f = 10$ model, finding consistent behavior with the finite-step $β$-function. Ongoing simulations and analysis for the sextet model confirm our previous results from weak to strong coupling with a non-zero $β$-function throughout, in quantitative difference to Wilson fermion simulations~\\cite{Hasenfratz:2015ssa}.",

      "summary": "Holographic Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) are usually studied in a limit where the gravity description is weakly coupled. By contrast, lattice quantum field theory can be used as a tool for doing computations in a wider class of holographic CFTs where gravity remains weak but nongravitational interactions {\\it in AdS} become strong. We take preliminary steps for studying such theories on the lattice by constructing the discretized theory of a scalar field in AdS$_2$ and investigating its approach to the continuum limit in the free and perturbative regimes. Our main focus is on finite sub-lattices of maximally symmetric tilings of hyperbolic space. Up to boundary effects, these tilings preserve the triangle group as a large discrete subgroup of AdS$_2$, but have a minimum lattice spacing that is comparable to the radius of curvature of the underlying spacetime. We quantify the effects of the lattice spacing as well as the boundary effects, and find that they can be accurately modeled by modifications within the framework of the continuum limit description. We also show how to do refinements of the lattice that shrink the lattice spacing at the cost of breaking the triangle group symmetry of the maximally symmetric tilings.",

Thus, we investigate several possible ways to renormalize the quasi-PDF operators in high accuracy with non-perturbative calculation using the quench configurations at several lattice spacings. We find that the ratio of the UV divergences obtained from the Wilson loop and off-shell quasi-PDF operator is not a constant of the Wilson link length $z$. Although the linear divergence in them may be consistent to each other numerically, there is some additional UV divergence in the quasi-PDF operator.",

      "summary": "This document outlines the usage of a series of python 2.7 scripts designed to easily and efficiently create compound operators. This is accomplished by computing tensor products of smaller building blocks that transform irreducibly under lattice cubic rotational and translational symmetry. In particular, the code has the ability to handle representations of the cubic rotation group with any spatial momentum. The key paradigm is to track the momentum separately from the rotations, fully utilizing the abelian structure of the translation subgroup. This goes through the Wigner little group method to classify the subgroup of rotations that leave the momentum direction unchanged. Using little groups circumvents the issue of a volume factor in the number of representation matrices that are needed, instead only requiring the 96 cubic rotation representation matrices. Tensor products are computed with character tables and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are saved for each decomposition in the tensor product. The code also builds operators in a consistent basis, ensuring that operators that transform in the same representation have the same properties.",

While the increase in computational power has allowed scientists to better evaluate the underlying model, the size of these computational projects have grown to a point where a framework is desired to facilitate managing the workflow. A typical scientific computing workflow includes: Defining all input parameters for every step of the computation; Defining dependencies of computational tasks; Storing some of the output data; Post-processing these data files; Performing data analysis on output. EspressoDB is a programmatic object-relational data management framework implemented in Python and based on the Django web framework. EspressoDB was developed to streamline data management workflows, centralize and guarantee data integrity, while providing domain flexibility and ease of use. The framework provided by EspressoDB aims to support the ever increasing complexity of workflows of scientific computing at leadership computing facilities, with the goal of reducing the amount of human time required to manage the jobs, thus giving scientists more time to focus on science.",

      "summary": "Correlations and measures of entanglement in ground state wavefunctions of relativistic quantum field theories are spatially localized over length scales set by the mass of the lightest particle. We utilize this localization to design digital quantum circuits for preparing the ground states of lattice scalar quantum field theories. Controlled rotations that are exponentially localized in their position-space extent are found to provide exponentially convergent wavefunction fidelity. These angles scale with the correlation between sites and the classical two-point correlation function, as opposed to the more localized mutual information or the hyper-localized negativity. We anticipate that further investigations will uncover quantum circuit designs with controlled rotations dictated by the measures of entanglement. This work is expected to impact quantum simulations of systems of importance to nuclear physics, high-energy physics, and basic energy sciences research.",

The standard approach is a pertubative subtraction. In this work, we demonstrate the abilities of our new noise subtraction methods with methods which show considerable improvement over pertubative subtraction in the reduction of the variance for the set of LQCD operators that were studied. The methods were tested at $κ_{crit}$ on quenched configurations, as well as on dynamical quark configurations at $κ= 0.1453$. A significant improvement in the reduction of operator variance was observed in both cases.",

      "summary": "Lattice QCD solvers encounter critical slowing down for fine lattice spacings and small quark mass. Traditional matrix eigenvalue deflation is one approach to mitigating this problem. However, to improve scaling we study the effects of deflating on the coarse grid in a hierarchy of three grids for adaptive mutigrid applications of the two dimensional Schwinger model. We compare deflation at the fine and coarse levels with other non deflated methods. We find the inclusion of a partial solve on the intermediate grid allows for a low tolerance deflated solve on the coarse grid. We find very good scaling in lattice size near critical mass when we deflate at the coarse level using the GMRES-DR and GMRES-Proj algorithms.",

Gradient flow (when modified by a field rescaling) can be characterized as a continuous blocking transformation. In this work, we draw a connection between gradient flow and functional renormalization group by describing how FRG can be represented by a stochastic process, and how the stochastic observables relate to gradient flow observables. The relation implies correlator scaling formulae that can be applied numerically in lattice simulations. We present preliminary results on anomalous dimensions obtained from such measurements in the context of 3-dimensional lattice $φ^4$ theory.",

Baryons and the effect of parity doubling in this temperature range have been analyzed previously by various other groups employing different setups. Here we construct suitable operators to investigate chiral and axial $U(1)_A$ symmetries in the baryon spectrum. Measurements for different volumes and quark-masses are done with two flavors of chirally symmetric domain-wall fermions at temperatures above the critical one. The possibility of emergent $SU(4)$ and $SU(2)_{CS}$ symmetries is discussed.",

For this initial study, we present a calculation of the nucleon mass, obtaining $964\\pm16$ MeV with all sources of statistical and systematic errors controlled and accounted for. This result is the most precise determination to date of the nucleon mass from first principles. We use the highly-improved staggered quark action, which is computationally efficient. Three gluon ensembles are employed, which have approximate lattice spacings $a=0.09$ fm, $0.12$ fm, and $0.15$ fm, each with equal-mass $u$/$d$, $s$, and $c$ quarks in the sea. Further, all ensembles have the light valence and sea $u$/$d$ quarks tuned to reproduce the physical pion mass, avoiding complications from chiral extrapolations or nonunitarity. Our work opens a new avenue for precise calculations of baryon properties, which are both feasible and relevant to experiments in particle and nuclear physics.",

      "summary": "The gradient flow transformation can be interpreted as continuous real-space renormalization group transformation if a coarse-graining step is incorporated as part of calculating expectation values. The method allows to predict critical properties of strongly coupled systems including the renormalization group $β$ function and anomalous dimensions at nonperturbative fixed points. In this contribution we discuss a new analysis of the continuous renormalization group $β$ function for $N_f=2$ and $N_f=12$ fundamental flavors in SU(3) gauge theories based on this method. We follow the approach developed and tested for the $N_f=2$ system in arXiv:1910.06408. Here we present further information on the analysis, emphasizing the robustness and intuitive features of the continuous $β$ function calculation. We also discuss the applicability of the continuous $β$ function calculation in conformal systems, extending the possible phase diagram to include a 4-fermion interaction. The numerical analysis for $N_f=12$ uses the same set of ensembles that was generated and analyzed for the step scaling function in arXiv:1909.05842. The new analysis uses volumes with $L \\ge 20$ and determines the $β$ function in the $c=0$ gradient flow renormalization scheme. The continuous $β$ function predicts the existence of a conformal fixed point and is consistent between different operators. Although determinations of the step scaling and continuous $β$ function use different renormalization schemes, they both predict the existence of a conformal fixed point around $g^2\\sim 6$.",

This technique is applied to quantum simulation of few-body disordered systems in the large volume limit; in particular, Anderson localization. The method requires a number of (error corrected) qubits proportional to the logarithm of the volume of the system, and each time evolution step requires a number of gates polylogarithmic in the volume. We simulate the method to observe the metal-insulator transition on a three-dimensional lattice. Additionally, we demonstrate the algorithm on a one-dimensional lattice, using physical quantum processors.",

The ensembles both employ $N_\\mathrm{f} = 2+1$ Wilson clover fermions. We determine the $Δ(1232)$ resonance parameters from a finite volume scattering analysis. In one study the single partial wave simplification is employed to compute the $p$-wave amplitude while in the other we treat the partial wave mixing between $s$- and $p$-wave contributions. Fitting our data to a Breit-Wigner resonance model we find $m_Δ/m_π= 7.13(9)$ and $4.75(5)$ on the two ensembles respectively, showing that for a lighter quark mass the resonance mass moves from near the $Nπ$ threshold to near the $Nππ$ threshold, in agreement with experiment.",

      "summary": "In quenched QCD the Polyakov loop is an order parameter of the deconfinement transition, but with decreasing quark mass, the peak in the Polyakov loop susceptibility becomes less pronounced, and it loses its interpretation as an indicator for deconfinement. For this $N_f=2+1$ HISQ study, we fix the strange quark mass $m_s$ at its physical value and investigate the dependence of the Polyakov loop on the light quark mass $m_l$ in the range $m_s/m_l=27-160$, following $m_l$ toward the chiral limit. In particular we will look how the inflection point and susceptibility behave as we decrease $m_l$, to see whether one finds any indication of a crossover, and therefore whether the Polyakov loop is sensitive to the chiral phase transition. Preliminary results show no signal of a crossover from the real part of the Polyakov loop in the vicinity of the chiral crossover. Closely related is an investigation of Polyakov loop correlations and the Debye mass in this limit. Preliminary results suggest little or no dependence on $m_l$.",

The cross sections are determined by the linear response of the nucleus to the weak interactions of the neutrino, and are dominated by energy and distance scales of the order of the separation between nucleons in the nucleus. These response functions are potentially an important early physics application of quantum computers. Here we present an analysis of the resources required and their expected scaling for scattering cross section calculations. We also examine simple small-scale neutrino-nucleus models on modern quantum hardware. In this paper, we use variational methods to obtain the ground state of a three nucleon system (the triton) and then implement the relevant time evolution. In order to tame the errors in present-day NISQ devices, we explore the use of different error-mitigation techniques to increase the fidelity of the calculations.",

      "title": "Long-range electroweak amplitudes of single hadrons from Euclidean finite-volume correlation functions",
      "summary": "A relation is presented between single-hadron long-range matrix elements defined in a finite Euclidean spacetime, and the corresponding infinite-volume Minkowski amplitudes. This relation is valid in the kinematic region where any number of two-hadron states can simultaneously go on shell, so that the effects of strongly-coupled intermediate channels are included. These channels can consist of non-identical particles with arbitrary intrinsic spins. The result accommodates general Lorentz structures as well as non-zero momentum transfer for the two external currents inserted between the single-hadron states. The formalism, therefore, generalizes the work by Christ et al.~[Phys.Rev. D91 114510 (2015)], and extends the reach of lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) to a wide class of new observables beyond meson mixing and rare decays. Applications include Compton scattering of the pion ($πγ^\\star \\to [ππ, K \\overline K] \\to πγ^\\star$), kaon ($K γ^\\star \\to [πK, ηK] \\to K γ^\\star$) and nucleon ($N γ^\\star \\to N π\\to N γ^\\star$), as well as double-$β$ decays, and radiative corrections to the single-$β$ decay, of QCD-stable hadrons. The framework presented will further facilitate generalization of the result to studies of nuclear amplitudes involving two currents from lattice QCD.",

These ensembles were generated with Iwasaki $\\times$ dislocation-suppressing-determinant-ratio gauge action at inverse lattice spacing of 1.378(7) GeV and pion mass values of 249.4(3) and 172.3(3) MeV. The nucleon mass extrapolates to a value $m_N = 0.950(5)$ GeV at physical point. The isovector vector charge renormalizes to unity in the chiral limit, narrowly constraining excited-state contamination in the calculation. The ratio of the isovector axial-vector to vector charges shows a deficit of about ten percent. The tensor coupling no longer depends on mass and extrapolates to 1.04(5) in $\\overline {\\rm MS}$ 2-GeV renormalization at physical point, in a good agreement with the value obtained at the lightest mass in our previous calculations and other calculations that followed. The scalar charge, though noisier, does not show mass dependence and is in agreement with other calculations.",

      "title": "Roper State from Overlap Fermions",
      "summary": "The Roper state is extracted with valence overlap fermions on a $2+1$-flavor domain-wall fermion lattice (spacing $a = 0.114$ fm and $m_π = 330$ MeV) using both the Sequential Empirical Bayes (SEB) method and the variational method. The results are consistent, provided that a large smearing-size interpolation operator is included in the variational calculation to have better overlap with the lowest radial excitation. Similar calculations carried out for an anisotropic clover lattice with similar parameters find the Roper $\\approx 280$ MeV higher than that of the overlap fermion. The fact that the prediction of the Roper state by overlap fermions is consistently lower than those of clover fermions, chirally improved fermions, and twisted-mass fermions over a wide range of pion masses has been dubbed a \"Roper puzzle.\"\n  To understand the origin of this difference, we study the hairpin $Z$-diagram in the isovector scalar meson ($a_0$) correlator in the quenched approximation. Comparing the $a_0$ correlators for clover and overlap fermions, at a pion mass of 290 MeV, we find that the spectral weight of the ghost state with clover fermions is smaller than that of the overlap at $a = 0.12$ fm and $0.09$ fm, whereas the whole $a_0$ correlators of clover and overlap at $a = 0.06$ fm coincide within errors. This suggests that chiral symmetry is restored for clover at $a \\le 0.06$ fm and that the Roper should come down at and below this $a$.\n  We conclude that this work supports a resolution of the \"Roper puzzle\" due to $Z$-graph type chiral dynamics. This entails coupling to higher components in the Fock space (e.g. $Nπ$, $Nππ$ states) to induce the effective flavor-spin interaction between quarks as prescribed in the chiral quark model, resulting in the parity-reversal pattern as observed in the experimental excited states of $N, Δ$ and $Λ$.",

For charmonium, an unexpected $X(3872)$ state appears at the open charm threshold. In heavy-light systems, analogous threshold effects appear for the lowest $J^P = 0^+$ and $1^+$ states in the $D_s$ and $B_s$ systems. Here we describe how lattice QCD can be used to understand these threshold dynamics by smoothly varying the strange-quark mass when studying the heavy-light systems. Small perturbations around the physical strange quark mass are used so to always remain near the physical QCD dynamics. This calculation is a straightforward extension of those already in the literature and can be undertaken by multiple lattice QCD collaborations with minimal computational cost.",

Here, the renormalization factors for the isovector operators, including all mixings between operators with different Dirac structures, are computed nonperturbatively in the regularization-independent momentum subtraction scheme for the first time. This study is undertaken in quenched QCD with three different lattice spacings. With Wilson flow applied to the gauge fields in the calculations, the operator mixing pattern due to chiral symmetry breaking with the lattice regularization is found to be significantly different from that predicted by one-loop lattice perturbation theory calculations.

They can be calculated in thermal equilibrium using lattice simulations, and be connected to moments of event-by-event net-particle multiplicity distributions. We calculate them from continuum extrapolated lattice simulations at $μ_B=0$, and present a finite-$μ_B$ extrapolation, comparing two different methods. In order to relate the grand canonical observables to the experimentally available net-particle fluctuations and correlations, we perform a Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model analysis, which allows us to completely break down the contributions from different hadrons. We then construct suitable hadronic proxies for fluctuations ratios, and study their behavior at finite chemical potentials. We also study the effect of introducing acceptance cuts, and argue that the small dependence of certain ratios on the latter allows for a direct comparison with lattice QCD results, provided that the same cuts are applied to all hadronic species. Finally, we perform a comparison for the constructed quantities for experimentally available measurements from the STAR Collaboration. Thus, we estimate the chemical freeze-out temperature to 165 MeV using a strangeness-related proxy. This is a rather high temperature for the use of the Hadron Resonance Gas, thus, further lattice studies are necessary to provide first principle results at intermediate $μ_B$.",

      "summary": "The Hadronic Vacuum Polarization (HVP) is a dominant contribution to the theoretical uncertainty of the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The uncertainty in a lattice QCD calculation of the connected light-quark contribution to the HVP is dominated by the long-distance region of the vector correlation function. Explicit studies of the exclusive channels of the HVP diagram make it possible to reconstruct the long-distance behavior of the correlation function. This removes most of the statistical uncertainty of the correlation function. In these proceedings, preliminary results of an exclusive study of the isospin symmetric connected-only vector-vector correlation function using a hybrid of distillation and A2A techniques are presented. The computation is performed on 2+1 flavor Möbius Domain Wall Fermion ensembles with physical pion mass. Reconstruction of the long-distance correlation function will enable lattice-only calculations of the HVP to achieve precision similar to estimates of the HVP from the R-ratio method on the timescale of the new experimental measurements of the muon anomalous magnetic moment.",

      "title": "Applying Complex Langevin to Lattice QCD at finite $μ$",
      "summary": "We continue our simulations of lattice QCD at finite quark-number chemical potential, $μ$, using the complex-Langevin equation (CLE) with gauge-cooling and adaptive updating. The CLE is used because QCD at finite finite $μ$ has a complex fermion determinant, which prevents use of standard simulation methods. Simulations using the standard lattice action show a transition from hadronic to nuclear matter for $μ< m_π/2$ rather than the expected $μ\\approx m_N/3$. This suggests that the CLE is being influenced by the phase-quenched theory, which has a transition at $μ= m_π/2$. We are therefore performing CLE simulations with a new action which includes an irrelevant chiral 4-fermion interaction. This separates the physics at energies of order of the pion mass and smaller from that at energies of the other hadrons. In doing this, it breaks the extended symmetry of the phase-quenched theory over that of the full theory, raising the masses of the extra pion-like excitations consisting of a quark and a conjugate quark, which could otherwise produce such an anomalous transition. Our preliminary CLE simulations using massless quarks, so that $m_π=0$, show no transition at $μ=m_π/2=0$, but do show a transition at an appreciably higher value of $μ$. It remains to be seen if this transition is near to $m_N/3$.",

      "summary": "The rare kaon decay $K^+\\toπ^+ν\\barν$ is an ideal process in which to search for signs of new physics and is the primary goal of the NA62 experiment at CERN. In this paper we report on a lattice QCD calculation of the long-distance contribution to the $K^+\\toπ^+ν\\barν$ decay amplitude at the near-physical pion mass $m_π=170$ MeV. The calculations are however, performed on a coarse lattice and hence with a lighter charm quark mass ($m_c^{\\bar{\\mathrm{MS}}}(\\mbox{3 GeV})=750$ MeV) than the physical one. The main aims of this study are two-fold. Firstly we study the momentum dependence of the amplitude and conclude that it is very mild so that a computation at physical masses even at a single kinematic point would provide a good estimate of the long-distance contribution to the decay rate. Secondly we compute the contribution to the branching ratio from the two-pion intermediate state whose energy is below the kaon mass and find that it is less than 1% after its exponentially growing unphysical contribution has been removed and that the corresponding non-exponential finite-volume effects are negligibly small.",

      "summary": "The internal structures of $J^{PC}=1^{--}, (0,1,2)^{-+}$ charmonium-like hybrids are investigated under lattice QCD in the quenched approximation. We define the Bethe-Salpeter wave function $Φ_n(r)$ in the Coulomb gauge as the matrix element of a spatially extended hybrid-like operator $\\bar{c}{c}g$ between the vacuum and $n$-th state for each $J^{PC}$ with $r$ being the spatial separation between a localized $\\bar{c}c$ component and the chromomagnetic strength tensor. These wave functions exhibit some similarities for states with the aforementioned different quantum numbers, and their $r$-behaviors (no node for the ground states and one node for the first excited states) imply that $r$ can be a meaningful dynamical variable for these states. Additionally, the mass splittings of the ground states and first excited states of charmonium-like hybrids in these channels are obtained for the first time to be approximately 1.2-1.4 GeV. These results do not support the flux-tube description of heavy-quarkonium-like hybrids in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. In contrast, a charmonium-like hybrid can be viewed as a \"color halo\" charmonium for which a relatively localized color octet $\\bar{c}c$ is surrounded by gluonic degrees of freedom, which can readily decay into a charmonium state along with one or more light hadrons. The color halo picture is compatible with the decay properties of $Y(4260)$ and suggests LHCb and BelleII to search for $(0,1,2)^{-+}$ charmonium-like hybrids in $χ_{c0,1,2}η$ and $J/ψω(φ)$ final states.",

      "summary": "Quantum computers open the possibility of performing real-time calculations for quantum field theory scattering processes. We propose to use an index averaging the absolute value of the difference between the accurately calculated Trotter evolution of site occupations and their actual measurements on NISQ machines. The average is over all the qubits for a certain number of Trotter steps. We use this metric to quantify the progress made in successive state-of-the-art machines and error-mitigation techniques. We illustrate the concept with the transverse Ising model in one spatial dimension with four sites using three of IBM's quantum computers (Almaden, Boeblingen, and Melbourne). We discuss the size of the Trotter steps needed to achieve physics goals. Using the proposed metric, we show that readout mitigation methods and Richardson extrapolations of mitigated measurements are very effective for specific numbers of Trotter steps of a chosen size. This specific choice can be applied to other machines and noise mitigation methods. On the other hand, a reliable algorithmic mitigation would require a significantly larger number of smaller Trotter steps.",

Here we provide the one-loop renormalization of these operators in a regularization-independent momentum subtraction (RI$^\\prime$/MOM) scheme, as well as the conversion factor from the RI$^\\prime$/MOM-renormalized quasi-TMDPDF to the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme.

Often, these extensions allow N = 3 as a plausible choice, or even require N = 3, such as in twin Higgs models, where the new dynamics is a \"copy\" of QCD. However, the fermion masses in such a sector are typically different from (often heavier than) the ones of real-world QCD, relative to the confinement scale. Many of the strong interaction masses and matrix elements for SU(3) at heavy fermion masses have already been computed on the lattice, typically as a byproduct of the approach to the physical point of real QCD.

Examples include direct dark matter detection, neutrinoless double beta decay, and searches for permanent electric dipole moments of the neutron and atoms. It will also help connect QCD to the properties of cold neutron stars and hot supernova cores. We discuss how a quantitative bridge between QCD and the properties of nuclei and nuclear matter will require a synthesis of lattice QCD (especially as applied to two- and three-nucleon interactions), effective field theory, and ab initio methods for solving the nuclear many-body problem. While there are significant challenges that must be addressed in developing this triad of theoretical tools, the rapid advance of computing is accelerating progress. In particular, we focus this review on the anticipated advances from lattice QCD and how these advances will impact few-body effective theories of nuclear physics by providing critical input, such as constraints on unknown low-energy constants of the effective (field) theories. We also review particular challenges that must be overcome for the successful application of lattice QCD for low-energy nuclear physics. We describe progress in developing few-body effective (field) theories of nuclear physics, with an emphasis on HOBET, a non-relativistic effective theory of nuclear physics, which is less common in the literature. We use the examples of neutrinoless double beta decay and the nuclear-matter equation of state to illustrate how the coupling of lattice QCD to effective theory might impact our understanding of symmetries and exotic astrophysical environments.",

      "summary": "We present a real-space renormalization group transformation with continuous scale change to calculate the continuous renormalization group $β$ function in non-perturbative lattice simulations. Our method is motivated by the connection between Wilsonian renormalization group and the gradient flow transformation. It does not rely on the perturbative definition of the renormalized coupling and is also valid at non-perturbative fixed points. Although our method requires an additional extrapolation compared to traditional step scaling calculations, it has several advantages which compensates for this extra step even when applied in the vicinity of the perturbative fixed point. We illustrate our approach by calculating the $β$ function of 2-flavor QCD and show that lattice predictions from individual lattice ensembles, even without the required continuum and finite volume extrapolations, can be very close to the result of the full analysis. Thus our method provides a non-perturbative framework and intuitive understanding into the structure of strongly coupled systems, in addition to being complementary to existing lattice determinations.",

Computations use MILC ensembles of gauge field configuations with $2+1+1$ flavors of sea quarks with the HISQ discretization, including lattices with physically light up/down quark masses. We discuss features unique to calculating matrix elements of these operators and analyze uncertainties from series truncation, discretization, and quark mass dependence. Finally we report the first Standard Model determination of $ΔΓ_s$ using lattice QCD results for all hadronic matrix elements through $\\mathcal{O}(1/m_b)$. The main result of our calculations yields the $1/m_b$ contribution $ΔΓ_{1/m_b} = -0.022(10)~\\mathrm{ps}^{-1}$.

If such decay would exist in nature, then $π^-π^-\\to ee$ and $π^-\\toπ^+ ee$ (or equivalently $π^-e^+\\toπ^+ e^-$) are the two simplest processes accessible via first-principle lattice QCD calculations. In this work, we calculate the long-distance contributions to the $π^-\\toπ^+ee$ transition amplitude using four ensembles at the physical pion mass with various volumes and lattice spacings. We adopt the infinite-volume reconstruction method to control the finite-volume effects arising from the (almost) massless neutrino. Providing the lattice QCD inputs for chiral perturbation theory, we obtain the low energy constant $g_ν^{ππ}(m_ρ)=-10.89(28)_\\text{stat}(74)_\\text{sys}$, which is close to $g_ν^{ππ}(m_ρ)=-11.96(31)_\\text{stat}$ determined from the crossed-channel $π^-π^-\\to ee$ decay.",

      "summary": "Computing the trace of the inverse of large matrices is typically addressed through statistical methods. Deflating out the lowest eigenvectors or singular vectors of the matrix reduces the variance of the trace estimator. This work summarizes our efforts to reduce the computational cost of computing the deflation space while achieving the desired variance reduction for Lattice QCD applications. Previous efforts computed the lower part of the singular spectrum of the Dirac operator by using an eigensolver preconditioned with a multigrid linear system solver. Despite the improvement in performance in those applications, as the problem size grows the runtime and storage demands of this approach will eventually dominate the stochastic estimation part of the computation.\n  In this work, we propose to compute the deflation space in one of the following two ways. First, by using an inexact eigensolver on the Hermitian, but maximally indefinite, operator $A γ_5$. Second, by exploiting the fact that the multigrid prolongator for this operator is rich in components toward the lower part of the singular spectrum. We show experimentally that the inexact eigensolver can approximate the lower part of the spectrum even for ill-conditioned operators. Also, the deflation based on the multigrid prolongator is more efficient to compute and apply, and, despite its limited ability to approximate the fine level spectrum, it obtains similar variance reduction on the trace estimator as deflating with approximate eigenvectors from the fine level operator.",

      "title": "Machine-Learning Prediction for Quasi-PDF Matrix Elements",
      "summary": "There have been rapid developments in the direct calculation in lattice QCD (LQCD) of the Bjorken-$x$ dependence of hadron structure through large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). LaMET overcomes the previous limitation of LQCD to moments (that is, integrals over Bjorken-$x$) of hadron structure, allowing LQCD to directly provide the kinematic regions where the experimental values are least known. LaMET requires large-momentum hadron states to minimize its systematics and allow us to reach small-$x$ reliably. This means that very fine lattice spacing to minimize lattice artifacts at order $(P_z a)^n$ will become crucial for next-generation LaMET-like structure calculations. Furthermore, such calculations require operators with long Wilson-link displacements (in finer lattice units), increasing the communication costs relative to that of the propagator inversion. In this work, we explore whether machine-learning (ML) algorithms can make correlator predictions to reduce the computational cost of these LQCD calculations. We consider two algorithms, gradient-boosting decision tree and linear models, applied to LaMET data, the matrix elements needed to determine the kaon and $η_s$ unpolarized parton distribution functions (PDFs), meson distribution amplitude (DA), and the nucleon gluon PDF. We find that both algorithms can reliably predict the target observables with different fit quality and systematic errors. The predictions from smaller displacement $z$ to larger ones work better than those for momentum $p$ due to the higher correlation among the data.",

The analysis yields predictions for the relevant form factors, within quantifiable bounds. These form factors are used to compute the semileptonic ratios $R(H_c)$ and various decay-product polarizations. In particular, we find $R(D_s^*)=0.20(3)$ and $R(J/ψ)=0.25(3)$, predictions that can be compared to results of upcoming LHCb measurements.

      "title": "Consistency checks for two-body finite-volume matrix elements: I. Conserved currents and bound states",
      "summary": "Recently, a framework has been developed to study form factors of two-hadron states probed by an external current. The method is based on relating finite-volume matrix elements, computed using numerical lattice QCD, to the corresponding infinite-volume observables. As the formalism is complicated, it is important to provide non-trivial checks on the final results and also to explore limiting cases in which more straightforward predications may be extracted. In this work we provide examples on both fronts. First, we show that, in the case of a conserved vector current, the formalism ensures that the finite-volume matrix element of the conserved charge is volume-independent and equal to the total charge of the two-particle state. Second, we study the implications for a two-particle bound state. We demonstrate that the infinite-volume limit reproduces the expected matrix element and derive the leading finite-volume corrections to this result for a scalar current. Finally, we provide numerical estimates for the expected size of volume effects in future lattice QCD calculations of the deuteron's scalar charge. We find that these effects completely dominate the infinite-volume result for realistic lattice volumes and that applying the present formalism, to analytically remove an infinite-series of leading volume corrections, is crucial to reliably extract the infinite-volume charge of the state.",

We incorporate several combinations of smeared-point and smeared-smeared pion source-sink interpolation fields in obtaining the lattice QCD matrix elements using the summation method. After one-loop perturbative matching and combining the pseudo-distributions from these two ensembles, we extract the pion valence quark distribution using a phenomenological functional form motivated by the global fits of parton distribution functions. We also calculate the lowest four moments of the pion quark distribution through the \"OPE without OPE\". We present a qualitative comparison between our lattice QCD extraction of the pion valence quark distribution with that obtained from global fits and previous lattice QCD calculations.",

The gauge coupling of this system runs very slowly, which is reflected in a small step scaling function, making numerical simulations particularly challenging. We present a detailed analysis including the study of systematic effects of our extensive data set generated with twelve dynamical flavors using the Symanzik gauge action and three times stout smeared Möbius domain wall fermions. Using up to $32^4$ volumes, we calculate renormalized couplings for different gradient flow schemes and determine the step-scaling $β$ function for a scale change $s=2$ on up to five different lattice volume pairs. Our preferred analysis is fully $O(a^2)$ Symanzik improved and uses Zeuthen flow combined with the Symanzik operator. We find an infrared fixed point within the range $5.2 \\le g_c^2 \\le 6.4$ in the $c=0.250$ finite volume gradient flow scheme. We account for systematic effects by calculating the step-scaling function based on alternative flows (Wilson or Symanzik) as well as operators (Wilson plaquette, clover) and also explore the effects of the perturbative tree-level improvement.",

Universal properties of this second-order phase transition can be mapped to QCD temperature T and μ_B using non-universal parameters determined by lattice QCD recently. Motivated by these results, first, we discuss the analytic structure of the partition function in the QCD crossover regime - the so-called Yang-Lee edge singularity - solely based on universal properties. Next, utilizing the lattice QCD results for non-universal parameters we map this singularity to the real T and complex μ_B plane, leading to the determination of the radius of convergence is in μ_B in the QCD crossover regime. These universality- and QCD-based results provide tight constraints on the range of validity of the lattice QCD calculations at μ_B. Implication of this result on the location of the conjectured QCD critical point is discussed.",

So far, no consensus about the order of the deconfinement transition in this theory has been reached and this hinders progress in understanding the nature of the black hole/black string topology change from the gauge/gravity duality perspective. On the one hand, previous works considered the deconfinement transition consistent with two transitions which are of second and third order. On the other hand, evidence for a first order transition was put forward more recently. We perform high-statistics lattice Monte Carlo simulations at large $N$ and small lattice spacing to establish that the transition is really of first order. Our findings flag a warning that the required large-$N$ and continuum limit might not have been reached in earlier publications, and that was the source of the discrepancy. Moreover, our detailed results confirm the existence of a new partially deconfined phase which describes non-uniform black strings via the gauge/gravity duality. This phase exhibits universal features already predicted in quantum field theory.",

      "summary": "We analyze the spectrum of two- and three-pion states of maximal isospin obtained recently for isosymmetric QCD with pion mass $M\\approx 200\\;$MeV in Ref. [1]. Using the relativistic three-particle quantization condition, we find $\\sim 2 σ$ evidence for a nonzero value for the contact part of the three-$π^+$ ($I=3$) scattering amplitude. We also compare our results to leading-order chiral perturbation theory. We find good agreement at threshold, and some tension in the energy dependent part of the three-$π^+$scattering amplitude. We also find that the two-$π^+$ ($I=2$) spectrum is fit well by an $s$-wave phase shift that incorporates the expected Adler zero.",

Our gauge ensembles are generated with Möbius domain-wall fermions, but the measurements such as susceptibilities are reweighted to those for the overlap fermions by using overlap/domain-wall reweighting technique. We find that the $U(1)_A$ and topological susceptibilities are strongly suppressed in the small quark mass region, which is related to the reduction of chiral-zero and low-nonzero modes on the Dirac spectra. We also examine their volume dependence.",

We detail algorithms for computing parton distribution functions and the hadronic tensor in the Thirring model. Their generalization to QCD is discussed, with the conclusion that the parton distribution function is best obtained by fitting the hadronic tensor, rather than direct calculation. As a side effect of this method, we find that lepton-hadron cross sections may be computed relatively cheaply. Finally, we estimate the computational cost of performing such a calculation on a digital quantum computer, including the cost of state preparation, for physically relevant parameters.",

Continuum-extrapolated results were obtained using calculations with a variety of lattice spacings corresponding to temporal lattice extents $N_τ= 6 - 16$.

This technique is expected to be critical for the precision measurement of $K\\rightarrow(ππ)_{I=0}$ matrix elements where physical kinematics demands moving pions in the final state and the statistical noise caused by disconnected contributions will make it difficult to use multi-exponential fits to isolate this as an excited state. We present a formalism for computing hadronic Green's functions with G-parity boundary conditions, derive the discretized action and its symmetries, discuss how the strange quark can be introduced and detail techniques for the numerical implementation of these boundary conditions. We demonstrate and test these methods using several $16^3\\times 32$ dynamical domain wall ensembles with a $420$ MeV pion mass and G-parity boundary conditions in one and two spatial directions.",

      "summary": "Modern advances in algorithms for lattice QCD calculations have steadily driven down the resources required to generate gauge field ensembles and calculate quark propagators, such that, in cases relevant to nuclear physics, performing quark contractions to assemble correlation functions from propagators has become the dominant cost. This work explores a propagator sparsening algorithm for forming correlation functions describing multi-hadron systems, such as light nuclei, with reduced computational cost. The algorithm constructs correlation functions from sparsened propagators defined on a coarsened lattice geometry, where the sparsened propagators are obtained from propagators computed on the full lattice. This algorithm is used to study the low-energy QCD ground-state spectrum using a single Wilson-clover lattice ensemble with $m_π \\approx 800$ MeV. It is found that the extracted ground state masses and binding energies, as well as their statistical uncertainties, are consistent when determined from correlation functions constructed from sparsened and full propagators. In addition, while evidence of modified couplings to excited states is observed in sparsened correlation functions, it is demonstrated that these effects can be removed, if desired, with an inexpensive modification to the sparsened estimator.",

For this, we compute the free energy to introduce the background gauge field of the $Q=1$ monopole-antimonopole pair in three-dimensional non-compact QED with $N=2,4$ and $12$ flavors of massless two-component fermions, and study its asymptotic logarithmic dependence on the monopole-antimonopole separation. We estimate the scaling dimension in the $N=12$ case to be consistent with the large-$N$ (free fermion) value. We find the deviations from this large-$N$ value for $N=2$ and $4$ are positive but small, implying that the higher order corrections in the large-$N$ expansion become mildly important for $N=2,4$.",

      "summary": "We investigate numerically the effect of regulating fermions in the presence of singular background fields in three dimensions. For this, we couple free lattice fermions to a background compact U(1) gauge field consisting of a monopole-anti-monopole pair of magnetic charge $\\pm Q$ separated by a distance $s$ in a periodic $L^3$ lattice, and study the low-lying eigenvalues of different lattice Dirac operators under a continuum limit defined by taking $L\\to\\infty$ at fixed $s/L$. As the background gauge field is parity even, we look for a two-fold degeneracy of the Dirac spectrum that is expected of a continuum-like Dirac operator. The naive-Dirac operator exhibits such a parity-doubling, but breaks the degeneracy of the fermion-doubler modes for the $Q$ lowest eigenvalues in the continuum limit. The Wilson-Dirac operator lifts the fermion-doublers but breaks the parity-doubling in the $Q$ lowest modes even in the continuum limit. The overlap-Dirac operator shows parity-doubling of all the modes even at finite $L$ that is devoid of fermion-doubling, and singles out as a properly regulated continuum Dirac operator in the presence of singular gauge field configurations albeit with a peculiar algorithmic issue.",

Such computations, however, are often faced with exponential signal-to-noise challenges that render key physics studies untenable even with next generation classical computing. Here, a method is presented by which the output of small-scale quantum computations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era hardware can be used to accelerate larger-scale classical field theory calculations through the construction of optimized interpolating operators. The method is implemented and studied in the context of the 1+1-dimensional Schwinger model, a simple field theory which shares key features with the standard model of nuclear and particle physics.",

      "summary": "Gauge field theories play a central role in modern physics and are at the heart of the Standard Model of elementary particles and interactions. Despite significant progress in applying classical computational techniques to simulate gauge theories, it has remained a challenging task to compute the real-time dynamics of systems described by gauge theories. An exciting possibility that has been explored in recent years is the use of highly-controlled quantum systems to simulate, in an analog fashion, properties of a target system whose dynamics are difficult to compute. Engineered atom-laser interactions in a linear crystal of trapped ions offer a wide range of possibilities for quantum simulations of complex physical systems. Here, we devise practical proposals for analog simulation of simple lattice gauge theories whose dynamics can be mapped onto spin-spin interactions in any dimension. These include 1+1D quantum electrodynamics, 2+1D Abelian Chern-Simons theory coupled to fermions, and 2+1D pure Z2 gauge theory. The scheme proposed, along with the optimization protocol applied, will have applications beyond the examples presented in this work, and will enable scalable analog quantum simulation of Heisenberg spin models in any number of dimensions and with arbitrary interaction strengths.",

      "summary": "In this work, we use an extension of the quantization condition, given in Ref. [1], to numerically explore the finite-volume spectrum of three relativistic particles, in the case that two-particle subsets are either resonant or bound. The original form of the relativistic three-particle quantization condition was derived under a technical assumption on the two-particle K matrix that required the absence of two-particle bound states or narrow two-particle resonances. Here we describe how this restriction can be lifted in a simple way using the freedom in the definition of the K-matrix-like quantity that enters the quantization condition. With this in hand, we extend previous numerical studies of the quantization condition to explore the finite-volume signature for a variety of two- and three-particle interactions. We determine the spectrum for parameters such that the system contains both dimers (two-particle bound states) and one or more trimers (in which all three particles are bound), and also for cases where the two-particle subchannel is resonant. We also show how the quantization condition provides a tool for determining infinite-volume dimer-particle scattering amplitudes for energies below the dimer breakup. We illustrate this for a series of examples, including one that parallels physical deuteron-nucleon scattering. All calculations presented here are restricted to the case of three identical scalar particles.",

      "summary": "We use a chiral model for pion interactions, in the inverse amplitude formalism, to perform a simultaneous analysis of lattice QCD results for pion-pion scattering in all three isospin channels. The input is the finite-volume two-pion spectrum computed using lattice QCD from six ensembles on lattices elongated in one of the spatial dimensions. A two-flavor dynamical lattice QCD action is used with two quark masses corresponding to a pion mass of 315 MeV and 224 MeV. The spectrum in the elastic region is subjected to a global fit which takes into account full correlations across isospin, pion mass and decay constant. The parameters from the fit are used to perform a chiral extrapolation to the physical point. The cross-channel fit results in a more precise determination of the parameters of the model when compared with single channel fits. We obtain $m_πa_0^{I=0}=0.2132(9)$, and $m_πa_0^{I=2}=0.0433(2)$ as well as $m_σ=443(3)-i221(6)$ MeV and $m_ρ=724(4)-i67(1)$ MeV. Several aspects of scale setting and consistency with previous analyses of lattice QCD results are discussed as well.",

      "summary": "It would be very useful to find a way of reducing excited-state effects in lattice QCD calculations of nucleon structure that has a low computational cost. We explore the use of hybrid interpolators, which contain a nontrivial gluonic excitation, in a variational basis together with the standard interpolator with tuned smearing width. Using the clover discretization of the field strength tensor, a calculation using a fixed linear combination of standard and hybrid interpolators can be done using the same number of quark propagators as a standard calculation, making this a cost-effective option. We find that such an interpolator, optimized by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem, reduces excited-state contributions in two-point correlators. However, the effect in three-point correlators, which are needed for computing nucleon matrix elements, is mixed: for some matrix elements such as the tensor charge, excited-state effects are suppressed, whereas for others such as the axial charge, they are enhanced. The results illustrate that the variational method is not guaranteed to reduce the net contribution from excited states except in its asymptotic regime, and suggest that it may be important to use a large basis of interpolators capable of isolating all of the relevant low-lying states.",

      "summary": "The possibility of the existence of mesons with two or more quark-antiquark pairs is investigated with a new application of the Thomas-Fermi (TF) statistical quark model. Quark color couplings are treated in a mean field manner similar to a previous application to baryons, and short and concise expressions for energies are derived. We find that, on average, quarks only interact with antiquarks in such systems. The TF differential equation is constructed and systems with heavy-light quark content are examined. Three types of mesonic systems are defined. In the case of charm quarks, multi-charmonium, multi-$Z$ meson and multi-$D$ meson family types are examined. System analogs for bottom quarks are also constructed. Quantitative trends for system energies of mesonic quark matter are extracted as a function of the number of quark pairs. We find indications from energy plots that multi-$Z$ type mesons (and their bottom quark analogs) are actually stable for a range of quark number pairs. At this initial stage we have not yet included explicit spin interaction couplings between quarks, but we can take one level of degeneracy into account in our two-inequivalent TF function construction.",

      "summary": "Understanding the origin and dynamics of hadron structure and in turn that of atomic nuclei is a central goal of nuclear physics. This challenge entails the questions of how does the roughly 1 GeV mass-scale that characterizes atomic nuclei appear; why does it have the observed value; and, enigmatically, why are the composite Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) abnormally light in comparison? In this perspective, we provide an analysis of the mass budget of the pion and proton in QCD; discuss the special role of the kaon, which lies near the boundary between dominance of strong and Higgs mass-generation mechanisms; and explain the need for a coherent effort in QCD phenomenology and continuum calculations, in exa-scale computing as provided by lattice QCD, and in experiments to make progress in understanding the origins of hadron masses and the distribution of that mass within them. We compare the unique capabilities foreseen at the electron-ion collider (EIC) with those at the hadron-electron ring accelerator (HERA), the only previous electron-proton collider; and describe five key experimental measurements, enabled by the EIC and aimed at delivering fundamental insights that will generate concrete answers to the questions of how mass and structure arise in the pion and kaon, the Standard Model's NG modes, whose surprisingly low mass is critical to the evolution of our Universe.",

      "summary": "The excess mass of the neutron over the proton arises from two sources within the Standard Model, electromagnetism and the splitting of the down and up quark masses. The Cottingham Formula provides a means of determining the QED corrections from the forward Compton Amplitude, but this is challenged by the need for a subtraction function and the mixing of the QED and QCD (electro-weak) effects. I review the present understanding of the Cottingham Formula, including a discussion on the development of the formula, its renormalization which induces the mixing of QED and QCD effects, and the necessary modeling of the subtraction function that must be done to arrive a numerical prediction. I summarize the Regge Model originally proposed by Gasser and Leutwyler and I also review the proposed model by Walker-Loud, Carlson and Miller, which is an interpolation function between the low and high $Q^2$ regimes, both of which are anchored by rigorous theoretical underpinnings, for which I argue a more reliable theoretical uncertainty estimate can be obtained.",

Using the lattice formulation, we calculate beyond the validity of the virial expansion, a commonly used technique in many-body physics. We find qualitative differences in the behavior of the structure factors at high fugacity compared to the predictions of the virial expansion. Due to the large scattering length of neutrons, we expect the unitary gas structure factors to approximate the structure factors of hot neutron gases, and we therefore expect our calculations to be useful in supernova simulations, where neutron gas structure factors are needed to compute in-medium neutrino-neutron scattering rates.",

The calculation is performed within the coupled-channel Lüscher's finite-size formalism. The study focuses on the channel with $I^G(J^{PC})=1^+(1^{+-})$ where the resonance-like structure $Z_c(3900)$ was discovered. We first identify the most relevant two channels of the problem and the lattice study is performed within the two-channel scattering model. Combined with a two-channel Ross-Shaw theory, scattering parameters are extracted from the energy levels by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem. Our results on the scattering length parameters suggest that, at the particular lattice parameters that we studied, the best fitted parameters do not correspond to a peak behavior in the elastic scattering cross section near the threshold. Furthermore, within the zero-range Ross-Shaw theory, the scenario of a narrow resonance close to the threshold is disfavored beyond $3σ$ level.",

      "summary": "We calculate the bag parameters for neutral $B$-meson mixing in and beyond the Standard Model, in full four-flavour lattice QCD for the first time. We work on gluon field configurations that include the effect of $u$, $d$, $s$ and $c$ sea quarks with the Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) action at three values of the lattice spacing and with three $u/d$ quark masses going down to the physical value. The valence $b$ quarks use the improved NRQCD action and the valence light quarks, the HISQ action. Our analysis was blinded. Our results for the bag parameters for all five operators are the most accurate to date. For the Standard Model operator between $B_s$ and $B_d$ mesons we find: $\\hat{B}_{B_s}=1.232(53)$, $\\hat{B}_{B_d}=1.222(61)$. Combining our results with lattice QCD calculations of the decay constants using HISQ quarks from the Fermilab/MILC collaboration and with experimental values for $B_s$ and $B_d$ oscillation frequencies allows determination of the CKM elements $V_{ts}$ and $V_{td}$. We find $V_{ts} = 0.04189(93)$, $V_{td} = 0.00867(23)$ and $V_{ts}/V_{td} = 0.2071(27)$. Our results agree well (within $2σ$) with values determined from CKM unitarity constraints based on tree-level processes (only). Using a ratio to $ΔM$ in which CKM elements cancel in the Standard Model, we determine the branching fractions ${\\text{Br}}(B_s\\rightarrow μ^+μ^-) = 3.81(18) \\times 10^{-9}$ and ${\\text{Br}}(B_d\\rightarrow μ^+μ^-) = 1.031(54) \\times 10^{-10}$. We also give results for matrix elements of the operators $R_0$, $R_1$ and $\\tilde{R}_1$ that contribute to neutral $B$-meson width differences.",

      "summary": "Simulations of gauge theories on quantum computers require the digitization of continuous field variables. Digitization schemes that uses the minimum amount of qubits are desirable. We present a practical scheme for digitizing $SU(3)$ gauge theories via its discrete subgroup $S(1080)$. The $S(1080)$ standard Wilson action cannot be used since a phase transition occurs as the coupling is decreased, well before the scaling regime. We proposed a modified action that allows simulations in the scaling window and carry out classical Monte Carlo calculations down to lattice spacings of order $a\\approx 0.08$ fm. We compute a set of observables with sub-percent precision at multiple lattice spacings and show that the continuum extrapolated value agrees with the full $SU(3)$ results. This suggests that this digitization scheme provides sufficient precision for NISQ-era QCD simulations.",

      "summary": "Results are presented for the nucleon isovector electromagnetic form factors using 11 ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration using the 2+1+1-flavors HISQ action. They span 4 lattice spacings $a \\sim$ 0.06, 0.09, 0.12 and 0.15~fm and 3 values of $M_π\\sim 135, 225$ and 315 MeV. High-statistics estimates are used to perform a simultaneous extrapolation in the lattice spacing, lattice volume and light-quark masses. The $Q^2$ dependence over the range 0.05-1.4 ${\\rm GeV}^2$ is investigated using both the $z$-expansion and the dipole form. Final $z$-expansion estimates for the isovector r.m.s. radius are $r_E = 0.769(27)(30)$ fm $r_M = 0.671(48)(76)$ fm and $μ^{p-n} = 3.939(86)(138)$ Bohr magneton. The first error is the combined uncertainty from the leading-order analysis, and the second is an estimate of the additional uncertainty due to using the leading order chiral-continuum-finite-volume fits. The dipole estimates, $r_E = 0.765(11)(8)$ fm, $r_M = 0.704(21)(29)$ fm and $μ^{p-n} = 3.975(84)(125)$, are consistent with those from the $z$-expansion but with smaller errors. Our analysis highlights three points. First, all data from the eleven ensembles and existing lattice data on, or close to, physical mass ensembles from other collaborations collapses more clearly onto a single curve when plotted versus $Q^2/M_N^2$ as compared to $Q^2$ with the scale set by quantities other than $M_N$. The difference between these two analyses is indicative of discretization errors, some of which presumably cancel when the data are plotted versus $Q^2/M_N^2$. Second, the size of the remaining deviation of this common curve from the Kelly curve is small and can be accounted for by statistical and possible systematic uncertainties. Third, to improve lattice estimates, high statistics data for $Q^2 < 0.1$ ${\\rm GeV}^2$ are needed.",

      "summary": "Using lattice simulations, we show that there is a phase of thermal QCD, where the spectral density $ρ(λ)$ of Dirac operator changes as $1/λ$ for the infrared eigenvalues $λ<T$. This behavior persists over the entire low energy band we can resolve accurately, over three orders of magnitude on our largest volumes. We propose that in this \"IR phase\", the well-known non-interacting scale invariance at very short distances (UV, $λ\\rightarrow \\infty$, asymptotic freedom), coexists with very different interacting type of scale invariance at long distances (IR, $λ<T$). Such dynamics may be responsible for the unusual fluidity properties of the medium observed at RHIC and LHC. We point out its connection to the physics of Banks-Zaks fixed point, leading to the possibility of massless glueballs in the fluid. Our results lead to the classification of thermal QCD phases in terms of IR scale invariance. The ensuing picture naturally subsumes the standard chiral crossover feature at $\"\\!T_c\\!\" \\,\\approx 155$ MeV. Its crucial new aspect is the existence of temperature $T_{IR}$ (200 MeV $< T_{IR} < $ 250 MeV) marking the onset of IR phase and possibly a true phase transition.",

      "summary": "We present the first calculation of the hadronic tensor on the lattice for the nucleon. The hadronic tensor can be used to extract the structure functions in deep inelastic scatterings and also provide information for the neutrino-nucleon scattering which is crucial to the neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments at low energies. The most challenging part in the calculation is to solve an inverse problem. We have implemented and tested three algorithms using mock data, showing that the Bayesian Reconstruction method has the best resolution in extracting peak structures while the Backus-Gilbert and Maximum Entropy methods are somewhat more stable for the flat spectral function. Numerical results are presented for both the elastic case (clover fermions on domain wall configuration with $m_π\\sim$ 370 MeV and $a\\sim$ 0.06 fm) and a case (anisotropic clover lattice with $m_π\\sim$ 380 MeV and $a_t\\sim$ 0.035 fm) with large momentum transfer. For the former case, the reconstructed Minkowski hadronic tensor gives precisely the vector charge which proves the feasibility of the approach. While for the latter case, the nucleon resonances and possibly shallow inelastic scattering contributions around $ν=1$ GeV are clearly observed but no information is obtained for higher excited states with $ν>2$ GeV. A check of the effective masses of $ρ$ meson with different lattice setups indicates that, in order to reach higher energy transfers, using lattices with smaller lattice spacings is essential.",

To demonstrate that this algorithm works well, we apply it to the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the Hubbard model away from half-filling on a two-dimensional lattice of small size, and show that the numerical results agree nicely with exact values.",

      "summary": "We aim to explore the production rate of the pseudoscalar glueball in $J/ψ$ radiative decay by lattice QCD in quenched approximation. The calculation is performed on three anisotropic lattices with the spatial lattice spacing ranging from 0.222(2) fm to 0.110(1) fm. As a calibration of some systematical uncertainties, we first extract the $M1$ form factor $\\hat{V}(0)$ of the process $J/ψ\\toγη_{c}$ and get the result $\\hat{V}(0)=1.933(41)$ in the continuum limit, which gives the partial width $Γ(J/ψ\\toγη_{c})=2.47(11)$ keV. These results are in agreement with that of previous lattice studies. As for the pseudoscalar glueball $G_{0^{-+}}$, its mass is derived to be $2.395(14)$ GeV, and the form factor $\\hat{V}(0)$ of the process $J/ψ\\toγG_{0^{-+}}$ is determined to be $\\hat{V}(0)=0.0246(43)$ after continuum extrapolation. Finally, the production rate of the pseudoscalar glueball is predicted to be $2.31(90)\\times10^{-4}$, which is much smaller than that of conventional light $q\\bar{q}$ $η$ states. After the subtraction of the phase space factor, the couplings of $J/ψXγ$ are similar where $X$ stands for $η$ states and the pseudoscalar glueball. Possibly, the $U_{A}(1)$ anomaly plays an important role for the large couplings of gluons to the flavor singlet $η$ states in $J/ψ$ radiative decays.",

      "summary": "We construct a qubit regularization of the $O(3)$ non-linear sigma model in two and three spatial dimensions using a quantum Hamiltonian with two qubits per lattice site. Using a worldline formulation and worm algorithms, we show that in two spatial dimensions our model has a quantum critical point where the well-known scale-invariant physics of the three-dimensional Wilson-Fisher fixed point is reproduced. In three spatial dimensions, we recover mean-field critical exponents at a similar quantum critical point. These results show that our qubit Hamiltonian is in the same universality class as the traditional classical lattice model close to the critical points. Simple modifications to our model also allow us to study the physics of traditional lattice models with $O(2)$ and $Z_2$ symmetries close to the corresponding critical points.",

      "summary": "We show how to formulate a lattice gauge theory whose naive continuum limit corresponds to two-dimensional (Euclidean) quantum gravity including a positive cosmological constant. More precisely the resultant continuum theory corresponds to gravity in a first-order formalism in which the local frame and spin connection are treated as independent fields. Recasting this lattice theory as a tensor network allows us to study the theory at strong coupling without encountering a sign problem. In two dimensions this tensor network is exactly soluble and we show that the system has a series of critical points that occur for pure imaginary coupling and are associated with first order phase transitions. We then augment the action with a Yang-Mills term which allows us to control the lattice spacing and show how to apply the TRG to compute the free energy and look for critical behavior. Finally we perform an analytic continuation in the gravity coupling in this extended model and show that its critical behavior in a certain scaling limit depends only on the topology of the underlying lattice. We also show how the lattice gauge theory can be naturally generalized to generate the Polyakov or Liouville action for two dimensional quantum gravity.",

      "summary": "The chiral phase transition temperature $T_{c}^{0}$ is a fundamental quantity of QCD. To determine this quantity we have performed simulations of (2 + 1)-flavor QCD using the Highly Improved Staggered Quarks (HISQ/tree) action on $N_τ=6, 8$ and 12 lattices with aspect ratios $N_σ/N_τ$ ranging from 4 to 8. In our simulations the strange quark mass is fixed to its physical value $m_{s}^{\\rm{phy}}$, and the values of two degenerate light quark masses $m_{l}$ are varied from $m_{s}^{\\rm{phy}}/20$ to $m_{s}^{\\rm{phy}}/160$ which correspond to a Goldstone pion mass $m_π$ ranging from 160 MeV to 55 MeV in the continuum limit. By investigating the light quark mass dependence and the volume dependence of various chiral observables, e.g. chiral susceptibilities and Binder cumulants, no evidence for a first order phase transition in our current quark mass window is found. Two estimators $T_{60}$ and $T_δ$ are proposed to extract the chiral phase transition temperature $T_{c}^{0}$ in the chiral and continuum limit and our current estimate for $T_{c}^{0}$ is $132_{-6}^{+3}$ MeV.",

The result arose in the context of a relation between finite-volume energies and $\\mathcal K_{\\text{df},3}$, derived to all orders in the perturbative expansion of a generic low-energy effective field theory. In this work we set aside the role of the finite volume and focus on the infinite-volume relation between $\\mathcal K_{\\text{df},3}$ and $\\mathcal M_3$. We show that, for any real choice of $\\mathcal K_{\\text{df},3}$, $\\mathcal M_3$ satisfies the three-particle unitarity constraint to all orders. Given that $\\mathcal K_{\\text{df},3}$ is also free of a class of kinematic divergences, the function may provide a useful tool for parametrizing three-body scattering data. Applications include the phenomenological analysis of experimental data (where the connection to the finite volume is irrelevant) as well as calculations in lattice quantum chromodynamics (where the volume plays a key role).",

      "title": "Axial Vector Form Factors from Lattice QCD that Satisfy the PCAC Relation",
      "summary": "Previous lattice QCD calculations of axial vector and pseudoscalar form factors show significant deviation from the partially conserved axial current (PCAC) relation between them. Since the original correlation functions satisfy PCAC, the observed deviations from the operator identity cast doubt on whether all the systematics in the extraction of form factors from the correlation functions are under control. We identify the problematic systematic as a missed excited state, whose energy as a function of the momentum transfer squared, $Q^2$, is determined from the analysis of the 3-point functions themselves. Its mass is much smaller than those of the excited states previously considered and including it impacts the extraction of all the ground state matrix elements. The form factors extracted using these mass/energy gaps satisfy PCAC and other consistency conditions, and validate the pion-pole dominance hypothesis. We also show that the extraction of the axial charge $g_A$ is very sensitive to the value of the mass gaps of the excited states used and current lattice data do not provide an unambiguous determination of these, unlike the $Q^2 \\neq 0$ case. To highlight the differences and improvement between the conventional versus the new analysis strategy, we present a comparison of results obtained on a physical pion mass ensemble at $a\\approx 0.0871\\,\\mathrm{fm}$. With the new strategy, we find $g_A = 1.30(6)$. A very significant improvement over previous lattice results is found for the axial charge radius $r_A = 0.74(6)\\,\\mathrm{fm}$, extracted using the $z$-expansion to parameterize the $Q^2$ behavior of $G_A(Q^2)$, and $g_P^\\ast = 8.06(44)$ obtained using the pion pole-dominance ansatz to fit the $Q^2$ behavior of the induced pseudoscalar form factor $\\widetilde{G}_P(Q^2)$.",

Our ansatz is based on a supervised learning framework in which prior knowledge is encoded in the training data and the inverse transformation manifold is explicitly parametrised through a neural network. We systematically investigate this novel reconstruction approach, providing a detailed analysis of its performance on physically motivated mock data, and compare it to established methods of Bayesian inference. The reconstruction accuracy is found to be at least comparable, and potentially superior in particular at larger noise levels. We argue that the use of labelled training data in a supervised setting and the freedom in defining an optimisation objective are inherent advantages of the present approach and may lead to significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in the future. Potential directions for further research are discussed in detail.",

A limitation of the method was the restriction to a single operator and a single momentum during the computation of each \"Feynman- Hellmann\" propagator. By using stochastic techniques to estimate the all-to-all propagator, we relax this constraint and demonstrate the successful implementation of this new method. We show reproduction of the axial charge on a test ensemble and non-zero momentum transfer points of the axial and vector form factors.",

The sea spin can be traced over to give a reduced density matrix, and it is shown that the resulting entanglement entropy acts as an order parameter of chiral symmetry breaking in the nucleon. In the large-$N_c$ limit, the entanglement entropy vanishes and the valence spin accounts for all of the nucleon spin, while in the limit of maximal entanglement entropy, the nucleon loses memory of the valence spin and consequently has spin dominated by the sea. The nucleon state vector in the chiral basis, fit to low-energy data, gives a valence spin content consistent with experiment and lattice QCD determinations, and has large entanglement entropy.",

Studies with unimproved actions found the existence of a critical quark mass value at which the crossover transition ends on a second order phase transition and becomes first order for smaller values of the quark mass for the case of both vanishing and imaginary chemical potential. We use the Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) action and perform calculations in the Roberge-Weiss (RW) plane, where the value of the critical mass is expected to be largest. The lowest quark mass value used in our simulation corresponds to the pion mass $m_π$, down to $40$ MeV. Contrary to calculations performed with unimproved actions we find no evidence for the occurrence of first order transitions at the smallest quark mass values explored so far. Moreover we also show that the chiral observables are sensitive to the RW transition. Our results also indicate that the RW transition and chiral transition could coincide in the chiral limit.",

The quark color charges are combined into either a set of three-quark nucleon states, or into a non-factorizable \"one big hadron\" state. In both cases we find that the energy per quark is roughly constant as the volume of quarks increases. A surprise is that if we construct the nucleon states from sets of three quarks chosen at random in the volume, then the energy per quark remains roughly constant, even as the average distance between quarks in a nucleon state grows as the volume increases. This energy dependence of a nucleon in a dense medium is at odds with the behavior of an isolated nucleon as quark separation increases, and for static quarks it is not easily explicable in terms of some version of Debye screening.",

      "summary": "It is suggested that a nearby $0^{++}$ resonance, $f_0$(1710) of mass $m_f=1723 MeV$ and width $Γ=139$ MeV is playing a significant role in efficiently providing the strong (CP-conserving) and weak (CP-odd) phase simultaneously in the recently observed direct CP asymmetry $ΔA_{CP}$ by the LHCb collaboration. The direct CP arises by the well known penguin-tree interference wherein the virtual b-quark in the c-u penguin is the source of the Kobayashi-Maskawa CP-odd phase, $γ$, in the SM. Loop (penguin) corrections generate left-right operators enhancing coupling to the $0^{++}$ scalar resonance. The scalar resonance is likely rich in gluonic content perhaps leading to a better understanding of large breaking of flavor SU(3) that has been known for a long-time. Approximate calculations give a rough understanding of the observed size of the CP asymmetry. The mechanism leads to several interesting implications which can be experimentally studied and tested. Moreover, in an analogous fashion to $f_0$, 4-quark operators also generate $P \\times P$, P being a pseudo-scalar bilinear, which may be dominated by the nearby $η(1760)$ of width about 250 MeV that can influence final states such as 4 $π$'s, $η^{\\prime}(η) + π^+ + π^-$ etc which could exhibit CP violating triple correlation or energy asymmetries. We also briefly discuss CP violation in radiative charm decays and suggest that simple final states $γρ$ and $γφ$ are best suited for sizeable asymmetries as well as providing precise tests of the SM.",

We focus on the zero-skewness limit, where the GPD has a probability-density interpretation in the longitudinal Bjorken $x$ and the transverse impact-parameter distributions. Our calculation is done using clover valence fermions on an ensemble of gauge configurations with $2+1+1$ flavors (degenerate up/down, strange and charm) of highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ) with lattice spacing $a \\approx 0.12$ fm, box size $L \\approx 3$ fm and pion mass $m_π\\approx 310$ MeV. The parton distribution function and the form factor are reproduced as special limits of the GPD as expected. Due to the large errors, this exploratory study does not show a clear preference among different model assumptions about the kinematic dependence of the GPD. To discriminate between these assumptions, future studies using higher-statistics data will be crucial.",

Training the model systematically improves autocorrelation times in the Markov chain, even in regions of parameter space where standard Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms exhibit critical slowing down in producing decorrelated updates.

      "summary": "Initializing a single site of a lattice scalar field theory into an arbitrary state with support throughout the quantum register requires ${\\cal O}(2^{n_Q})$ entangling gates on a quantum computer with $n_Q$ qubits per site. It is conceivable that, instead, initializing to functions that are good approximations to states may have utility in reducing the number of required entangling gates. In the case of a single site of a non-interacting scalar field theory, initializing to a symmetric exponential wavefunction requires $n_Q-1$ entangling gates, compared with the $2^{n_Q-1} + n_Q-3 + δ_{n_Q,1}$ required for a symmetric Gaussian wavefunction. In this work, we explore the initialization of 1-site ($n_Q=4$), 2-site ($n_Q=3$) and 3-site ($n_Q=3$) non-interacting scalar field theories with symmetric exponential wavefunctions using IBM's quantum simulators and quantum devices (Poughkeepsie and Tokyo). With the digitizations attainable with $n_Q = 3,4$, these tensor-product wavefunctions are found to have large overlap with a Gaussian wavefunction, and provide a suitable low-noise initialization for improvement and \\emph{Somma Inflation}. In performing these simulations, we have employed a workflow that interleaves calibrations to mitigate systematic errors in production. The calibrations allow tolerance cuts on gate performance including the fidelity of the symmetrizing Hadamard gate, both in vacuum ($|{\\bf 0}\\rangle^{\\otimes n_Q}$) and in medium ($n_Q-1$ qubits initialized to an exponential function). The results obtained in this work are relevant to systems beyond scalar field theories, such as the deuteron radial wavefunction, 2- and 3-dimensional cartesian-space wavefunctions, and non-relativistic multi-nucleon systems built on a localized eigenbasis.",

      "summary": "We present a modification of the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm for tackling the critical slowing down of generating Markov chains of lattice gauge configurations towards the continuum limit. We propose a new method to exchange information within an ensemble of Markov chains, and use it to construct an approximate inverse Hessian matrix of the action inspired from quasi-Newton algorithms for optimization. The kinetic term of the molecular dynamics evolution includes the approximate Hessian for long distance couplings among the momenta. We show the result of applying the new algorithm to the $U(1)$ gauge theory in two dimensions, and discuss our future plans.",

The simulations have been performed using two $N_f{=}2$ and $N_f{=}2{+}1{+}1$ ensembles. Both ensembles have a twisted mass action with a clover term with the quark masses fixed at their physical values (physical point) and volumes of $64^3{\\times}128$. The extracted quantities are compared with results from an existing $N_f{=}2$ ($48^3{\\times}96$) ensemble. This comparison allows one to address volume and quenching effects.",

Here, we discuss opportunities for Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD) in the research frontier in fundamental symmetries and signals for new physics. LQCD, in synergy with effective field theories and nuclear many-body studies, provides theoretical support to ongoing and planned experimental programs in searches for electric dipole moments of the nucleon, nuclei and atoms, decay of the proton, $n$-$\\overline{n}$ oscillations, neutrinoless double-$β$ decay of a nucleus, conversion of muon to electron, precision measurements of weak decays of the nucleon and of nuclei, precision isotope-shift spectroscopy, as well as direct dark matter detection experiments using nuclear targets. This whitepaper details the objectives of the LQCD program in the area of Fundamental Symmetries within the USQCD collaboration, identifies priorities that can be addressed within the next five years, and elaborates on the areas that will likely demand a high degree of innovation in both numerical and analytical frontiers of the LQCD research.",

      "summary": "We explore a $Z_2$ Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory in one spatial dimension with a coupling $h$, without imposing any Gauss' law constraint. We show that in our model $h=0$ is a free deconfined quantum critical point containing massless fermions where all Gauss' law sectors are equivalent. The coupling $h$ is a relevant perturbation of this critical point and fermions become massive due to confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. To study the emergent Gauss' law sectors at low temperatures in this massive phase we use a quantum Monte Carlo method that samples configurations of the partition function written in a basis in which local conserved charges are diagonal. We find that two Gauss' law sectors, related by particle-hole symmetry, emerge naturally. When the system is doped with an extra particle, many more Gauss's law sectors related by translation invariance emerge. Using results in the range $0.01 < h \\leq 0.15 $ we find that three different mass scales of the model behave like $h^{p}$ where $p \\approx 0.579$.",

Finite-volume spectra in three volumes are determined via a variational analysis of matrices of two-point correlation functions, computed using large bases of operators resembling single-meson, two-meson and three-meson structures, with the light-quark mass corresponding to a pion mass of $m_π\\approx 391$ MeV. Utilizing the relationship between the discrete spectrum of finite-volume energies and infinite-volume scattering amplitudes, we find a narrow axial-vector resonance ($J^{PC}=1^{+-}$), the analogue of the $b_1$ meson, with mass $m_{R}\\approx1380$ MeV and width $Γ_{R}\\approx 91$ MeV. The resonance is found to couple dominantly to $S$-wave $πω$, with a much-suppressed coupling to $D$-wave $πω$, and a negligible coupling to $πφ$ consistent with the `OZI rule'. No resonant behavior is observed in $πφ$, indicating the absence of a putative low-mass $Z_s$ analogue of the $Z_c$ claimed in $πJ/ψ$. In order to minimally present the contents of a unitary three-channel scattering matrix, we introduce an $n$-channel generalization of the traditional two-channel Stapp parameterization.",

      "summary": "We present a determination of the isospin-1/2 elastic $πK$ scattering amplitudes in S and P partial waves using lattice Quantum Chromodynamics. The amplitudes, constrained for a large number of real-valued energy points, are obtained as a function of light-quark mass, corresponding to four pion masses between 200 and 400 MeV. Below the first inelastic threshold, the P-wave scattering amplitude is dominated by a single pole singularity that evolves from being a stable bound-state at the highest quark mass into a narrow resonance that broadens as the pion and kaon masses are reduced. As in experiment, the S-wave amplitude does not exhibit an obviously resonant behavior, but instead shows a slow rise from threshold, which is not inconsistent with the presence of a $κ$/$K_0^\\star(700)$-like resonance at the considered quark masses. As has been found in analyses of experimental scattering data, simple analytic continuations into the complex energy plane of precisely-determined lattice QCD amplitudes on the real energy axis are not sufficient to model-independently determine the existence and properties of this state. The spectra and amplitudes we present will serve as an input for increasingly elaborate amplitude analysis techniques that implement more of the analytic structure expected at complex energies.",

We found no indication of a first order phase transition in the current window of quark masses and external magnetic fields.

At this time, there exit precise physical results only for the quark EDM operator by the PNDME collaboration. First results showing signal in the contributions of the $Θ$-term and the connected part of the chromo EDM operator have been presented. The challenge of divergent mixing in the chromo EDM and Weinberg operators has motivated calculations in the gradient flow scheme. While there has been steady progress, the challenges remaining are large. Results with $O(50\\%)$ uncertainty with control over all systematic errors can be expected for the $Θ$-term over the next five years. Prediction of a timeline for progress on the chromo EDM and the Weinberg operators will depend on when the renormalization and divergent mixing of these operators is brought under control. The most optimistic scenario is that the gradient flow scheme provides a solution to the numerical signal and mixing problems for both the gluonic and quark operators.",

      "summary": "Lattice QCD calculations of disconnected quark loop operators are extremely computer time-consuming to evaluate. To compute these diagrams using lattice techniques, one generally uses stochastic noise methods. These employ a randomly generated set of noise vectors to project out physical signals. In order to strengthen the signal in these calculations, various noise subtraction techniques may be employed. In addition to the standard method of perturbative subtraction, one may also employ matrix deflation techniques using the GMRES-DR and MINRES-DR algorithms as well as polynomial subtraction techniques to reduce statistical uncertainty. Our matrix deflation methods play two roles: they both speed up the solution of the linear equations as well as decrease numerical noise. We show how to combine deflation with either perturbative and polynomial methods to produce extremely powerful noise suppression algorithms. We use a variety of lattices to study the effects. In order to set a benchmark, we first use the Wilson matrix in the quenched approximation. We see strong low eigenmode dominance at kappa critical ($κ_{crit}$) in the variance of the vector and scalar operators. We also use MILC dynamic lattices, where we observe deflation subtraction results consistent with the effectiveness seen in the quenched data.",

Contrary to more naive discretizations of the sphere, in this construction the exact $O(3)$ symmetry is maintained, which suggests that the discretized model is in the same universality class as the continuum model. That would allow for continuum results to be obtained for very rough discretizations of the target space as long as the space discretization is made fine enough. The cost of performing time-evolution, measured as the number of CNOT operations necessary, is $12 L T/Δt $, where $L$ is the number of spatial sites, $T$ the maximum time extent and $Δt$ the time spacing.",

      "summary": "We report on lattice QCD calculations of the nucleon isovector axial, scalar, and tensor charges. Our calculations are performed on two 2+1-flavor ensembles generated using a 2-HEX-smeared Wilson-clover action at the physical pion mass and lattice spacings $a\\approx$ 0.116 and 0.093 fm. We use a wide range of source-sink separations - eight values ranging from roughly 0.4 to 1.4 fm on the coarse ensemble and three values from 0.9 to 1.5 fm on the fine ensemble - which allows us to perform an extensive study of excited-state effects using different analysis and fit strategies. To determine the renormalization factors, we use the nonperturbative Rome-Southampton approach and compare RI'-MOM and RI-SMOM intermediate schemes to estimate the systematic uncertainties. Our final results are computed in the MS-bar scheme at scale 2 GeV. The tensor and axial charges have uncertainties of roughly 4%, $g_T=0.972(41)$ and $g_A=1.265(49)$. The resulting scalar charge, $g_S=0.927(303)$, has a much larger uncertainty due to a stronger dependence on the choice of intermediate renormalization scheme and on the lattice spacing.",

We propose and calculate two novel estimators for the chiral transition temperature for several values of the light quark masses, corresponding to Goldstone pion masses in the range of $58~{\\rm MeV}\\lesssim m_π\\lesssim 163~{\\rm MeV}$. The chiral phase transition temperature is determined by extrapolating to vanishing pion mass using universal scaling analysis. Finite volume effects are controlled by extrapolating to the thermodynamic limit using spatial lattice extents in the range of $2.8$-$4.5$ times the inverse of the pion mass. Continuum extrapolations are carried out by using three different values of the lattice cut-off, corresponding to lattices with temporal extent $N_τ=6,\\ 8$ and $12$. After thermodynamic, continuum and chiral extrapolations we find the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c^0=132^{+3}_{-6}$ MeV.",

      "summary": "We investigate deep learning autoencoders for the unsupervised recognition of phase transitions in physical systems formulated on a lattice. We focus our investigation on the 2-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model and then test the application of the autoencoder on the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model. We use spin configurations produced for the 2-dimensional ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic Ising model in zero external magnetic field. For the ferromagnetic Ising model, we study numerically the relation between one latent variable extracted from the autoencoder to the critical temperature $T_c$. The proposed autoencoder reveals the two phases, one for which the spins are ordered and the other for which spins are disordered, reflecting the restoration of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry as the temperature increases. We provide a finite volume analysis for a sequence of increasing lattice sizes. For the largest volume studied, the transition between the two phases occurs very close to the theoretically extracted critical temperature. We define as a quasi-order parameter the absolute average latent variable ${\\tilde z}$, which enables us to predict the critical temperature. One can define a latent susceptibility and use it to quantify the value of the critical temperature $T_c(L)$ at different lattice sizes and that these values suffer from only small finite scaling effects. We demonstrate that $T_c(L)$ extrapolates to the known theoretical value as $L \\to \\infty$ suggesting that the autoencoder can also be used to extract the critical temperature of the phase transition to an adequate precision. Subsequently, we test the application of the autoencoder on the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model, demonstrating that the proposed network can detect the phase transition successfully in a similar way.",

      "summary": "We study the use of the complex-Langevin equation (CLE) to simulate lattice QCD at a finite chemical potential ($μ$) for quark-number, which has a complex fermion determinant that prevents the use of standard simulation methods based on importance sampling. Recent enhancements to the CLE specific to lattice QCD inhibit runaway solutions which had foiled earlier attempts to use it for such simulations. However, it is not guaranteed to produce correct results. Our goal is to determine under what conditions the CLE yields correct values for the observables of interest. Zero temperature simulations indicate that for moderate couplings, good agreement with expected results is obtained for small $μ$ and for $μ$ large enough to reach saturation, and that this agreement improves as we go to weaker coupling. For intermediate $μ$ values these simulations do not produce the correct physics. We compare our results with those of the phase-quenched approximation. Since there are indications that correct results might be obtained if the CLE trajectories remain close to the $SU(3)$ manifold, we study how the distance from this manifold depends on the quark mass and on the coupling. We find that this distance decreases with decreasing quark mass and as the coupling decreases, i.e. as the simulations approach the continuum limit.",

In this work we combine high statistics $N_f=2+1$ ensembles from the HotQCD collaboration with the effective theory NRQCD and improved Bayesian spectral reconstruction methods. We corroborate with high precision the hierarchical in-medium modification of quarkonium states with respect to their vacuum binding energy and provide updated values on melting temperatures. In particular we are able to understand previous disagreements between different Bayesian methods as resulting from underestimated systematic uncertainties. The main quantitative result is a robust determination of the in-medium mass shifts of quarkonium ground states, which we find are negative, consistent with the behavior observed in strongly coupled pNRQCD potential based computations.",

Using effective field theory we derive a formula for the conformal dimensions $D(j_L, j_R)$ of the leading operator in terms of two constants, $c_{3/2}$ and $c_{1/2}$, when the sum $j_L + j_R$ is much larger than the difference $|j_L-j_R|$. We compute $D(j_L,j_R)$ when $j_L = j_R$ with Monte Carlo calculations in a discrete formulation of the O(4) lattice field theory, and show excellent agreement with the predicted formula and estimate $c_{3/2}=1.068(4)$ and $c_{1/2}=0.083(3)$.",

More specifically, we report on the determination of the light-quark masses, the form factor $f_+(0)$ arising in the semileptonic $K \\to π$ transition at zero momentum transfer, as well as the decay constant ratio $f_K/f_π$ and its consequences for the CKM matrix elements $V_{us}$ and $V_{ud}$. Furthermore, we describe the results obtained on the lattice for some of the low-energy constants of $SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R$ and $SU(3)_L\\times SU(3)_R$ Chiral Perturbation Theory. We review the determination of the $B_K$ parameter of neutral kaon mixing as well as the additional four $B$ parameters that arise in theories of physics beyond the Standard Model. For the heavy-quark sector, we provide results for $m_c$ and $m_b$ as well as those for $D$- and $B$-meson decay constants, form factors, and mixing parameters. These are the heavy-quark quantities most relevant for the determination of CKM matrix elements and the global CKM unitarity-triangle fit. We review the status of lattice determinations of the strong coupling constant $α_s$. Finally, in this review we have added a new section reviewing results for nucleon matrix elements of the axial, scalar and tensor bilinears, both isovector and flavor diagonal.",

Although in these preliminary studies the quark masses are still set to larger than the physical values, a few results at the physical point can still be deduced from simple extrapolations in the quark masses. The progress paves the road towards obtaining several important quantities in nuclear physics, such as nuclear forces and nuclear matrix elements relevant for pp fusion, single and double-beta decay processes, neutrino-nucleus scattering, searches for CP violation, nuclear response in direct dark-matter detection experiments, as well as gluonic structure of nuclei for an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) program. Some of the recent developments, the results obtained, and the outlook of the field will be briefly reviewed in this talk, with a focus on results obtained by the Nuclear Physics From LQCD (NPLQCD) collaboration.",

      "summary": "We calculate the contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment hadronic vacuum polarization from {the} connected diagrams of up and down quarks, omitting electromagnetism. We employ QCD gauge-field configurations with dynamical $u$, $d$, $s$, and $c$ quarks and the physical pion mass, and analyze five ensembles with lattice spacings ranging from $a \\approx 0.06$ to~0.15~fm. The up- and down-quark masses in our simulations have equal masses $m_l$. We obtain, in this world where all pions have the mass of the $π^0$, $10^{10} a_μ^{ll}({\\rm conn.}) = 637.8\\,(8.8)$, in agreement with independent lattice-QCD calculations. We then combine this value with published lattice-QCD results for the connected contributions from strange, charm, and bottom quarks, and an estimate of the uncertainty due to the fact that our calculation does not include strong-isospin breaking, electromagnetism, or contributions from quark-disconnected diagrams. Our final result for the total $\\mathcal{O}(α^2)$ hadronic vacuum polarization to the muon's anomalous magnetic moment is~$10^{10}a_μ^{\\rm HVP,LO} = 699(15)_{u,d}(1)_{s,c,b}$, where the errors are from the light-quark and heavy-quark contributions, respectively. Our result agrees with both {\\it ab-initio} lattice-QCD calculations and phenomenological determinations from experimental $e^+e^-$-scattering data. It is $1.3σ$ below the \"no new physics\" value of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization contribution inferred from combining the BNL E821 measurement of $a_μ$ with theoretical calculations of the other contributions.",

By employing a variational method with a basis including operators resembling both the gluon string and systems of two separated static mesons, the first three energy levels are determined up to and beyond the distance where it is energetically favourable for the vacuum to screen the static sources through light- or strange-quark pair creation, enabling both these screening phenomena to be observed. The separation dependence of the energy spectrum is reliably parameterised over this saturation region with a simple model which can be used as input for subsequent investigations of quarkonia above threshold and heavy-light and heavy-strange coupled-channel meson scattering.",

      "summary": "We calculate the electric dipole moment of the nucleon induced by the QCD theta term. We use the gradient flow to define the topological charge and use $N_f = 2+1$ flavors of dynamical quarks corresponding to pion masses of $700$, $570$, and $410$ MeV, and perform an extrapolation to the physical point based on chiral perturbation theory. We perform calculations at $3$ different lattice spacings in the range of $0.07~{\\rm fm} < a < 0.11$ fm at a single value of the pion mass, to enable control on discretization effects. We also investigate finite size effects using $2$ different volumes. A novel technique is applied to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the form factor calculations. The very mild discretization effects observed suggest a continuum-like behavior of the nucleon EDM towards the chiral limit. Under this assumption our results read $d_{n}=-0.00152(71)\\ \\barθ e~\\text{fm}$ and $d_{p}=0.0011(10)\\ \\barθ e~\\text{fm}$. Assuming the theta term is the only source of CP violation, the experimental bound on the neutron electric dipole moment limits $\\left|\\barθ\\right| < 1.98\\times 10^{-10}$ ($90\\%$ CL). A first attempt at calculating the nucleon Schiff moment in the continuum resulted in $S_{p} = 0.50(59)\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\barθ e~\\text{fm}^3$ and $S_{n} = -0.10(43)\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\barθ e~\\text{fm}^3$.",

We give a systematic and in-depth account of the salient features entering in the evaluation of quasi-PDFs and their relation to the light-cone PDFs. In particular, we give details for the computation of the matrix elements, including the study of the various sources of systematic uncertainties, such as excited states contamination. In addition, we discuss the non-perturbative renormalization scheme used here and its systematics, effects of truncating the Fourier transform and different matching prescriptions.",

      "summary": "Within the framework of large momentum effective theory (LaMET), genenaralized parton distributions (GPDs) can be extracted from lattice calculations of quasi-GPDs through a perturbative matching relation, up to power corrections that are suppressed by the hadron momentum. In this paper, we focus on isovector quark GPDs, including the unpolarized, longitudinally and transversely polarized cases, and present the one-loop matching that connects the quasi-GPDs renormalized in a regularization-independent momentum subtraction (RI/MOM) scheme to the GPDs in MS scheme. We find that the matching coefficient is independent of the momentum transfer squared. As a consequence, the matching for the quasi-GPD with zero skewness is the same as that for the quasi-PDF. Our results provide a crucial input for the determination of quark GPDs from lattice QCD using LaMET.",

Results are extrapolated to the continuum physical point in the framework of hard pion/kaon SU(3) heavy-meson-staggered $χ$PT and Symanzik effective theory. Our calculation improves upon the precision achieved in existing lattice-QCD calculations of the vector form factors at $q^2=0$.

This work presents in detail the first lattice quantum chromodynamics calculations of the necessary neutron-antineutron transition matrix elements including calculation methods and discussions of systematic uncertainties. Implications of isospin and chiral symmetry on the matrix elements, power counting in the isospin limit, and renormalization of a chiral basis of six-quark operators are discussed. Calculations are performed with a chiral-symmetric discretization of the quark action and physical light quark masses in order to avoid the need for chiral extrapolation. Non-perturbative renormalization is performed, including a study of lattice cutoff effects. Excited-state effects are studied using two nucleon operators and multiple values of source-sink separation. Results for the dominant matrix elements are found to be significantly larger compared to previous results from the MIT bag model. Future calculations are needed to fully account for systematic uncertainties associated with discretization and finite-volume effects but are not expected to significantly affect this conclusion.",

Relativistic invariance plays an important role in this expansion. We find that $d$-wave two-particle channels enter first at quadratic order. We explain how to implement the resulting multichannel quantization condition, and present several examples of its application. We derive the leading dependence of the threshold three-particle state on the two-particle $d$-wave scattering amplitude, and use this to test our implementation. We show how strong two-particle $d$-wave interactions can lead to significant effects on the finite-volume three-particle spectrum, including the possibility of a generalized three-particle Efimov-like bound state. We also explore the application to the $3π^+$ system, which is accessible to lattice QCD simulations, where we study the sensitivity of the spectrum to the components of $\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathrm{df,3}}$. Finally, we investigate the circumstances under which the quantization condition has unphysical solutions.",

      "summary": "The dilaton low-energy effective field theory (EFT) of an emergent light scalar is probed in the paradigm of strongly coupled near-conformal gauge theories. These studies are motivated by models which exhibit small $β$-functions near the conformal window (CW), perhaps with slow scale-dependent walking and a light scalar with ${ 0^{++} }$ quantum numbers. We report our results from the hypothesis of a dilaton inspired EFT analysis with two massless fermions in the two-index symmetric (sextet) representation of the SU(3) color gauge group. With important caveats in our conclusions, conformal symmetry breaking entangled with chiral symmetry breaking would drive the near-conformal infrared behavior of the theory predicting characteristic dilaton signatures of the light scalar from broken scale invariance when probed on relevant scales of fermion mass deformations. From a recently reasoned choice of the dilaton potential in the EFT description~\\cite{Golterman:2016lsd} we find an unexpectedly light dilaton mass in the chiral limit at $m_d/f_π= 1.56(28)$, set in units of the pion decay constant $f_π$. Subject to further statistical and systematic tests of continued post-conference analysis, this result is significantly lower than our earlier estimates from less controlled extrapolations of the light scalar (the $σ$-particle) to the massless fermion limit of chiral perturbation theory. We also discuss important distinctions between the dilaton EFT analysis and the linear $σ$-model without dilaton signatures. For comparative reasons, we comment on dilaton tests from recent work with fermions in the fundamental representation with $n_f=8$ flavors.",

      "summary": "We discuss real time evolution for the quantum Ising model in one spatial dimension with $N_s$ sites. In the limit where the nearest neighbor interactions $J$ in the spatial directions are small, there is a simple physical picture where qubit states can be interpreted as approximate particle occupations. Using exact diagonalization, for initial states with one or two particles, we show that for small $J$, discrete Bessel functions provide very accurate expressions for the evolution of the occupancies corresponding to initial states with one and two particles. Boundary conditions play an important role when the evolution time is long enough. We discuss a Trotter procedure to implement the evolution on existing quantum computers and discuss the error associated with the Trotter step size. We discuss the effects of gate and measurement errors on the evolution of one and two particle states using 4 and 8 qubits circuits approximately corresponding to existing or near term quantum computers.",

      "summary": "Electric dipole moments (EDMs) of nucleons and nuclei, which are sought as evidence of CP violation, require lattice calculations to connect constraints from experiments to limits on the strong CP violation within QCD or CP violation introduced by new physics from beyond the standard model. Nucleon EDM calculations on a lattice are notoriously hard due to large statistical noise, chiral symmetry violating effects, and potential mixing of the EDM and the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon. In this report, details of ongoing lattice calculations of proton and neutron EDMs induced by the QCD $θ$-term and the quark chromo-EDM, the lowest-dimension effective CP-violating quark-gluon interaction are presented. Our calculation employs chiral-symmetric fermion discretization. An assessment of feasibility of nucleon EDM calculations at the physical point is discussed.",

In this study, we present and evaluate the efficiency of a selection of methods for inverse problems to reconstruct the full $x$-dependence of PDFs. Our starting point are the so called Ioffe time PDFs, which are accessible from Euclidean time calculations in conjunction with a matching procedure. Using realistic mock data tests, we find that the ill-posed incomplete Fourier transform underlying the reconstruction requires careful regularization, for which both the Bayesian approach as well as neural networks are efficient and flexible choices.",

We also show the result for an exploratory calculation of two-point functions of the $ΔS=1$ operators $Q_7$ and $Q_8$ that are in the $(8_L,8_R)$ representation of ${\\rm SU(3)}_L\\times{\\rm SU(3)}_R$ and mix with each other.",

      "summary": "We present the first exploratory lattice QCD calculation of the pion valence quark distribution extracted from spatially separated current-current correlations in coordinate space. We show that an antisymmetric combination of vector and axial-vector currents provides direct information on the pion valence quark distribution. Using the collinear factorization approach, we calculate the perturbative tree-level kernel for this current combination and extract the pion valence distribution. The main goal of this article is to demonstrate the efficacy of this general lattice QCD approach in the reliable extraction of parton distributions. With controllable power corrections and a good understanding of the lattice systematics, this method has the potential to serve as a complementary to the many efforts to extract parton distributions in global analyses from experimentally measured cross sections. We perform our calculation on an ensemble of 2+1 flavor QCD using the isotropic-clover fermion action, with lattice dimensions $32^3\\times 96$ at a lattice spacing \\mbox{$a=0.127$ fm} and the quark mass equivalent to a pion mass $m_π\\simeq 416$ MeV.",

The continuum calculations were performed in dimensional regularization, and the lattice calculations for the Wilson/clover fermion action and for a variety of Symanzik-improved gauge actions. We extract the strength of the one-loop linear and logarithmic divergences (including cusp divergences), which appear in such nonlocal operators; we identify the mixing pairs which occur among some of these operators on the lattice, and we calculate the corresponding mixing coefficients. We also provide the appropriate RI'-like scheme, which disentangles this mixing nonperturbatively from lattice simulation data, as well as the one-loop expressions of the conversion factors, which turn the lattice data to the MS-bar scheme. Our results can be immediately used for improving recent nonperturbative investigations of transverse momentum-dependent distribution functions (TMDs) on the lattice. Finally, extending our perturbative study to general Wilson-line lattice operators with n cusps, we present results for their renormalization factors, including identification of mixing and determination of the corresponding mixing coefficients, based on our results for the staple operators.",

We find that cooling scales exhibit similarly good scaling behavior as gradient scales, while being computationally more efficient. In addition, we estimate systematic error in continuum limit extrapolations of scale ratios by comparing standard scaling to asymptotic scaling. Finally we study topological observables in pure SU(2) using cooling to smooth the gauge fields, and investigate the sensitivity of cooling scales to topological charge. We find that large numbers of cooling sweeps lead to metastable charge sectors, without destroying physical instantons, provided the lattice spacing is fine enough and the volume is large enough. Continuum limit estimates of the topological susceptibility are obtained, of which we favor $χ^{1/4}/T_c = 0.643(12)$. Differences between cooling scales in different topological sectors turn out to be too small to be detectable within our statistical error.",

At the smallest and largest lattice spacing the light-quark sea mass is set to 1/10 the strange-quark mass. At the intermediate lattice spacing, we use four values for the light-quark sea mass ranging from 1/5 to 1/20 of the strange-quark mass. We use the asqtad improved staggered action for the light valence quarks, and the clover action with the Fermilab interpolation for the heavy valence bottom quark. We use SU(2) hard-kaon heavy-meson rooted staggered chiral perturbation theory to take the chiral-continuum limit. A functional $z$ expansion is used to extend the form factors to the full kinematic range. We present predictions for the differential decay rate for both $B_s\\to Kμν$ and $B_s\\to Kτν$.

      "summary": "Quark orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the proton can be calculated directly given a Wigner function encoding the simultaneous distribution of quark transverse positions and momenta. This distribution can be accessed via proton matrix elements of a quark bilocal operator (the separation in which is Fourier conjugate to the quark momentum) featuring a momentum transfer (which is Fourier conjugate to the quark position). To generate the weighting by quark transverse position needed to calculate OAM, a derivative with respect to momentum transfer is consequently required. This derivative is evaluated using a direct derivative method, i.e., a method in which the momentum derivative of a correlator is directly sampled in the lattice calculation, as opposed to extracting it a posteriori from the numerical correlator data. The method removes the bias stemming from estimating the derivative a posteriori that was seen to afflict a previous exploratory calculation. Data for Ji OAM generated on a clover ensemble at pion mass $m_{π} = 317\\, \\mbox{MeV} $ are seen to agree with the result obtained via the traditional Ji sum rule method. By varying the gauge connection in the quark bilocal operator, also Jaffe-Manohar OAM is extracted, and seen to be enhanced significantly compared to Ji OAM.",

      "summary": "Most strong-interaction resonances have decay channels involving three or more particles, including many of the recently discovered $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ resonances. In order to study such resonances from first principles using lattice QCD, one must understand finite-volume effects for three particles in the cubic box used in calculations. Here we review efforts to develop a three-particle quantization condition that relates finite-volume energies to infinite-volume scattering amplitudes. We describe in detail the three approaches that have been followed, and present new results on the relationship between the corresponding results. We show examples of the numerical implementation of all three approaches and point out the important issues that remain to be resolved.",

      "summary": "We present preliminary blinded results from our analysis of the form factors for $B\\rightarrow D^\\ast\\ellν$ decay at non-zero recoil. Our analysis includes 15 MILC asqtad ensembles with $N_f=2+1$ flavors of sea quarks and lattice spacings ranging from $a\\approx 0.15$ fm down to $0.045$ fm. The valence light quarks employ the asqtad action, whereas the $b$ and $c$ quarks are treated using the Fermilab action. We discuss the impact that our results will have on $\\left|V_{cb}\\right|$ and $R(D^\\ast)$.",
