      "summary": "This work explores scattering amplitudes that couple two-particle systems via a single external current insertion, $2+\\mathcal{J}\\to 2$. Such amplitudes can provide structural information about the excited QCD spectrum. We derive an exact analytic representation for these reactions. From these amplitudes, we show how to rigorously define resonance and bound-state form-factors. Furthermore, we explore the consequences of the narrow-width limit of the amplitudes as well as the role of the Ward-Takahashi identity for conserved vector currents. These results hold for any number of two-body channels with no intrinsic spin, and a current with arbitrary Lorentz structure and quantum numbers. This work and the existing finite-volume formalism provide a complete framework for determining this class of amplitudes from lattice QCD.",

      "summary": "As a solution towards the numerical sign problem, we propose a novel Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm, in which molecular dynamics is performed on a continuum set of integration surfaces foliated by the antiholomorphic gradient flow (\"the worldvolume of an integration surface\"). This is an extension of the tempered Lefschetz thimble method (TLTM), and solves the sign and multimodal problems simultaneously as the original TLTM does. Furthermore, in this new algorithm, one no longer needs to compute the Jacobian of the gradient flow in generating a configuration, and only needs to evaluate its phase upon measurement. To demonstrate that this algorithm works correctly, we apply the algorithm to a chiral random matrix model, for which the complex Langevin method is known not to work.",

The quark mass contribution $\\langle H_m\\rangle$ and the momentum fraction $\\langle x\\rangle$ of valence charm quark and antiquark are calculated for conventional $1S,1P,1D$ charmonia and the exotic $1^{-+}$ charmoniumlike state, based on the $N_f=2+1$ gauge configurations generated by the RBC/UKQCD collaboration. It is found that $\\langle H_m\\rangle$ is close to each other and around 2.0 to 2.2 GeV for these states, which implies that the mass splittings among these states come almost from the gluon contribution of QCD trace anomaly. The $\\langle x\\rangle$ of the $1^{-+}$ state is only around 0.55, while that in conventional charmonia is around 0.7 to 0.8. This difference manifests that the proportion of light quarks and gluons in the $1^{-+}$ charmoniumlike state is significantly larger than conventional states.",

We compare results for three different fermion actions with or without good chiral symmetry on dynamical gauge ensembles from three collaborations. This investigation is motivated by the fact that the gauge link generates an $1/a$ divergence, the cancelation of which in many ratios can be numerically tricky. Indeed, our results show that this cancelation deteriorates with decreasing lattice spacing, and that the RI/MOM method leaves a linearly divergent residue for quasi-PDFs. We also show that in the Landau gauge the interaction between the Wilson link and the external state results in a linear divergence which depends on the discretized fermion action.",

      "summary": "Certain aspects of some unitary quantum systems are well-described by evolution via a non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian, as in the Wigner-Weisskopf theory for spontaneous decay. Conversely, any non-Hermitian Hamiltonian evolution can be accommodated in a corresponding unitary system + environment model via a generalization of Wigner-Weisskopf theory. This demonstrates the physical relevance of novel features such as exceptional points in quantum dynamics, and opens up avenues for studying many body systems in the complex plane of coupling constants. In the case of lattice field theory, sparsity lends these channels the promise of efficient simulation on standardized quantum hardware. We thus consider quantum operations that correspond to Suzuki-Lee-Trotter approximation of lattice field theories undergoing non-Hermitian time evolution, with potential applicability to studies of spin or gauge models at finite chemical potential, with topological terms, to quantum phase transitions - a range of models with sign problems. We develop non-Hermitian quantum circuits and explore their promise on a benchmark, the quantum one-dimensional Ising model with complex longitudinal magnetic field, showing that observables can probe the Lee-Yang edge singularity. The development of attractors past critical points in the space of complex couplings indicates a potential for study on near-term noisy hardware.",

Using a world-line Monte Carlo method we show that the model reproduces the universal step-scaling function of the traditional model up to correlation lengths of 200,000 in lattice units and argue how the continuum limit could emerge.

      "summary": "Neutrinoless double-$β$ ($0νββ$) decay of certain atomic isotopes, if observed, will have significant implications for physics of neutrinos and models of physics beyond the Standard Model. In the simplest scenario, if the mass of the light neutrino of the Standard Model has a Majorana component, it can mediate the decay. Systematic theoretical studies of the decay rate in this scenario, through effective field theories matched to \\emph{ab initio} nuclear many-body calculations, are needed to draw conclusions about the hierarchy of neutrino masses, and to plan the design of future experiments. However, a recently identified short-distance contribution at leading order in the effective field theory amplitude of the subprocess $nn \\to pp\\,(ee)$ remains unknown, and only lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) can directly and reliably determine the associated low-energy constant. While the numerical computations of the correlation function for this process are underway with lattice QCD, the connection to the physical amplitude, and hence this short-distance contribution, is missing. A complete framework that enables this complex matching is developed in this paper. The complications arising from Euclidean and finite-volume nature of the corresponding correlation function are fully resolved, and the value of the formalism is demonstrated through a simple example. The result of this work, therefore, fills the gap between first-principle studies of the $nn \\to pp\\,(ee)$ amplitude from lattice QCD and those from effective field theory, and can be readily employed in the ongoing lattice-QCD studies of this process.",

      "summary": "We investigate unpolarized and polarized gluon distributions and their applications to the Ioffe-time distributions, which are related to lattice QCD calculations of parton distribution functions. Guided by the counting rules based on the perturbative QCD at large momentum fraction $x$ and the color coherence of gluon couplings at small $x$, we parametrize gluon distributions in the helicity basis. By fitting the unpolarized gluon distribution, the inferred polarized gluon distribution from our parametrization agrees with the one from global analysis. A simultaneous fit to both unpolarized and polarized gluon distributions is also performed to explore the model uncertainty. The agreement with the global analysis supports the $(1-x)$ power suppression of the helicity-antialigned distribution relative to the helicity-aligned distribution. The corresponding Ioffe-time distributions and their asymptotic expansions are calculated from the gluon distributions. Our results of the Ioffe-time distributions can provide guidance to the extrapolation of lattice QCD data to the region lacking precise gluonic matrix elements. Therefore, they can help regulate the ill-posed inverse problem associated with extracting the gluon distributions from discrete data from first-principle calculations, which are available in a limited range of the nucleon momentum and the spatial separation between the gluonic currents. Given various limitations in obtaining lattice QCD data at large Ioffe time, phenomenological approaches can provide important complementary information to extract the gluon distributions in the entire $x$ region. The possibility of investigating higher-twist effects and other systematic uncertainties in the contemporary first-principle calculations of parton distributions from phenomenologically well-determined Ioffe-time distributions in the large Ioffe-time region is also discussed.",

The lattice results are calculated using ensembles with multiple sea pion masses with the lightest one around 135~MeV, 3 lattice spacings $a\\in[0.06,0.12]$~fm, and multiple volumes with $M_πL$ ranging 3.3 to 5.5. We perform a simultaneous chiral-continuum extrapolation to obtain RI/MOM renormalized nucleon matrix elements with various Wilson-link displacements in the continuum limit at physical pion mass. Then, we apply one-loop perturbative matching to the quasi-PDFs to obtain the lightcone PDFs. We find the lattice-spacing dependence to be much larger than the dependence on pion mass and lattice volume for these LaMET matrix elements. Our physical-continuum limit unpolarized isovector nucleon PDFs are found to be consistent with global-PDF results.",

When the spin asymmetry is defined as the ratio of the quark Sivers function over the spin averaged distribution, it can be directly calculated in terms of the relevant quasi distributions with the soft functions and perturbative matching kernels cancelling out. Apart from the general formula presented, we have verified the result in the small transverse distance limit at one-loop order, which reduces to a collinear expansion at twist-three level.",

      "summary": "We introduce a half-filled Hamiltonian of spin-half lattice fermions that can be studied with the efficient meron-cluster algorithm in any dimension. As with the usual bipartite half-filled Hubbard models, the naïve $U(2)$ symmetry is enhanced to $SO(4)$. On the other hand our model has a novel spin-charge flip ${\\mathbb Z}^C_2$ symmetry which is an important ingredient of free massless fermions. In this work we focus on one spatial dimension, and show that our model can be viewed as a lattice-regularized two-flavor chiral-mass Gross-Neveu model. Our model remains solvable in the presence of the Hubbard coupling $U$, which maps to a combination of Gross-Neveu and Thirring couplings in one dimension. Using the meron-cluster algorithm we find that the ground state of our model is a valence bond solid when $U=0$. From our field theory analysis, we argue that the valence bond solid forms inevitably because of an interesting frustration between spin and charge sectors in the renormalization group flow enforced by the ${\\mathbb Z}^C_2$ symmetry. This state spontaneously breaks translation symmetry by one lattice unit, which can be identified with a $\\mathbb{Z}_2^χ$ chiral symmetry in the continuum. We show that increasing $U$ induces a quantum phase transition to a critical phase described by the $SU(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten theory. The quantum critical point between these two phases is known to exhibit a novel symmetry enhancement between spin and dimer. Here we verify the scaling relations of these correlation functions near the critical point numerically. Our study opens up the exciting possibility of numerical access to similar novel phase transitions in higher dimensions in fermionic lattice models using the meron-cluster algorithm.",

      "summary": "We report on a sub-percent scale determination using the omega baryon mass and gradient-flow methods. The calculations are performed on 22 ensembles of $N_f=2+1+1$ highly improved, rooted staggered sea-quark configurations generated by the MILC and CalLat Collaborations. The valence quark action used is Möbius Domain-Wall fermions solved on these configurations after a gradient-flow smearing is applied with a flowtime of $t_{\\rm gf}=1$ in lattice units. The ensembles span four lattice spacings in the range $0.06 \\lesssim a \\lesssim 0.15$ fm, six pion masses in the range $130 \\lesssim m_π\\lesssim 400$ MeV and multiple lattice volumes. On each ensemble, the gradient-flow scales $t_0/a^2$ and $w_0/a$ and the omega baryon mass $a m_Ω$ are computed. The dimensionless product of these quantities is then extrapolated to the continuum and infinite volume limits and interpolated to the physical light, strange and charm quark mass point in the isospin limit, resulting in the determination of $\\sqrt{t_0}=0.1422(14)$ fm and $w_0 = 0.1709(11)$ fm with all sources of statistical and systematic uncertainty accounted for. The dominant uncertainty in this result is the stochastic uncertainty, providing a clear path for a few-per-mille uncertainty, as recently obtained by the Budapest-Marseille-Wuppertal Collaboration.",

Attention is given to understanding and controlling the contributions of excited states. The final results are obtained using a simultaneous fit in the lattice spacing $a$, pion mass $M_π$ and the finite volume parameter $M_πL$ keeping leading order corrections. The data show no significant dependence on the lattice spacing and some evidence for finite-volume corrections. The main variation is with $M_π$, whose magnitude depends on the mass gap of the first excited state used in the analysis. Our final results, in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme at 2 GeV, are $\\langle x \\rangle_{u-d} = 0.160(16)(20)$, $\\langle x \\rangle_{Δu-Δd} = 0.192(13)(20)$ and $\\langle x \\rangle_{δu-δd} = 0.215(17)(20)$, where the first error is the overall analysis uncertainty assuming excited-state contributions have been removed, and the second is an additional systematic uncertainty due to possible residual excited-state contributions. These results are consistent with other recent lattice calculations and phenomenological global fit values.",

We provide the generalization to the case of three nondegenerate scalar particles with arbitrary masses. A key quantity in this formalism is the quantization condition, which relates the spectrum to an intermediate K matrix. We derive three versions of this quantization condition, each a natural generalization of the corresponding results for identical particles. In each case we also determine the integral equations relating the intermediate K matrix to the three-particle scattering amplitude, $\\mathcal M_3$. The version that is likely to be most practical involves a single Lorentz-invariant intermediate K matrix, $\\widetilde{\\mathcal K}_{\\rm df,3}$. The other versions involve a matrix of K matrices, with elements distinguished by the choice of which initial and final particles are the spectators. Our approach should allow a straightforward generalization of the relativistic approach to all other three-particle systems of interest.",

We demonstrate hyperscaling, predict the anomalous mass dimension of the corresponding conformal fixed point, and show that in the investigated mass regime the data are described by dilaton chiral perturbation theory. The proximity of a conformal infrared fixed point leads to a highly predictive particle spectrum which is quite distinct from QCD. Further we present initial results of our finite temperature investigations.",

      "summary": "We present results from lattice QCD calculations for $2^{nd}$ and $4^{th}$ order cumulants of conserved charge fluctuations and correlations, and compare these with various HRG model calculations. We show that differences between HRG and QCD calculations already show up in the second order cumulants close to the pseudo-critical temperature for the chiral transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD and quickly grow large at higher temperatures. We also show that QCD results for strangeness fluctuations are enhanced over HRG model calculations which are based only on particles listed in the Particle Data Group tables as 3-star resonances. This suggests the importance of contributions from additional strange hadron resonances. We furthermore argue that additional (repulsive) interactions, introduced either through excluded volume (mean field) HRG models or the S-matrix approach, do not improve the quantitative agreement with $2^{nd}$ and $4^{th}$ order cumulants calculated in lattice QCD. HRG based approaches fail to describe the thermodynamics of strongly interacting matter at or shortly above the pseudo-critical temperature of QCD.",

      "summary": "The quasi-PDF approach provides a path to computing parton distribution functions (PDFs) using lattice QCD. This approach requires matrix elements of a power-divergent operator in a nucleon at high momentum and one generically expects discretization effects starting at first order in the lattice spacing $a$. Therefore, it is important to demonstrate that the continuum limit can be reliably taken and to understand the size and shape of lattice artifacts. In this work, we report a calculation of isovector unpolarized and helicity PDFs using lattice ensembles with $N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson twisted mass fermions, a pion mass of approximately 370 MeV, and three different lattice spacings. Our results show a significant dependence on $a$, and the continuum extrapolation produces a better agreement with phenomenology. The latter is particularly true for the antiquark distribution at small momentum fraction $x$, where the extrapolation changes its sign.",

      "summary": "In the heavy, static quark mass regime of QCD, the Polyakov loop is well known to be an order parameter of the deconfinement phase transition; however, the sensitivity of the Polyakov loop to the deconfinement of light, dynamical quarks is less clear. On the other hand, from the perspective of an effective Lagrangian written in the vicinity of the chiral transition, the Polyakov loop is an energy-like operator and should hence scale as any energy-like operator would. We show here that the Polyakov loop and heavy-quark free energy are sensitive to the chiral transition, i.e. their scaling is consistent with energy-like observables in 3-$d$ $O(N)$ universality classes.",

We propose and calculate two novel estimators for the chiral transition temperature for several values of the light quark masses, corresponding to Goldstone pion masses in the range of $58~{\\rm MeV}\\lesssim m_π\\lesssim 163~{\\rm MeV}$. The chiral phase transition temperature is determined by extrapolating to vanishing pion mass using universal scaling relations. After thermodynamic, continuum and chiral extrapolations we find the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c^0=132^{+3}_{-6}$ MeV. We also show some preliminary calculations that use the conventional estimator for the pseudo-critical temperature and compare with the new estimators for $T_c^0$. Furthermore, we show results for the ratio of the chiral order parameter and its susceptibility and argue that this ratio can be used to differentiate between $O(N)$ and $Z_2$ universality classes in a non-parametric manner.",

Using these relations we present lattice QCD results for $\\partial^{n}ρ(λ, m_{l})/\\partial m_{l}^n$ ($n=1, 2, 3$) for $m_{l}$ corresponding to pion masses $m_π=160-55$ MeV, and at a temperature of about 1.6 times the chiral phase transition temperature. Calculations were carried out using (2+1) flavors of highly improved staggered quarks with the physical value of strange quark mass, three lattice spacings $a=0.12, 0.08, 0.06$ fm, and lattices having aspect ratios $4-9$. We find that $ρ(λ\\to0, m_{l})$ develops a peaked structure. This peaked structure arises due to non-Poisson correlations within the infrared part of the Dirac eigenvalue spectrum, becomes sharper as $a\\to0$, and its amplitude is proportional to $m_{l}^2$. We demonstrate that this $ρ(λ\\to0,m_l)$ is responsible for the manifestations of axial anomaly in two-point correlation functions of light scalar and pseudoscalar mesons. After continuum and chiral extrapolations we find that axial anomaly remains manifested in two-point correlation functions of scalar and pseudoscalar mesons in the chiral limit.",

The unprecedented statistics of present and future Hadron Experiments, modern Lattice QCD calculations, and the wealth of new states and decays, require such precise and model-independent analyses to describe final state interactions. We review the existing and often conflicting data and explain in detail the derivation of the relevant dispersion relations, maximizing their applicability range. Next, we review and extend the caveats on some data, showing their inconsistency with dispersion relations. Our main result is the derivation and compilation of precise amplitude parameterizations constrained by several $πK\\to πK$ and $ππ\\to K \\bar{K}$ dispersion relations. These constrained parameterizations are easily implementable and provide the rigor and accuracy needed for modern experimental and phenomenological Hadron Physics. As applications, after reviewing their status and interest, we will provide new precise threshold and subthreshold parameters and review our dispersive determination of the controversial $κ/K^*_0(700)$ resonance and other light-strange resonances.",

      "summary": "This work continues our program of lattice-QCD baryon physics using staggered fermions for both the sea and valence quarks. We present a proof-of-concept study that demonstrates, for the first time, how to calculate baryon matrix elements using staggered quarks for the valence sector. We show how to relate the representations of the continuum staggered flavor-taste group $\\text{SU}(8)_{FT}$ to those of the discrete lattice symmetry group. The resulting calculations yield the normalization factors relating staggered baryon matrix elements to their physical counterparts. We verify this methodology by calculating the isovector vector and axial-vector charges $g_V$ and $g_A$. We use a single ensemble from the MILC Collaboration with 2+1+1 flavors of sea quark, lattice spacing $a\\approx 0.12$ fm, and a pion mass $M_π\\approx305$ MeV. On this ensemble, we find results consistent with expectations from current conservation and neutron beta decay. Thus, this work demonstrates how highly-improved staggered quarks can be used for precision calculations of baryon properties, and, in particular, the isovector nucleon charges.",

      "summary": "We present a systematically improvable method for numerically solving relativistic three-body integral equations for the partial-wave projected amplitudes. The method consists of a discretization procedure in momentum space, which approximates the continuum problem with a matrix equation. It is solved for different matrix sizes, and in the end, an extrapolation is employed to restore the continuum limit. Our technique is tested by solving a three-body problem of scalar particles with an $S$ wave two-body bound state. We discuss two methods of incorporating the pole contribution in the integral equations, both of them leading to agreement with previous results obtained using finite-volume spectra of the same theory. We provide an analytic and numerical estimate of the systematic errors. Although we focus on kinematics below the three-particle threshold, we provide numerical evidence that the methods presented allow for determination of amplitude above this threshold as well.",

We derive the light-front sum rules for the scalar charge and Coulomb energy, expressed in terms of the light-front wave functions, and find that they are regular at $x=0$ without the delta function contribution.

We show that these lattice models can be reformulated using tensorial methods where the field integrations in the path-integral formalism are replaced by discrete sums. These formulations involve various types of duality and provide exact coarse-graining formulas which can be combined with truncations to obtain practical implementations of the Wilson renormalization group program. Tensor reformulations are naturally discrete and provide manageable transfer matrices. Combining truncations with the time continuum limit, we derive Hamiltonians suitable to perform quantum simulation experiments, for instance using cold atoms, or to be programmed on existing quantum computers. We review recent progress concerning the tensor field theory treatment of non-compact scalar models, supersymmetric models, economical four-dimensional algorithms, noise-robust enforcement of Gauss's law, symmetry preserving truncations and topological considerations. We discuss connections with other tensor network approaches.",

We also obtain directly, for the first time, $\\langle x \\rangle$ and $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ for the kaon using local operators. We use an ensemble of two degenerate light, a strange and a charm quark ($N_f=2+1+1$) of maximally twisted mass fermions with clover improvement. The quark masses are chosen so that they reproduce a pion mass of about 260 MeV, and a kaon mass of 530 MeV. The lattice spacing of the ensemble is 0.093 fm and the lattice has a spatial extent of 3 fm. We analyze several values of the source-sink time separation within the range of $1.12-2.23$ fm to study and eliminate excited-states contributions. The necessary renormalization functions are calculated non-perturbatively in the RI$'$ scheme, and are converted to the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme at a scale of 2 GeV. The final values for the momentum fraction are $\\langle x \\rangle^π_{u^+}=0.261(3)_{\\rm stat}(6)_{\\rm syst}$, $\\langle x \\rangle^K_{u^+}=0.246(2)_{\\rm stat}(2)_{\\rm syst}$, and $\\langle x \\rangle^K_{s^+}=0.317(2)_{\\rm stat}(1)_{\\rm syst}$. For the third Mellin moments we find $\\langle x^2 \\rangle^π_{u^+}=0.082(21)_{\\rm stat}(17)_{\\rm syst}$, $\\langle x^2 \\rangle^K_{u^+}=0.093(5)_{\\rm stat}(3)_{\\rm syst}$, and $\\langle x^2 \\rangle^K_{s^+}=0.134(5)_{\\rm stat}(2)_{\\rm syst}$. The reported systematic uncertainties are due to excited-state contamination. We also give the ratio $\\langle x^2 \\rangle/\\langle x \\rangle$ which is an indication of how quickly the PDFs lose support at large $x$.",

These calculations are based on matrix elements of boosted hadrons coupled to non-local operators and can be related to the standard, light-cone distribution functions via an appropriate factorization formalism. There is significant progress in several directions, including calculations of flavor singlet parton distribution functions (PDFs), first calculations of generalized parton distributions (GPDs), as well as the implementation of some of the approaches for the transverse-momentum-dependent PDFs (TMD PDFs). This new direction of lattice calculations is particularly interesting for phenomenological fits on experimental data sets, as the lattice results can help to improve the constraints on the distribution functions.",

From this we obtain the contribution of the new strong sector to the $S$ parameter. This leads to an upper bound on the vacuum misalignment parameter $ξ$ which is similar to current estimates of this bound. Our result agrees with large-$N_c$ scaling expectations, within large systematic uncertainties.",

We put the phenomena related to the color screening into the context of similar aspects of other physical systems (electromagnetic plasma or cold nuclear matter). We discuss the onset of the color screening and its signature and significance in the QCD transition region, and elucidate at which temperature and to which extent the weak-coupling picture based on hard thermal loop expansion, potential nonrelativistic QCD, or dimensionally-reduced QCD quantitatively captures the key properties of the color screening. We discuss the different regimes pertaining to the color screening and thermal dissociation of the static quarks in depth for various spatial correlation functions that are studied on the lattice, and clarify the status of their asymptotic screening masses. We finally discuss the screening correlation functions of dynamical mesons with a wide range of flavor and spin content, and how they conform with expectations for low- and high-temperature behavior.",

      "summary": "The magnetic polarizability of the neutral pion has been calculated in the background magnetic-field formalism of Lattice QCD. In this investigation, the chiral extrapolation of these lattice results is considered in a formalism preserving the exact leading nonanalytic terms of chiral perturbation theory. The $n_f = 2 + 1$ numerical simulations are electro-quenched, such that the virtual sea-quarks of the QCD vacuum do not interact with the background field. To understand the impact of this, we draw on partially quenched chiral perturbation theory and identify the leading contributions of quark-flow connected and disconnected diagrams. While electro-quenching does not impact the leading-loop contribution to the magnetic polarizability, the loops which generate the leading term have yet to be considered in lattice QCD simulations. Lattice QCD results are used to constrain the analytic terms in the chiral expansion and supplementing those with the two-loop result from chiral perturbation theory enables an evaluation of the polarizability at the physical quark mass. The resulting magnetic polarizability of the neutral pion is $β_{π^0}=3.44(19)^{\\rm stat}(37)^{\\rm syst}\\times 10^{-4}$ fm$^3$, which lies just above the $1 σ$ error bound of the experimental measurement.",

For the unpolarized sector, we find rather weak constraints from the current lattice data on the phenomenological PDFs, and difficulties in describing the lattice matrix elements at large spatial distances. In contrast, for the polarized PDFs we find good agreement between experiment and lattice data, with the latter providing significant constraints on the spin-dependent isovector quark and antiquark distributions.",

Taking one cycle to have anti-periodic fermion boundary conditions, the large-torus limit is described by certain Euclidean black holes. We compute the bosonic action---the variation of the partition function---and compare our numerical results to the supergravity prediction as the size of the torus is changed, keeping its shape fixed. Our lattice calculations primarily utilize $N = 8$ with extrapolations to the continuum limit, and our results are consistent with the expected gravity behavior in the appropriate large-torus limit.",

      "summary": "The global $SU(3)$ color symmetry and its physical consequences are discussed. The Nöther current is actually governed by the conserved matter current of color charges if the color field generated by this charge is properly polarized. The color field strength of a charge can have a uniform part due to the nontrivial QCD vacuum field and the nonzero gluon condensate, which implies that the self-energy of a system with a net color charge is infinite and thereby cannot exist as a free state. This is precisely what the color confinement means. Accordingly, the Cornell type potential with the feature of the Casimir scaling is derived for a color singlet system composed of a static color charge and an anti-charge. The uniform color field also implies that a hadron has a minimal size and a minimal energy. Furthermore, the global $SU(3)$ color symmetry requires that the minimal irreducible color singlet systems can only be $q\\bar{q}$, $qqq$, $gg$, $ggg$, $q\\bar{q}g$, $qqqg$ and $\\bar{q}\\bar{q}\\bar{q}g$, etc., as such a multi-quark systems can only exist as a molecular configurations if there are no other binding mechanisms.",

      "summary": "The interactions between two octet baryons are studied at low energies using lattice QCD (LQCD) with larger-than-physical quark masses corresponding to a pion mass of $m_π\\sim 450$ MeV and a kaon mass of $m_{K}\\sim 596$ MeV. The two-baryon systems that are analyzed range from strangeness $S=0$ to $S=-4$ and include the spin-singlet and triplet $NN$, $ΣN$ ($I=3/2$), and $ΞΞ$ states, the spin-singlet $ΣΣ$ ($I=2$) and $ΞΣ$ ($I=3/2$) states, and the spin-triplet $ΞN$ ($I=0$) state. The $s$-wave scattering phase shifts, low-energy scattering parameters, and binding energies when applicable, are extracted using Lüscher's formalism. While the results are consistent with most of the systems being bound at this pion mass, the interactions in the spin-triplet $ΣN$ and $ΞΞ$ channels are found to be repulsive and do not support bound states. Using results from previous studies at a larger pion mass, an extrapolation of the binding energies to the physical point is performed and is compared with experimental values and phenomenological predictions. The low-energy coefficients in pionless EFT relevant for two-baryon interactions, including those responsible for $SU(3)$ flavor-symmetry breaking, are constrained. The $SU(3)$ symmetry is observed to hold approximately at the chosen values of the quark masses, as well as the $SU(6)$ spin-flavor symmetry, predicted at large $N_c$. A remnant of an accidental $SU(16)$ symmetry found previously at a larger pion mass is further observed. The $SU(6)$-symmetric EFT constrained by these LQCD calculations is used to make predictions for two-baryon systems for which the low-energy scattering parameters could not be determined with LQCD directly in this study, and to constrain the coefficients of all leading $SU(3)$ flavor-symmetric interactions, demonstrating the predictive power of two-baryon EFTs matched to LQCD.",

      "summary": "We report on the first application of the stochastic Laplacian Heaviside method for computing multi-particle interactions with lattice QCD to the two-nucleon system. Like the Laplacian Heaviside method, this method allows for the construction of interpolating operators which can be used to construct a positive definite set of two-nucleon correlation functions, unlike nearly all other applications of lattice QCD to two nucleons in the literature. It also allows for a variational analysis in which optimal linear combinations of the interpolating operators are formed that couple predominantly to the eigenstates of the system. Utilizing such methods has become of paramount importance in order to help resolve the discrepancy in the literature on whether two nucleons in either isospin channel form a bound state at pion masses heavier than physical, with the discrepancy persisting even in the $SU(3)$-flavor symmetric point with all quark masses near the physical strange quark mass. This is the first in a series of papers aimed at resolving this discrepancy. In the present work, we employ the stochastic Laplacian Heaviside method without a hexaquark operator in the basis at a lattice spacing of $a\\sim0.086$~fm, lattice volume of $L=48a\\simeq4.1$~fm and pion mass $m_π\\simeq714$ MeV. With this setup, the observed spectrum of two-nucleon energy levels strongly disfavors the presence of a bound state in either the deuteron or dineutron channel.",

      "title": "Search for Efficient Formulations for Hamiltonian Simulation of non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theories",
      "summary": "Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) is the most natural framework for the purpose of quantum simulation, an area of research that is growing with advances in quantum-computing algorithms and hardware. It, therefore, remains an important task to identify the most accurate, while computationally economic, Hamiltonian formulation(s) in such theories, considering the necessary truncation imposed on the Hilbert space of gauge bosons with any finite computing resources. This paper is a first step toward addressing this question in the case of non-Abelian LGTs, which further require the imposition of non-Abelian Gauss's laws on the Hilbert space, introducing additional computational complexity. Focusing on the case of SU(2) LGT in 1+1 D coupled to matter, a number of different formulations of the original Kogut-Susskind framework are analyzed with regard to the dependence of the dimension of the physical Hilbert space on boundary conditions, system's size, and the cutoff on the excitations of gauge bosons. The impact of such dependencies on the accuracy of the spectrum and dynamics is examined, and the (classical) computational-resource requirements given these considerations are studied. Besides the well-known angular-momentum formulation of the theory, the cases of purely fermionic and purely bosonic formulations (with open boundary conditions), and the Loop-String-Hadron formulation are analyzed, along with a brief discussion of a Quantum Link Model of the same theory. Clear advantages are found in working with the Loop-String-Hadron framework which implements non-Abelian Gauss's laws a priori using a complete set of gauge-invariant operators. Although small lattices are studied in the numerical analysis of this work, and only the simplest algorithms are considered, a range of conclusions will be applicable to larger systems and potentially to higher dimensions.",

      "summary": "We study the machine learning techniques applied to the lattice gauge theory's critical behavior, particularly to the confinement/deconfinement phase transition in the SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories. We find that the neural network, trained on lattice configurations of gauge fields at an unphysical value of the lattice parameters as an input, builds up a gauge-invariant function, and finds correlations with the target observable that is valid in the physical region of the parameter space. In particular, if the algorithm aimed to predict the Polyakov loop as the deconfining order parameter, it builds a trace of the gauge group matrices along a closed loop in the time direction. As a result, the neural network, trained at one unphysical value of the lattice coupling $β$ predicts the order parameter in the whole region of the $β$ values with good precision. We thus demonstrate that the machine learning techniques may be used as a numerical analog of the analytical continuation from easily accessible but physically uninteresting regions of the coupling space to the interesting but potentially not accessible regions.",

Traditional quark smearing algorithms are commonly used tools to improve the statistical quality of hadronic $n$-point functions, provided operator momenta are small. The momentum smearing algorithm of Bali et al. extends the range of momenta that are cleanly accessible, and has facilitated countless novel lattice calculations. Momentum smearing has, however, not been explicitly demonstrated within the framework of distillation. In this work we extend the momentum-smearing idea, by exploring a few modifications to the distillation framework. Together with enhanced time slice sampling and expanded operator bases engendered by distillation, we find ground-state nucleon energies can be extracted reliably for $\\left|\\vec{p}\\right|\\lesssim3\\text{ GeV}$ and matrix elements featuring a large momentum dependence can be resolved.",

Working with SU(3) flavor symmetry, where the up, down and strange quark masses approximately match the physical strange-quark mass giving $m_π\\sim 700$ MeV, we compute finite-volume spectra on six lattice volumes which constrain a scattering system featuring eight coupled channels. Analytically continuing the scattering amplitudes into the complex energy plane, we find a pole singularity corresponding to a narrow resonance which shows relatively weak coupling to the open pseudoscalar--pseudoscalar, vector--pseudoscalar and vector--vector decay channels, but large couplings to at least one kinematically-closed axial-vector--pseudoscalar channel. Attempting a simple extrapolation of the couplings to physical light-quark mass suggests a broad $π_1$ resonance decaying dominantly through the $b_1 π$ mode with much smaller decays into $f_1 π$, $ρπ$, $η' π$ and $ηπ$. A large total width is potentially in agreement with the experimental $π_1(1564)$ candidate state, observed in $ηπ$, $η' π$, which we suggest may be heavily suppressed decay channels.",

The analysis treats the $Λ^*(1520)$ as a stable particle, which is expected to be a reasonable approximation for this narrow resonance. A domain-wall action is used for the light and strange quarks, while the $b$ quark is implemented with an anisotropic clover action with coefficients tuned to produce the correct $B_s$ kinetic mass, rest mass, and hyperfine splitting. We use three different ensembles of lattice gauge-field configurations generated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations, and perform extrapolations of the form factors to the continuum limit and physical pion mass.

Numerical study of this lattice theory has been stymied until recently by both sign problems and the occurrence of lattice artifact phases at strong coupling. We have recently developed a new action that appears capable of solving both problems. The resulting action possesses just $SU(2)$ rather than $U(2)$ gauge symmetry. By explicit computations of the fermion Pfaffian we present evidence that the theory possesses no sign problem and exists in a single phase out to arbitrarily strong coupling. Furthermore, preliminary work shows that the logarithm of the supersymmetric Wilson loop varies as the square root of the 't Hooft coupling $λ$ for large $λ$ in agreement with holographic predictions.",

      "summary": "The fraction of the longitudinal momentum of ${}^3\\text{He}$ that is carried by the isovector combination of $u$ and $d$ quarks is determined using lattice QCD for the first time. The ratio of this combination to that in the constituent nucleons is found to be consistent with unity at the few-percent level from calculations with quark masses corresponding to $m_π\\sim 800$ MeV, extrapolated to the physical quark masses. This constraint is consistent with, and significantly more precise than, determinations from global nuclear parton distribution function fits. Including the lattice QCD determination of the momentum fraction in the nNNPDF global fitting framework results in the uncertainty on the isovector momentum fraction ratio being reduced by a factor of 2.5, and thereby enables a more precise extraction of the $u$ and $d$ parton distributions in ${}^3\\text{He}$.",

The calculation combines finite-volume three-hadron energies, extracted using numerical lattice QCD, with a relativistic finite-volume formalism, required to interpret the results. To fully implement the latter, we also solve integral equations that relate an intermediate three-body K matrix to the physical three-hadron scattering amplitude. The resulting amplitude shows rich analytic structure and a complicated dependence on the two-pion invariant masses, represented here via Dalitz-like plots of the scattering rate.",

This lattice system displays signatures of criticality in gauge observables, without any fine-tuning of couplings and can be studied without Monte Carlo critical slow-down. By coupling exactly massless fermion sources to the lattice gauge model, we demonstrate that non-trivial anomalous dimensions are induced in fermion bilinears depending on the dimensionless electric charge of the fermion. We present a proof-of-principle lattice computation of the Wilson-coefficients of various fermion bilinear three-point functions. Finally, by mapping the charge $q$ of fermion in the model to a flavor $N$ in massless QED$_3$, we point to an universality in low-lying Dirac spectrum and an evidence of self-duality of $N=2$ QED$_3$.",

In this work we use an improved action for $N_f=2$ QCD, based on the Lüscher-Weisz gauge action and clover-improved Wilson fermions with nHYP smeared gauge links. We perform a parameter scan in the region with lattice spacing between $0.066 \\mathop{\\hbox{fm}}$ and $0.115 \\mathop{\\hbox{fm}}$ and pion mass between $207 \\mathop{\\hbox{MeV}}$ and $834 \\mathop{\\hbox{MeV}}$.\n  We determine the lattice spacing and pion mass as a function of the bare coupling parameters ($β$ and $κ$). The results are obtained from twenty-two ensembles on a $24^3\\times 48$ lattice to percent level in statistical accuracy. The finite-volume effects for these ensemble are at the sub-percent level. From these measurements we produce easy-to-use parameterizations to help tune simulations with this action. The lattice spacing is fixed using a mass-independent procedure, by matching observables in the chiral limit. We also provide a parameterization for the chiral extrapolation which is universal and should hold for all discretizations of $N_f=2$ QCD.",

We have investigated several inverse algorithms and studied the pros and cons of each. We show a result with a relatively large momentum transfer ($Q^2 \\sim 4\\, {\\rm GeV^2}$) to suppress the elastic scattering and reveal the contributions from the resonance and inelastic region of the neutrino-nucleon scattering. For elastic scattering, the hadronic tensor is the the product of the elastic form factors for the two corresponding currents.

      "summary": "While the Polyakov loop is an order parameter of the deconfinement transition in the heavy quark mass regime of QCD, its sensitivity to the deconfinement of light, dynamical quarks in QCD is not apparent. On the other hand, the quark mass dependence of the Polyakov loop is sensitive to the appearance of a chiral phase transition. Using lattice QCD calculations in the staggered fermion discretization scheme at finite values of the lattice spacing, $aT = 1/8$, we show here, for the first time, that the Polyakov loop expectation value, and the heavy quark free energy extracted from it, behave like energy-like observables in the vicinity of the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$. Consistent with scaling behavior of energy-like observables in the 3-$d$, O(2) universality class, the quark mass derivatives diverge in the chiral limit at $T_c$ while the temperature derivatives stay finite. The latter will develop a characteristic spike at $T_c$. This, however, may be resolved only in calculations with quark masses being two orders of magnitude smaller than those currently accessible in lattice QCD calculations.",

In this review, the progress of lattice QCD studies of nuclear matrix elements of electroweak currents and beyond-Standard-Model operators is summarized, and connections with effective field theories and nuclear models are outlined.\n  Lattice QCD calculations of nuclear matrix elements can provide guidance for low-energy nuclear reactions in astrophysics, dark matter direct detection experiments, and experimental searches for violations of the symmetries of the Standard Model, including searches for additional CP violation in the hadronic and leptonic sectors, baryon-number violation, and lepton-number or flavor violation. Similarly, important inputs to neutrino experiments seeking to determine the neutrino-mass hierarchy and oscillation parameters, as well as other electroweak and beyond-Standard-Model processes can be determined. The phenomenological implications of existing studies of electroweak and beyond-Standard-Model matrix elements in light nuclear systems are discussed, and future prospects for the field toward precision studies of these matrix elements are outlined.",

In order to be able to differentiate between the former and the latter, a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation is constructed which yields the energy shift of a point-like neutron quadratic in the external field in a derivative expansion, generalizing a long-known result for the dipole electric polarizability due to Foldy. The ten leading Foldy contributions to the energy are determined for a zero-momentum neutron. In addition, eliminating the momentum operator in favor of the velocity operator, analogous results are derived for a zero-velocity neutron. In this case, operator ordering ambiguities are encountered that permit only a determination of eight of the ten Foldy terms.",

Results are obtained for the isovector unpolarized and helicity GPDs. We compute the appropriate matrix elements of fast-moving protons coupled to non-local operators containing a Wilson line. We present results for proton momenta $0.83,\\,1.25,\\,1.67$ GeV, and momentum transfer squared $0.69,\\,1.38$ GeV$^2$. These combinations include cases with zero and nonzero skewness. The calculation is performed using one ensemble of two degenerate mass light, a strange and a charm quark of maximally twisted mass fermions with a clover term. The lattice results are matched to the light-cone GPDs using one-loop perturbation theory within the framework of large momentum effective theory. The final GPDs are given in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme at a scale of 2 GeV.",

      "summary": "The last decade has seen a marked shift in how the internal structure of hadrons is understood. Modern experimental facilities, new theoretical techniques for the continuum bound-state problem and progress with lattice-regularised QCD have provided strong indications that soft quark+quark (diquark) correlations play a crucial role in hadron physics. For example, theory indicates that the appearance of such correlations is a necessary consequence of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, viz. a corollary of emergent hadronic mass that is responsible for almost all visible mass in the universe; experiment has uncovered signals for such correlations in the flavour-separation of the proton's electromagnetic form factors; and phenomenology suggests that diquark correlations might be critical to the formation of exotic tetra- and penta-quark hadrons. A broad spectrum of such information is evaluated herein, with a view to consolidating the facts and therefrom moving toward a coherent, unified picture of hadron structure and the role that diquark correlations might play.",

The lattice size is $48^3\\times96$, which corresponds to a spatial extension of $\\sim5.5$ fm with the lattice spacing $a\\approx 0.114$ fm. For the valence light, strange and charm quarks, we use overlap fermions at several mass points close to their physical values. Our results at the physical point are $f_D=213(5)$ MeV, $f_{D_s}=249(7)$ MeV, $f_{D^*}=234(6)$ MeV, $f_{D_s^*}=274(7)$ MeV, and $f_φ=241(9)$ MeV. The couplings of $D^*$ and $D_s^*$ to the tensor current ($f_V^T$) can be derived, respectively, from the ratios $f_{D^*}^T/f_{D^*}=0.91(4)$ and $f_{D_s^*}^T/f_{D_s^*}=0.92(4)$, which are the first lattice QCD results. We also obtain the ratios $f_{D^*}/f_D=1.10(3)$ and $f_{D_s^*}/f_{D_s}=1.10(4)$, which reflect the size of heavy quark symmetry breaking in charmed mesons. The ratios $f_{D_s}/f_{D}=1.16(3)$ and $f_{D_s^*}/f_{D^*}=1.17(3)$ can be taken as a measure of SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking.",

We introduce a hybrid renormalization procedure to match these lattice correlations to those in the continuum $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme, without introducing extra non-perturbative effects at large $z$. We analyze the effect of ${\\cal O}(Λ_{\\rm QCD})$ ambiguity in the Wilson line self-energy subtraction involved in this hybrid scheme.

In order to reach sub-percent precision, these effects need to be reliably estimated and corrected for, and one of the methods that has been employed for doing this is finite-volume chiral perturbation theory. In this paper, we argue that finite-volume corrections to $a_μ^{\\rm HVP}$ can, in principle, be calculated at any given order in chiral perturbation theory. More precisely, once all low-energy constants needed to define the Effective Field Theory representation of $a_μ^{\\rm HVP}$ in infinite volume are known to a given order, also the finite-volume corrections can be predicted to that order in the chiral expansion.",

This improvement removes a significant numerical bias that had been seen to afflict results of a previous study. In particular, the value obtained for Ji quark orbital angular momentum is reconciled with the one obtained independently via Ji's sum rule, validating the GMTD approach. Since GTMDs simultaneously contain information about the quark impact parameter and transverse momentum, they permit a direct evaluation of the cross product of the latter. They are defined through proton matrix elements of a quark bilocal operator containing a Wilson line; the choice in Wilson line path allows one to continuously interpolate from Ji to Jaffe-Manohar quark orbital angular momentum. The latter is seen to be significantly enhanced in magnitude compared to Ji quark orbital angular momentum, confirming previous results.",

When regulated at short distances with a spatial lattice, this entanglement abruptly vanishes beyond a dimensionless separation, defining a negativity sphere. In two spatial dimensions, we determine this geometric decay constant between a pair of disks and the growth of the negativity sphere toward the continuum through a series of lattice calculations. Making the connection to quantum field theories in three-spatial dimensions, assuming such quantum information scales appear also in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), a new relative scale may be present in effective field theories describing the low-energy dynamics of nucleons and nuclei. We highlight potential impacts of the distillable entanglement structure on effective field theories, lattice QCD calculations and future quantum simulations.",

Using a lattice formulation of leading-order pionless effective field theory, we compute the momentum dependence of the structure factors at finite temperature and at densities beyond the reach of the virial expansion. The Tan contact parameter is computed and the result agrees with the high momentum tail of the vector structure factor. All errors, statistical and systematic, are controlled for. This calculation is a first step towards a model-independent understanding of the linear response of neutron matter at finite temperature, a realm until now little explored.",

      "summary": "Statistical modeling is a key component in the extraction of physical results from lattice field theory calculations. Although the general models used are often strongly motivated by physics, many model variations can frequently be considered for the same lattice data. Model averaging, which amounts to a probability-weighted average over all model variations, can incorporate systematic errors associated with model choice without being overly conservative. We discuss the framework of model averaging from the perspective of Bayesian statistics, and give useful formulae and approximations for the particular case of least-squares fitting, commonly used in modeling lattice results. In addition, we frame the common problem of data subset selection (e.g. choice of minimum and maximum time separation for fitting a two-point correlation function) as a model selection problem and study model averaging as a straightforward alternative to manual selection of fit ranges. Numerical examples involving both mock and real lattice data are given.",

At zero temperature the Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes follow the expectations based on non-relativistic potential models.

The simplification is afforded by using a three-particle quasilocal K matrix that is not fully symmetrized, $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{K}}_{\\rm df,3}^{(u,u)}$, and makes extensive use of time-ordered perturbation theory (TOPT). We obtain a new form of the quantization condition. This new form can then be related algebraically to the standard quantization condition, which depends on a fully symmetric three-particle K matrix, $\\mathcal{K}_{\\rm df,3}$. The new derivation is fully explicit, allowing, for example, a closed-form expression for $\\mathcal{K}_{\\rm df,3}$ to be given in terms of TOPT amplitudes. The new form of the quantization condition is similar in structure to that obtained in the \"finite-volume unitarity\" approach, and in a companion paper we make this connection concrete. Our simplified approach should also allow a more straightforward generalization of the quantization condition to nondegenerate particles, and perhaps also to more than three particles.",

Although the gluon PDF can be obtained from a global fit to experimental data, it is not constrained well in the large-$x$ region. Theoretical gluon-PDF studies are much fewer than those of the quark PDFs. In this work, we present the first lattice-QCD results that access the $x$-dependence of the gluon unpolarized PDF of the nucleon. The lattice calculation is carried out with nucleon momenta up to 2.16 GeV, lattice spacing $a\\approx0.12$ fm, with valence pion masses of 310 and 690 MeV. We use reduced Ioffe-time distributions to cancel the renormalization and implement a one-loop perturbative pseudo-PDF matching to the lightcone distribution. Our matrix element results in coordinate space are consistent with those obtained from the global PDF fits of CT18 NNLO and NNPDF3.1 NNLO. Our fitted gluon PDF extrapolated to the physical pion mass gives consistent results in the $x > 0.3$ region.",

      "summary": "Two-neutrino double-beta decay of certain nuclear isotopes is one of the rarest Standard Model processes observed in nature. Its neutrinoless counterpart is an exotic lepton-number nonconserving process that is widely searched for to determine if the neutrinos are Majorana fermions. In order to connect the rate of these processes to the Standard Model and beyond the Standard Model interactions, it is essential that the corresponding nuclear matrix elements are constrained reliably from theory. Lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) and low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) are expected to play an essential role in constraining the matrix element of the two-nucleon subprocess, which could in turn provide the input into ab initio nuclear-structure calculations in larger isotopes. Focusing on the two-neutrino process $nn \\to pp \\, (ee \\barν_e\\barν_e)$, the amplitude is constructed in this work in pionless EFT at next-to-leading order, demonstrating the emergence of a renormalization-scale independent amplitude and the absence of any new low-energy constant at this order beyond those present in the single-weak process. Most importantly, it is shown how a LQCD four-point correlation function in Euclidean and finite-volume spacetime can be used to constrain the Minkowski infinite-volume amplitude in the EFT. The same formalism is provided for the related single-weak process, which is an input to the double-$β$ decay formalism. The LQCD-EFT matching procedure outlined for the double-weak amplitude paves the road toward constraining the two-nucleon matrix element entering the neutrinoless double-beta decay amplitude with a light Majorana neutrino.",

      "summary": "The strangeonium-like $s\\bar{s}g$ hybrids are investigated from lattice QCD in the quenched approximation. In the Coulomb gauge, spatially extended operators are constructed for $1^{--}$ and $(0,1,2)^{-+}$ states with the color octet $s\\bar{s}$ component being separated from the chromomagnetic field strength by spatial distances $r$, whose matrix elements between the vacuum and the corresponding states are interpreted as Bethe-Salpeter (BS) wave functions. In each of the $(1,2)^{-+}$ channels, the masses and the BS wave functions are reliably derived. The $1^{-+}$ ground state mass is around 2.1-2.2 GeV, and that of $2^{-+}$ is around 2.3-2.4 GeV, while the masses of the first excited states are roughly 1.4 GeV higher. This mass splitting is much larger than the expectation of the phenomenological flux-tube model or constituent gluon model for hybrids, which is usually a few hundred MeV. The BS wave functions with respect to $r$ show clear radial nodal structures of non-relativistic two-body system, which imply that $r$ is a meaningful dynamical variable for these hybrids and motivate a color halo picture of hybrids that the color octet $s\\bar{s}$ is surrounded by gluonic degrees of freedom. In the $1^{--}$ channel, the properties of the lowest two states comply with those of $φ(1020)$ and $φ(1680)$. We have not obtained convincing information relevant to $φ(2170)$ yet, however, we argue that whether $φ(2170)$ is a conventional $s\\bar{s}$ meson or a $s\\bar{s}g$ hybrid within the color halo scenario, the ratio of partial decay widths $Γ(φη)$ and $Γ(φη')$ observed by BESIII can be understood by the mechanism of hadronic transition of a strangeonium-like meson along with the $η-η'$ mixing.",

Using a multilevel algorithm and tree-level improvement, we study the behavior of the diffusion coefficient as a function of temperature in the wide range $1.1 < T / T_c < 10^4$ in order to compare it to perturbative expansions at high temperature. We find that within errors the lattice results are remarkably compatible with the next-to-leading order perturbative result.",

      "summary": "We present the first lattice QCD determination of the $B_c \\rightarrow J/ψ$ vector and axial-vector form factors. These will enable experimental information on the rate for $B_c$ semileptonic decays to $J/ψ$ to be converted into a value for $V_{cb}$. Our calculation covers the full physical $q^2$ range of the decay and uses non-perturbatively renormalised lattice currents. We use the Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) action for all valence quarks on the second generation MILC ensembles of gluon field configurations including $u$, $d$, $s$ and $c$ HISQ sea quarks. Our HISQ heavy quarks have masses ranging upwards from that of $c$; we are able to reach that of the $b$ on our finest lattices. This enables us to map out the dependence on heavy quark mass and determine results in the continuum limit at the $b$. We use our form factors to construct the differential rates for $B_c^- \\rightarrow J/ψμ^- \\barν_μ$ and obtain a total rate with $7\\%$ uncertainty: $Γ(B_c^-\\rightarrow J/ψμ^-\\barν_μ)/|η_{\\mathrm{EW}}V_{cb}|^2 = 1.73(12)\\times 10^{13} ~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Including values for $V_{cb}$, $η_{\\mathrm{EW}}$ and $τ_{B_c}$ yields a branching fraction for this decay mode of 0.0150(11)(10)(3) ~with uncertainties from lattice QCD, $η_\\mathrm{EW}V_{cb}$ and $τ_{B_c}$ respectively.",

Familiar theories of partons are QCD light-front quantization and soft-collinear effective theory, both of which are intrinsically Minkowskian and appear unsuitable for classical Monte Carlo simulations. A ``new'' form of the parton theory has been formulated in term of the old-fashioned, Feynman's infinite momentum frame, in which the parton degrees of freedom are filtered through infinite-momentum external states. The partonic structure of hadrons is then related to the matrix elements of static (equal-time) correlators in the state $|P^z=\\infty\\rangle$. This representation lays the foundation of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) which approximates parton physics through a systematic $M/P^z$ expansion of the lattice QCD matrix elements at a finite but large momentum $P^z$, and removes the residual logarithmic-$P^z$ dependence by the standard effective-field-theory matching and running.",

Our analyses use both RI-MOM and ratio-based schemes to renormalize the equal-time bi-local quark-bilinear matrix elements of pions boosted up to 2.4 GeV momenta.

The decay-mode dependent scalar form factor is the only necessary theoretical ingredient for the relations. Otherwise, they combine measurable decay rates as a function of the invariant mass-squared of the lepton pair $q^2$ in such a way that a universal decay-mode independent function is found for decays to vector and pseudoscalar mesons, respectively. This can be applied to the decays $B\\rightarrow D^{*}τν$, $B_s\\rightarrow D_s^*τν$, $B_c\\rightarrow J/ψτν$ and $B\\rightarrow Dτν$, $B_s\\rightarrow D_sτν$, $B_c\\rightarrow η_cτν$, with implications for $R(D^{(*)})$, $R(D_s^{(*)})$, $R(J/ψ)$, $R(η_c)$, and $\\mathcal{B}(B_c\\rightarrow τν)$.

It is used in all branches of Physics, from QCD/nuclear physics to the correlated electron systems. However, many systems of great importance (dense matter inside neutron stars, the repulsive Hubbard model away from half-filling, dynamical and non-equilibrium observables) are not amenable to the Monte Carlo method as it currently stands due to the so-called \"sign-problem\". We review a new set of ideas recently developed to tackle the sign problem based on the complexification of field space and the Picard-Lefshetz theory accompanying it. The mathematical ideas underpinning this approach, as well as the algorithms so far developed, are described together with non-trivial examples where the method has already been proved successful. Directions of future work, including the burgeoning use of machine learning techniques, are delineated.",

The next stage of the scheme is able to overwrite these values. The result is proven for a 3-stage third order method and a conjecture for higher order methods is formulated.

      "summary": "Composite Higgs models must exhibit very different dynamics from quantum chromodynamics (QCD) regardless whether they describe the Higgs boson as a dilatonlike state or a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson. Large separation of scales and large anomalous dimensions are frequently desired by phenomenological models. Mass-split systems are well-suited for composite Higgs models because they are governed by a conformal fixed point in the ultraviolet but are chirally broken in the infrared. In this work we use lattice field theory calculations with domain wall fermions to investigate a system with four light and six heavy flavors. We demonstrate how a nearby conformal fixed point affects the properties of the four light flavors that exhibit chiral symmetry breaking in the infrared. Specifically we describe hyperscaling of dimensionful physical quantities and determine the corresponding anomalous mass dimension. We obtain $y_m=1+γ^*= 1.47(5)$ suggesting that $N_f=10$ lies inside the conformal window. Comparing the low energy spectrum to predictions of dilaton chiral perturbation theory, we observe excellent agreement which supports the expectation that the 4+6 mass-split system exhibits near-conformal dynamics with a relatively light $0^{++}$ isosinglet scalar.",

      "title": "The role of boundary conditions in quantum computations of scattering observables",
      "summary": "Quantum computing may offer the opportunity to simulate strongly-interacting field theories, such as quantum chromodynamics, with physical time evolution. This would give access to Minkowski-signature correlators, in contrast to the Euclidean calculations routinely performed at present. However, as with present-day calculations, quantum computation strategies still require the restriction to a finite system size, including a finite, usually periodic, spatial volume. In this work, we investigate the consequences of this in the extraction of hadronic and Compton-like scattering amplitudes. Using the framework presented in Phys. Rev. D101 014509 (2020), we quantify the volume effects for various $1+1$D Minkowski-signature quantities and show that these can be a significant source of systematic uncertainty, even for volumes that are very large by the standards of present-day Euclidean calculations. We then present an improvement strategy, based in the fact that the finite volume has a reduced symmetry. This implies that kinematic points, which yield the same Lorentz invariants, may still be physically distinct in the finite-volume system. As we demonstrate, both numerically and analytically, averaging over such sets can significantly suppress the unwanted volume distortions and improve the extraction of the physical scattering amplitudes.",

      "summary": "We use non-perturbative lattice calculations to investigate the finite-temperature confinement transition of stealth dark matter, focusing on the regime in which this early-universe transition is first order and would generate a stochastic background of gravitational waves. Stealth dark matter extends the standard model with a new strongly coupled SU(4) gauge sector with four massive fermions in the fundamental representation, producing a stable spin-0 'dark baryon' as a viable composite dark matter candidate. Future searches for stochastic gravitational waves will provide a new way to discover or constrain stealth dark matter, in addition to previously investigated direct-detection and collider experiments. As a first step to enabling this phenomenology, we determine how heavy the dark fermions need to be in order to produce a first-order stealth dark matter confinement transition.",

      "summary": "We perform a lattice QCD calculation of the hadronic light-by-light contribution to $(g-2)_μ$ at the SU(3) flavor-symmetric point $m_π=m_K\\simeq 420\\,$MeV. The representation used is based on coordinate-space perturbation theory, with all QED elements of the relevant Feynman diagrams implemented in continuum, infinite Euclidean space. As a consequence, the effect of using finite lattices to evaluate the QCD four-point function of the electromagnetic current is exponentially suppressed. Thanks to the SU(3)-flavor symmetry, only two topologies of diagrams contribute, the fully connected and the leading disconnected. We show the equivalence in the continuum limit of two methods of computing the connected contribution, and introduce a sparse-grid technique for computing the disconnected contribution. Thanks to our previous calculation of the pion transition form factor, we are able to correct for the residual finite-size effects and extend the tail of the integrand. We test our understanding of finite-size effects by using gauge ensembles differing only by their volume. After a continuum extrapolation based on four lattice spacings, we obtain $a_μ^{\\rm hlbl} = (65.4\\pm 4.9 \\pm 6.6)\\times 10^{-11}$, where the first error results from the uncertainties on the individual gauge ensembles and the second is the systematic error of the continuum extrapolation. Finally, we estimate how this value will change as the light-quark masses are lowered to their physical values.",

In a paper by the NuQS collaboration, the proposal is made to simulate such field theories on a quantum computer using the universal properties of a similar model. In this paper, following that direction, we demonstrate how to prepare the ground state of the model from and measure a dynamical quantity of interest, the O(3) Noether charge, on a quantum computer. In particular, we apply Trotter methods to obtain results for the complexity of adiabatic ground state preparation in both the weak-coupling and quantum-critical regimes and use shadow tomography to measure the dynamics of local observables. We then present and analyze a quantum algorithm based on non-unitary randomized simulation methods that may yield an approach suitable for intermediate-term noisy quantum devices.",

Several different parametrizations for the energy dependence of the $K$-matrix are considered. We also determine the positions of the nearest poles in the scattering amplitudes, which correspond to the broad $κ$ resonance in the $S$-wave and the narrow $K^*(892)$ resonance in the $P$-wave. Our calculations are performed with $2+1$ dynamical clover fermions for two different pion masses of $317.2(2.2)$ and $175.9(1.8)$ MeV. Our preferred $S$-wave parametrization is based on a conformal map and includes an Adler zero; for the $P$-wave we use a standard pole parametrization including Blatt-Weisskopf barrier factors.

      "summary": "The strong force which binds hadrons is described by the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Determining the character and manifestations of QCD is one of the most important and challenging outstanding issues necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the structure of hadrons. Within the context of the QCD parton picture, the Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) have been remarkably successful in describing a wide variety of processes. However, these PDFs have generally been confined to the description of collinear partons within the hadron. New experiments and facilities provide the opportunity to additionally explore the transverse structure of hadrons which is described by Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) and Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions (TMD PDFs). In our previous review, we compared and contrasted the two main approaches used to determine the collinear PDFs: the first based on perturbative QCD factorization theorems, and the second based on lattice QCD calculations. In the present report, we provide an update of recent progress on the collinear PDFs, and also expand the scope to encompass the generalized PDFs (GPDs and TMD PDFs). We review the current state of the various calculations, and consider what new data might be available in the near future. We also examine how a shared effort can foster dialog between the PDF and Lattice QCD communities, and yield improvements for these generalized PDFs.",

      "title": "Challenges in Semileptonic B Decays",
      "summary": "Two of the elements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix, $|V_{ub}|$ and $|V_{cb}|$, are extracted from semileptonic B decays. The results of the B factories, analysed in the light of the most recent theoretical calculations, remain puzzling, because for both $|V_{ub}|$ and $|V_{cb}|$ the exclusive and inclusive determinations are in clear tension. Further, measurements in the $τ$ channels at Belle, Babar, and LHCb show discrepancies with the Standard Model predictions, pointing to a possible violation of lepton flavor universality. LHCb and Belle II have the potential to resolve these issues in the next few years. This article summarizes the discussions and results obtained at the MITP workshop held on April 9--13, 2018, in Mainz, Germany, with the goal to develop a medium-term strategy of analyses and calculations aimed at solving the puzzles. Lattice and continuum theorists working together with experimentalists have discussed how to reshape the semileptonic analyses in view of the much higher luminosity expected at Belle II, searching for ways to systematically validate the theoretical predictions in both exclusive and inclusive B decays, and to exploit the rich possibilities at LHCb.",

      "title": "The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in the Standard Model",
      "summary": "We review the present status of the Standard Model calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. This is performed in a perturbative expansion in the fine-structure constant $α$ and is broken down into pure QED, electroweak, and hadronic contributions. The pure QED contribution is by far the largest and has been evaluated up to and including $\\mathcal{O}(α^5)$ with negligible numerical uncertainty. The electroweak contribution is suppressed by $(m_μ/M_W)^2$ and only shows up at the level of the seventh significant digit. It has been evaluated up to two loops and is known to better than one percent. Hadronic contributions are the most difficult to calculate and are responsible for almost all of the theoretical uncertainty. The leading hadronic contribution appears at $\\mathcal{O}(α^2)$ and is due to hadronic vacuum polarization, whereas at $\\mathcal{O}(α^3)$ the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution appears. Given the low characteristic scale of this observable, these contributions have to be calculated with nonperturbative methods, in particular, dispersion relations and the lattice approach to QCD. The largest part of this review is dedicated to a detailed account of recent efforts to improve the calculation of these two contributions with either a data-driven, dispersive approach, or a first-principle, lattice-QCD approach. The final result reads $a_μ^\\text{SM}=116\\,591\\,810(43)\\times 10^{-11}$ and is smaller than the Brookhaven measurement by 3.7$σ$. The experimental uncertainty will soon be reduced by up to a factor four by the new experiment currently running at Fermilab, and also by the future J-PARC experiment. This and the prospects to further reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the near future-which are also discussed here-make this quantity one of the most promising places to look for evidence of new physics.",

      "summary": "We present a lattice-QCD calculation of the pion, kaon and $η_s$ distribution amplitudes using large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). Our calculation is carried out using three ensembles with 2+1+1 flavors of highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ), generated by MILC collaboration, at 310 MeV pion mass with 0.06, 0.09 and 0.12 fm lattice spacings. We use clover fermion action for the valence quarks and tune the quark mass to match the lightest light and strange masses in the sea. The resulting lattice matrix elements are nonperturbatively renormalized in regularization-independent momentum-subtraction (RI/MOM) scheme and extrapolated to the continuum. We use two approaches to extract the $x$-dependence of the meson distribution amplitudes: 1) we fit the renormalized matrix elements in coordinate space to an assumed distribution form through a one-loop matching kernel; 2) we use a machine-learning algorithm trained on pseudo lattice-QCD data to make predictions on the lattice data. We found the results are consistent between these methods with the latter method giving a less smooth shape. Both approaches suggest that as the quark mass increases, the distribution amplitude becomes narrower. Our pion distribution amplitude has broader distribution than predicted by light-front constituent-quark model, and the moments of our pion distributions agree with previous lattice-QCD results using the operator production expansion.",

The correlation functions are calculated using the Wilson-Clover action and the renormalization of the three operators is carried out nonperturbatively on the lattice in the RI${}^\\prime$-MOM scheme. The data have been collected at lattice spacings $a \\approx 0.15,\\ 0.12,\\ 0.09,$ and 0.06 fm and $M_π\\approx 310,\\ 220$ and 135 MeV, which are used to obtain the physical values using a simultaneous chiral-continuum-finite-volume fit. The final results, in the $\\overline{MS}$ scheme at 2 GeV, are $\\langle x \\rangle_{u-d} = 0.173(14)(07)$, $\\langle x \\rangle_{Δu-Δd} = 0.213(15)(22)$ and $\\langle x \\rangle_{δu-δd} = 0.208(19)(24)$, where the first error is the overall analysis uncertainty and the second is an additional systematic uncertainty due to possible residual excited-state contributions. These results are consistent with other recent lattice calculations and phenomenological global fit values.",

In this work, we address, for the first time, the one-loop matching for the twist-3 parton distribution function $g_T(x)$. The results have been obtained using three different infrared regulators, while dimensional regularization has been adopted to deal with the ultraviolet divergences. We present the renormalized expressions of the matching coefficient for $g_{T}(x)$ in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ and modified $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ schemes. We also discuss the role played by a zero-mode contribution. Our results have already been used for the extraction of $g_T(x)$ from lattice QCD calculations.",

We introduce a new chirality operator $[γ_5 \\otimes 1]$ and a new shift operator $[1 \\otimes ξ_5]$, which respect the same recursion relation as the $γ_5$ operator in the continuum. Then we show that matrix elements of the chirality operator sandwiched between two eigenstates of the staggered Dirac operator are related to those of the shift operator by the Ward identity of the conserved $U(1)_A$ symmetry of staggered fermion actions. We perform a numerical study in quenched QCD using HYP staggered quarks to demonstrate the Ward identity. We introduce a new concept of leakage patterns which collectively represent the matrix elements of the chirality operator and the shift operator sandwiched between two eigenstates of the staggered Dirac operator. The leakage pattern provides a new method to identify zero modes and non-zero modes in the Dirac eigenvalue spectrum. This method is as robust as the spectral flow method but requires much less computing power. Analysis using a machine learning technique confirms that the leakage pattern is universal, since the staggered Dirac eigenmodes on normal gauge configurations respect it. In addition, the leakage pattern can be used to determine a ratio of renormalization factors as a by-product. We conclude that it might be possible and realistic to measure the topological charge $Q$ using the Atiya-Singer index theorem and the leakage pattern of the chirality operator in the staggered fermion formalism.",

The calculation is performed with five values of the pion mass ranging from $130 \\lesssim m_π\\lesssim 400$ MeV, four lattice spacings of $a\\sim 0.15, 0.12, 0.09$ and $0.06$ fm and multiple values of the lattice volume. The interpolation/extrapolation to the physical pion and kaon mass point, the continuum, and infinite volume limits are performed with a variety of different extrapolation functions utilizing both the relevant mixed-action effective field theory expressions as well as discretization-enhanced continuum chiral perturbation theory formulas. We find that the $a\\sim0.06$ fm ensemble is helpful, but not necessary to achieve a subpercent determination of $F_K/F_π$. We also include an estimate of the strong isospin breaking corrections and arrive at a final result of $F_{K^\\pm}/F_{π^\\pm} = 1.1942(45)$ with all sources of statistical and systematic uncertainty included. This is consistent with the Flavour Lattice Averaging Group average value, providing an important benchmark for our lattice action. Combining our result with experimental measurements of the pion and kaon leptonic decays leads to a determination of $|V_{us}|/|V_{ud}| = 0.2311(10)$.",

      "summary": "Measurements of a permanent neutron electric dipole moment (EDM) potentially probe Beyond-the-Standard Model (BSM) sources of CP-violation. At low energy the CP-violating BSM interactions are parametrized by flavor-conserving CP-violating operators of dimension higher than four. QCD calculations of the nucleon matrix elements of these operators are required to fully reconstruct the sources and magnitudes of the different CP-violating contributions to the nucleon EDM. Herein we study the quark-chromo electric dipole moment (qCEDM) operator and the three-gluon Weinberg operator. The non-perturbative determination, using lattice QCD, of the nucleon matrix elements of these CP-violating operators is hampered by their short-distance behavior. Under renormalization these operators mix with lower dimensional operators, which induces power divergences in the lattice spacing, as the continuum limit is approached. We study the short-distance behavior of the qCEDM and the Weinberg operators using the gradient flow. We perform a short flow time expansion and determine, in perturbation theory, the expansion coefficients of the linearly-divergent terms stemming from the mixing with the pseudoscalar density and the topological charge, confirming the expectations of the operator product expansion. We introduce a new method to perform calculations at non-zero flow-time for arbitrary values of the external momenta. This method allows us to work in four dimensions for most of the calculations described in this paper, avoiding the complications associated with defining $γ_5$ in generic d dimensions. We show that leading contributions in the external momenta can be reproduced by defining $γ_5$ using the 't Hooft-Veltman-Breitenlohner-Maison scheme.",

      "summary": "An approach is given for solving large linear systems that combines Krylov methods with use of two different grid levels. Eigenvectors are computed on the coarse grid and used to deflate eigenvalues on the fine grid. GMRES-type methods are first used on both the coarse and fine grids. Then another approach is given that has a restarted BiCGStab (or IDR) method on the fine grid. While BiCGStab is generally considered to be a non-restarted method, it works well in this context with deflating and restarting. Tests show this new approach can be very efficient for difficult linear equations problems.",

      "title": "Flavor non-singlet parton distribution functions from lattice QCD at physical quark masses via the pseudo-distribution approach",
      "summary": "One of the great challenges of QCD is to determine the partonic structure of the nucleon from first principles. In this work, we provide such a determination of the flavor non-singlet ($u-d$) unpolarized parton distribution function (PDF), utilizing the non-perturbative formulation of QCD on the lattice. We apply Radyushkin's pseudo-distribution approach to lattice results obtained using simulations with the light quark mass fixed to its physical value; this is the first ever attempt for this approach directly at the physical point. The extracted coordinate-space matrix elements are used to find the relevant physical Ioffe time distributions from a matching procedure. The full Bjorken-$x$ dependence of PDFs is resolved using several reconstruction methods to tackle the ill-conditioned inverse problem encountered when using discrete lattice data. We consider both the valence distribution $q_v$ and the combination with antiquarks $q_v+2\\bar{q}$, related to, respectively, the real and imaginary part of extracted matrix elements. Good agreement is found with PDFs from global fits already within statistical uncertainties and it is further improved by quantifying several systematic effects. The results presented here are the first ever \\emph{ab initio} determinations of PDFs fully consistent with global fits in the whole $x$-range. Thus, they pave the way to investigating a wider class of partonic distributions, such as e.g.\\ singlet PDFs and generalized parton distributions. Therefore, essential and yet missing first-principle insights can be achieved, complementing the rich experimental programs dedicated to the structure of the nucleon.",

      "summary": "Current measurements of the high energy behavior of the pion form factor are obtained from pion electroproduction data. These values are model dependent, utilizing the Vanderhaeghen, Guidal and Laget Regge (VGL) Model for their extraction. Recent work which examined the implementation of gauge invariance in that model suggested that it might lead to extracted pion form factors larger than the true values. Here we introduce a new model which preserves the successes of the VGL Model but implements gauge invariance in a new way. To demonstrate the validity of this new approach, we first use it to extract the pion form factor in a simple toy model. When compared with the previous extraction method, the improved model leads to a more reliable extraction. The success in this simple model leads us to reanalyse the electroproduction cross section data, where we obtain comparable values for the pion form factor to those obtained using the VGL procedure.",

We compare our lattice results with the matrix elements obtained from matching the PDFs from CT18NNLO and NNPDF3.1NNLO global fits.

We construct spin-dependent quasi-TMDPDFs that are amenable to lattice QCD calculations and that can be used to determine spin-dependent TMDPDFs. We calculate the short-distance coefficients connecting spin-dependent TMDPDFs and quasi-TMDPDFs at one-loop order. We find that the helicity and transversity distributions have the same coefficient as the unpolarized TMDPDF. We also argue that the same is true for pretzelosity and that this spin universality of the matching will hold to all orders in $α_s$. Thus, it is possible to calculate ratios of these distributions as a function of longitudinal momentum and transverse position utilizing simpler Wilson line paths than have previously been considered.",

Both calculations were performed with physical kinematics on a $32^3\\times 64$ lattice with an inverse lattice spacing of $a^{-1}=1.3784(68)$ GeV. However, the current calculation includes nearly four times the statistics and numerous technical improvements allowing us to more reliably isolate the $ππ$ ground-state and more accurately relate the lattice operators to those defined in the Standard Model. We find ${\\rm Re}(A_0)=2.99(0.32)(0.59)\\times 10^{-7}$ GeV and ${\\rm Im}(A_0)=-6.98(0.62)(1.44)\\times 10^{-11}$ GeV, where the errors are statistical and systematic, respectively. The former agrees well with the experimental result ${\\rm Re}(A_0)=3.3201(18)\\times 10^{-7}$ GeV. These results for $A_0$ can be combined with our earlier lattice calculation of $A_2$ to obtain ${\\rm Re}(\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon)=21.7(2.6)(6.2)(5.0) \\times 10^{-4}$, where the third error represents omitted isospin breaking effects, and Re$(A_0)$/Re$(A_2) = 19.9(2.3)(4.4)$. The first agrees well with the experimental result of ${\\rm Re}(\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon)=16.6(2.3)\\times 10^{-4}$. A comparison of the second with the observed ratio Re$(A_0)/$Re$(A_2) = 22.45(6)$, demonstrates the Standard Model origin of this \"$ΔI = 1/2$ rule\" enhancement.",

We propose a new multi-grid approach for chiral fermions, applicable to both the 5-d domain wall or 4-d Overlap operator. The central idea is to directly coarsen the 4-d Wilson kernel, giving an effective domain wall or overlap operator on each level. We provide here an explicit construction for the Shamir domain wall formulation with numerical tests for the 2-d Schwinger prototype, demonstrating near ideal multi-grid scaling. The framework is designed for a natural extension to 4-d lattice QCD chiral fermions, such as the Möbius, Zolotarev or Borici domain wall discretizations or directly to a rational expansion of the 4-d Overlap operator. For the Shamir operator, the effective overlap operator is isolated by the use of a Pauli-Villars preconditioner in the spirit of the Kähler-Dirac spectral map used in a recent staggered MG algorithm [1].",

We use an ensemble of gauge configurations with two degenerate light, a strange and a charm quark ($N_f=2+1+1$) of maximally twisted mass fermions with a clover improvement. The lattice has a spatial extent of 3~fm, lattice spacing of 0.093~fm, and reproduces a pion mass of $260$ MeV. We use the quasi-distribution approach and employ three values of the proton momentum boost, 0.83 GeV, 1.25 GeV, and 1.67 GeV. We use a source-sink separation of 1.12~fm to suppress excited-states contamination. The lattice data are renormalized non-perturbatively. We calculate the matching equation within Large Momentum Effective Theory, which is applied to the lattice data in order to obtain $g_T$. The final distribution is presented in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme at a scale of 2 GeV. We also calculate the helicity distribution $g_1$ to test the Wandzura-Wilczek approximation for $g_T$. We find that the approximation works well for a broad range of $x$. This work demonstrates the feasibility of accessing twist-3 parton distribution functions from novel methods within lattice QCD and can provide essential insights into the structure of hadrons.",

      "title": "Large-Momentum Effective Theory",
      "summary": "Since the parton model was introduced by Feynman more than fifty years ago, we have learned much about the partonic structure of the proton through a large body of high-energy experimental data and dedicated global fits. However, calculating the partonic observables such as parton distribution function (PDFs) from the fundamental theory of strong interactions, QCD, has made limited progress. Recently, the authors have advocated a formalism, large-momentum effective theory (LaMET), through which one can extract parton physics from the properties of the proton travelling at a moderate boost-factor, e.g., $γ\\sim (2-5)$. The key observation behind this approach is that Lorentz symmetry allows the standard formalism of partons in terms of light-front operators to be replaced by an equivalent one with large-momentum states and time-independent operators of a universality class. With LaMET, the PDFs, generalized PDFs or GPDs, transverse-momentum-dependent PDFs, and light-front wave functions can all be extracted in principle from lattice simulations of QCD (or other non-perturbative methods) through standard effective field theory matching and running. Future lattice QCD calculations with exa-scale computational facilities can help to understand the experimental data related to the hadronic structure, including those from the upcoming Electron-Ion Colliders dedicated to exploring the partonic landscape of the proton. Here we review the progress made in the past few years in development of the LaMET formalism and its applications, particularly on the demonstration of its effectiveness from initial lattice QCD simulations.",

In [arXiv:1705.06097], we defined for a given Markov stochastic process \"the distance between configurations,\" which enumerates the difficulty of transition between configurations. In this article, we consider stochastic processes of large-$N$ matrix models, where we regard the eigenvalues as spacetime coordinates. We investigate the distance for the effective stochastic process of one-eigenvalue, and argue that this distance can be interpreted in noncritical string theory as probing a classical geometry with a D-instanton. We further give an evidence that, when we apply our formalism to a tempered stochastic process of $U(N)$ matrix, where the 't Hooft coupling is treated as another dynamical variable, a Euclidean AdS$_2$ geometry emerges in the extended configuration space in the large-$N$ limit, and the horizon corresponds to the Gross-Witten-Wadia phase transition point.",

      "summary": "Non-zero topological charge is prohibited in the chiral limit of gauge-fermion systems because any instanton would create a zero mode of the Dirac operator. On the lattice, however, the geometric $Q_\\text{geom}=\\langle F{\\tilde F}\\rangle /32π^2$ definition of the topological charge does not necessarily vanish even when the gauge fields are smoothed for example with gradient flow. Small vacuum fluctuations (dislocations) not seen by the fermions may be promoted to instanton-like objects by the gradient flow. We demonstrate that these artifacts of the flow cause the gradient flow renormalized gauge coupling to increase and run faster. In step-scaling studies such artifacts contribute a term which increases with volume. The usual $a/L\\to 0$ continuum limit extrapolations can hence lead to incorrect results. In this paper we investigate these topological lattice artifacts in the SU(3) 10-flavor system with domain wall fermions and the 8-flavor system with staggered fermions. Both systems exhibit nonzero topological charge at the strong coupling, especially when using Symanzik gradient flow. We demonstrate how this artifact impacts the determination of the renormalized gauge coupling and the step-scaling $β$ function.",

We present a detailed analysis including the study of systematic effects of our extensive data set generated with ten dynamical flavors using the Symanzik gauge action and three times stout smeared Möbius domain wall fermions. Using up to $32^4$ volumes, we calculate renormalized couplings for different gradient flow schemes and determine the step-scaling $β$ function for a scale change $s=2$ on up to five different lattice volume pairs. In an accompanying paper we discuss that gradient flow can promote lattice dislocations to instanton-like objects, introducing nonperturbative lattice artifacts to the step scaling function. Motivated by the observation that Wilson flow sufficiently suppresses these artifacts, we choose Wilson flow with the Symanzik operator as our preferred analysis. We study systematic effects by calculating the step-scaling function based on alternative flows (Zeuthen or Symanzik), alternative operators (Wilson plaquette, clover), and also explore the effects of the perturbative tree-level improvement. Further we investigate the effects due to the finite value of $L_s$.",

      "summary": "We show that standard identities and theorems for lattice models with $U(1)$ symmetry get re-expressed discretely in the tensorial formulation of these models. We explain the geometrical analogy between the continuous lattice equations of motion and the discrete selection rules of the tensors. We construct a gauge-invariant transfer matrix in arbitrary dimensions. We show the equivalence with its gauge-fixed version in a maximal temporal gauge and explain how a discrete Gauss's law is always enforced. We propose a noise-robust way to implement Gauss's law in arbitrary dimensions. We reformulate Noether's theorem for global, local, continuous or discrete Abelian symmetries: for each given symmetry, there is one corresponding tensor redundancy. We discuss semi-classical approximations for classical solutions with periodic boundary conditions in two solvable cases. We show the correspondence of their weak coupling limit with the tensor formulation after Poisson summation. We briefly discuss connections with other approaches and implications for quantum computing.",

      "title": "Generalizing the relativistic quantization condition to include all three-pion isospin channels",
      "summary": "We present a generalization of the relativistic, finite-volume, three-particle quantization condition for non-identical pions in isosymmetric QCD. The resulting formalism allows one to use discrete finite-volume energies, determined using lattice QCD, to constrain scattering amplitudes for all possible values of two- and three-pion isospin. As for the case of identical pions considered previously, the result splits into two steps: The first defines a non-perturbative function with roots equal to the allowed energies, $E_n(L)$, in a given cubic volume with side-length $L$. This function depends on an intermediate three-body quantity, denoted $\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathrm{df},3}$, which can thus be constrained from lattice QCD input. The second step is a set of integral equations relating $\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathrm{df},3}$ to the physical scattering amplitude, $\\mathcal M_3$. Both of the key relations, $E_n(L) \\leftrightarrow \\mathcal{K}_{\\mathrm{df},3}$ and $\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathrm{df},3}\\leftrightarrow \\mathcal M_3$, are shown to be block-diagonal in the basis of definite three-pion isospin, $I_{πππ}$, so that one in fact recovers four independent relations, corresponding to $I_{πππ}=0,1,2,3$. We also provide the generalized threshold expansion of $\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathrm{df},3}$ for all channels, as well as parameterizations for all three-pion resonances present for $I_{πππ}=0$ and $I_{πππ}=1$. As an example of the utility of the generalized formalism, we present a toy implementation of the quantization condition for $I_{πππ}=0$, focusing on the quantum numbers of the $ω$ and $h_1$ resonances.",

      "title": "Lattice QCD Inputs for Nuclear Double Beta Decay",
      "summary": "Second order beta-decay processes with and without neutrinos in the final state are key probes of nuclear physics and of the nature of neutrinos. Neutrinoful double-beta decay is the rarest Standard Model process that has been observed and provides a unique test of the understanding of weak nuclear interactions. Observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay would reveal that neutrinos are Majorana fermions and that lepton number conservation is violated in nature. While significant progress has been made in phenomenological approaches to understanding these processes, establishing a connection between these processes and the physics of the Standard Model and beyond is a critical task as it will provide input into the design and interpretation of future experiments. The strong-interaction contributions to double-beta decay processes are non-perturbative and can only be addressed systematically through a combination of lattice Quantum Chromoodynamics (LQCD) and nuclear many-body calculations. In this review, current efforts to establish the LQCD connection are discussed for both neutrinoful and neutrinoless double-beta decay. LQCD calculations of the hadronic contributions to the neutrinoful process $nn\\to pp e^- e^- \\barν_e\\barν_e$ and to various neutrinoless pionic transitions are reviewed, and the connections of these calculations to the phenomenology of double-beta decay through the use of effective field theory (EFTs) is highlighted. At present, LQCD calculations are limited to small nuclear systems, and to pionic subsystems, and require matching to appropriate EFTs to have direct phenomenological impact. However, these calculations have already revealed qualitatively that there are terms in the EFTs that can only be constrained from double-beta decay processes themselves or using inputs from LQCD. Future prospects for direct calculations in larger nuclei are also discussed.",

We show that noise arising from complex phase fluctuations of observables can be reduced without introducing bias using path integral contour deformation techniques. A numerical study of contour deformations for correlation functions in Abelian gauge theory and complex scalar field theory demonstrates that variance can be reduced by orders of magnitude without modifying Monte Carlo sampling.",

      "title": "Consistency of hadronic vacuum polarization between lattice QCD and the R-ratio",
      "summary": "There are emerging tensions for theory results of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment both within recent lattice QCD calculations and between some lattice QCD calculations and R-ratio results. In this paper we work towards scrutinizing critical aspects of these calculations. We focus in particular on a precise calculation of Euclidean position-space windows defined by RBC/UKQCD that are ideal quantities for cross-checks within the lattice community and with R-ratio results. We perform a lattice QCD calculation using physical up, down, strange, and charm sea quark gauge ensembles generated in the staggered formalism by the MILC collaboration. We study the continuum limit using inverse lattice spacings from $a^{-1}\\approx 1.6$ GeV to $3.5$ GeV, identical to recent studies by FNAL/HPQCD/MILC and Aubin et al. and similar to the recent study of BMW. Our calculation exhibits a tension for the particularly interesting window result of $a_μ^{\\rm ud, conn.,isospin, W}$ from $0.4$ fm to $1.0$ fm with previous results obtained with a different discretization of the vector current on the same gauge configurations. Our results may indicate a difficulty related to estimating uncertainties of the continuum extrapolation that deserves further attention. In this work we also provide results for $a_μ^{\\rm ud,conn.,isospin}$, $a_μ^{\\rm s,conn.,isospin}$, $a_μ^{\\rm SIB,conn.}$ for the total contribution and a large set of windows. For the total contribution, we find $a_μ^{\\rm HVP~LO}=714(27)(13) 10^{-10}$, $a_μ^{\\rm ud,conn.,isospin}=657(26)(12) 10^{-10}$, $a_μ^{\\rm s,conn.,isospin}=52.83(22)(65) 10^{-10}$, and $a_μ^{\\rm SIB,conn.}=9.0(0.8)(1.2) 10^{-10}$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. We also comment on finite-volume corrections for the strong-isospin-breaking corrections.",

      "summary": "Machine learning has the potential to aid our understanding of phase structures in lattice quantum field theories through the statistical analysis of Monte Carlo samples. Available algorithms, in particular those based on deep learning, often demonstrate remarkable performance in the search for previously unidentified features, but tend to lack transparency if applied naively. To address these shortcomings, we propose representation learning in combination with interpretability methods as a framework for the identification of observables. More specifically, we investigate action parameter regression as a pretext task while using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to identify the most important observables depending on the location in the phase diagram. The approach is put to work in the context of a scalar Yukawa model in (2+1)d. First, we investigate a multilayer perceptron to determine an importance hierarchy of several predefined, standard observables. The method is then applied directly to the raw field configurations using a convolutional network, demonstrating the ability to reconstruct all order parameters from the learned filter weights. Based on our results, we argue that due to its broad applicability, attribution methods such as LRP could prove a useful and versatile tool in our search for new physical insights. In the case of the Yukawa model, it facilitates the construction of an observable that characterises the symmetric phase.",

The quark mass dependence, finite lattice spacing and volume corrections are taken into account simultaneously based on the calculation on three gauge ensembles including one at the physical pion mass. The nonzero value of the charm magnetic moment $μ^c_M=-0.00127(38)_{\\rm stat}(5)_{\\rm sys}$, as well as the Pauli form factor, reflects a nontrivial role of the charm sea in the nucleon spin structure. The nonzero $G^c_{E}(Q^2)$ indicates the existence of a nonvanishing asymmetric charm-anticharm sea in the nucleon. Performing a nonperturbative analysis based on holographic QCD and the generalized Veneziano model, we study the constraints on the $[c(x)-\\bar{c}(x)]$ distribution from the lattice QCD results presented here. Our results provide complementary information and motivation for more detailed studies of physical observables that are sensitive to intrinsic charm and for future global analyses of parton distributions including asymmetric charm-anticharm distribution.",

We then apply dChPT to a recent simulation by the LSD collaboration of the SU(3) gauge theory with 8 fermions in the fundamental representation, which is believed to exhibit near-conformal behavior in the infrared, and in which a light singlet scalar state, nearly degenerate with the pions, has been found. We find that the mesonic sector of this theory can be successfully described by dChPT, including, in particular, the mesonic taste splittings found in the simulation.

      "summary": "In this work we present the isovector flavor combination for the nucleon tensor charge extracted from lattice QCD simulations using overlap fermions on $N_f=2+1$ domain-wall configurations. The pion mass dependence is studied using six valence quark masses, each reproducing a value for the pion mass in the valence sector between 147 and 330 MeV. We investigate and eliminate systematic uncertainties due to contamination by excited states, by employing several values for the source-sink separation that span from 1 fm to 1.6 fm. We apply a chiral extrapolation in the valence sector using a quadratic and a logarithmic term to fit the pion mass dependence, which describes well the lattice data. The lattice matrix element is renormalized non-perturbatively, and the final result is $g_T=1.096(30)$ in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme at a renormalization scale of 2 GeV.",

      "summary": "New results are reported from tests of a low-energy effective field theory (EFT) that includes a dilaton field to describe the emergent light scalar with ${ 0^{++} }$ quantum numbers in the strongly coupled near-conformal gauge theory with a massless fermion flavor doublet in the two-index symmetric (sextet) representation of the SU(3) color gauge group. In the parlor of walking --- based on the observed light scalar, the small $β$-function at strong coupling, and the large anomalous scale dimension of the chiral condensate --- the dilaton EFT hypothesis is introduced to test if it explains the slowly changing nearly scale invariant physics that connects the asymptotically free UV fixed point and the far-infrared scale of chiral symmetry breaking. The characteristic dilaton EFT signatures of scale symmetry breaking are probed in this report in the small Compton wavelength limit of Goldstone bosons relative to the size of the lattice volume (p-regime) and in the limit when the Goldstone wavelength exceeds the size of the volume ($ε$-regime). Random matrix theory (RMT) analysis of the dilaton EFT is applied to the lowest part of the Dirac spectrum in the $ε$-regime to directly test predictions for the fundamental EFT parameters. The predictions, sensitive to the choice of the dilaton potential, were limited before to the p-regime, using extrapolations from far above the chiral limit with untested uncertainties. The dilaton EFT analysis of the $ε$-regime was first suggested in \\cite{Fodor:2019vmw}, with some results presented at this conference and with our continued post-conference analysis added to stimulate discussions.",

We optimize the definition of the crossover temperature $T_c$, allowing for its very precise determination, and extrapolate from imaginary chemical potential up to real $μ_B \\approx 300$ MeV. The definition of $T_c$ adopted in this work is based on the observation that the chiral susceptibility as a function of the condensate is an almost universal curve at zero and imaganiary $μ_B$. We obtain the parameters $κ_2=0.0153(18)$ and $κ_4=0.00032(67)$ as a continuum extrapolation based on $N_t=10,12$ and $16$ lattices with physical quark masses. We also extrapolate the peak value of the chiral susceptibility and the width of the chiral transition along the crossover line. In fact, both of these are consistent with a constant function of $μ_B$. We see no sign of criticality in the explored range.",

Examples of the impact of using different estimates of the excited state spectra are given for the clover-on-clover data, and as discussed in [1], the biggest difference on including the lower energy (close to $Nπ$ and $Nππ$) states is in the axial channel. (ii) Flavor diagonal axial, tensor and scalar charges, $g^{u,d,s}_{A,S,T}$, are calculated with the clover-on-HISQ formulation using nine 2+1+1-flavor HISQ ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration [2] with lattice parameters given in Table 2. Once finished, the calculations of $g^{u,d,s}_{A,T}$ will update the results given in Refs.[3,4]. The estimates for $g^{u,d,s}_{S}$ and $σ_{Nπ}$ are new. Overall, a large part of the focus is on understanding the excited state contamination (ESC), and the results discussed provide a partial status report on developing defensible analyses strategies that include contributions of possible low-lying excited states to individual nucleon matrix elements.",

For the strangeness neutral case ($μ_S=0$) at fixed ratio of electric charge to baryon number density ($\\frac{n_Q}{n_B}=0.4$), which is appropriate for a comparison with heavy ion collisions, we present results for $κ_B σ_B^2$, $S_B σ_B^3/M_B$, $κ^{H}_{B}σ_{B}^4$ and $S^{H}_{B}σ^5_{B}/M_{B}$ on the crossover line for the chiral transition, $T_{pc}(μ_B)$. Continuum extrapolations for this pseudo-critical transition line have recently been reported by HotQCD up to baryon chemical potentials $μ_B\\simeq 300$ MeV [arXiv:1812.08235]. These cumulant ratios are of direct relevance for comparisons with corresponding ratios measured by STAR in the BES-I and II runs at beam energies $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\ge 20$ GeV. In particular, we point out that recent high statistics results on skewness and kurtosis of net-baryon number distributions obtained by STAR at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 54.4$ GeV put strong constraints on freeze-out parameters and are consistent with predictions from thermal QCD.",

[1,2], we study the finite-volume effects for the $\\mathbf{2}+\\mathcal{J}\\to\\mathbf{2}$ matrix element of an external current coupled to a two-particle state of identical scalars with perturbative interactions. Working in a finite cubic volume with periodicity $L$, we derive a $1/L$ expansion of the matrix element through $\\mathcal O(1/L^5)$ and find that it is governed by two universal current-dependent parameters, the scalar charge and the threshold two-particle form factor. We confirm the result through a numerical study of the general formalism and additionally through an independent perturbative calculation. We further demonstrate a consistency with the Feynman-Hellmann theorem, which can be used to relate the $1/L$ expansions of the ground-state energy and matrix element. The latter gives a simple insight into why the leading volume corrections to the matrix element have the same scaling as those in the energy, $1/L^3$, in contradiction to earlier work, which found a $1/L^2$ contribution to the matrix element. We show here that such a term arises at intermediate stages in the perturbative calculation, but cancels in the final result.",

In this method one relies on the matrix elements of a Euclidean correlator in boosted hadronic states, which have an operator product expansion at short distance that allows us to extract the moments of PDFs. We renormalize the Euclidean correlator by forming the reduced Ioffe-time distribution (rITD), and reconstruct the second and fourth moments of the pion PDF by taking into account of QCD evolution effects.",

      "summary": "The nucleon axial form factors -- axial $G_A$, induced pseudoscalar $\\widetilde{G}_P$ and pseudoscalar $G_P$ -- have displayed large systematics in lattice QCD calculations. The major symptoms were the violation of the partially conserved axial current (PCAC) relation between the three form factors, and the underestimation of the induced pseudoscalar coupling $g_P^\\ast$ and the axial charge radius $r_A$ compared to phenomenological estimates. The small $g_P^\\ast$ was a consequence of the failure of the pion-pole dominance (PPD) hypothesis, especially at low $M_π^2$. The small charge radius $r_A$ and the underestimate of $g_A$ were related. The dominant systematic responsible is the lack of inclusion of low-energy ($N π$) states that are not manifest in the multiexponential fit to the nucleon two-point correlator. We show that this low-energy state can be determined from the three-point correlator $\\langle N A_4 N \\rangle $ with the insertion of the temporal component of the axial current $A_4$ within the nucleon state, ie, the strategy labeled $S_{A4}$ [1]. Including this low-energy state in fits to control excited-state contamination (ESC) gives results for $g_A$, $r_A$, and $g_P^\\ast$ that are consistent with experimental/phenomenological values. However, the systematic uncertainties, especially in data at small $Q^2$, are now much larger.",

This reduction in quantum resources is achieved by classically sampling configurations in imaginary-time using standard lattice field theory.

We study the phase diagram in a two and three dimensional periodic box at a fixed thermal to spatial aspect ratio, $\\fracβ{\\ell}$, with a flavor independent chemical potential. We assume the bilinear condensate, when one exists, has a specific momentum in the spatial direction(s). The main known features of the phase diagram in the $\\ell\\to\\infty$ limit of the two dimensional model are also seen on a finite $\\ell\\timesβ$ torus -- a phase with a homogeneous (zero momentum) condensate; a phase with an inhomogeneous (non-zero momentum) condensate and a phase with no condensate. We observe that the inhomogeneous phase contains several sub-phases characterized by a specific spatial momentum. Unlike the two dimensional model, we do not find evidence for a phase with a inhomogeneous condensate in the three dimensional model.",

Representation of the Taylor expansions of higher order cumulants in terms of the ratio of the two lowest order cumulants, $M_B/σ_B^2=χ_1^B(T,μ_B)/χ_2^B(T,μ_B)$, allows for a parameter free comparison with data on net proton-number cumulants obtained by the STAR Collaboration in the Beam Energy Scan at RHIC. We show that recent high statistics data on skewness and kurtosis ratios of net proton-number distributions, obtained at beam energy $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=54.4$ GeV, agree well with lattice QCD results on cumulants of net baryon-number fluctuations close to the pseudo-critical temperature, $T_{pc}(μ_B)$, for the chiral transition in QCD. We also present first results from a next-to-leading order expansion of $5^{th}$ and $6^{th}$ order cumulants on the line of pseudo-critical temperatures.",

The approach proposed is based on an eigenvalue decomposition in the space of coupled-channels and partial-waves, which proves to have several desirable and simplifying features that are of great benefit when considering problems beyond simple elastic scattering of spinless particles. We illustrate the method with a toy model of vector-vector scattering featuring a high density of solutions, and with an application to explicit lattice QCD energy level data describing $J^P=1^-$ and $1^+$ scattering in several coupled channels.",

On generated configurations, we study the axial $U(1)$ symmetry, overlap-Dirac spectra, screening masses from mesonic correlators, and topological susceptibility. We find that some of the observables are quite sensitive to lattice artifacts due to a small violation of the chiral symmetry. For those observables, we reweight the Möbius domain-wall fermion determinant by that of the overlap fermion. We also check the volume dependence of observables. Our data near the chiral limit indicates a strong suppression of the axial $U(1)$ anomaly at temperatures $\\geq$ 220 MeV.",

We apply this method to perform a first-principles calculation of the $π^0 \\rightarrow e^+ e^-$ decay amplitude. Both the real and imaginary parts of amplitude are calculated. The imaginary part is compared with the prediction of optical theorem to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.

      "summary": "We studied the temporal correlation function of mesons in the pseudo-scalar channel in (2+1)-flavor QCD in the presence of external magnetic fields at zero temperature. The simulations were performed on $32^3 \\times 96$ lattices using the Highly Improved Staggered Quarks (HISQ) action with $m_π \\approx $ 230 MeV. The strength of magnetic fields $|eB|$ ranges from 0 to around 3.3 GeV$^2$ ($\\sim 60 m_π^2$). We found that the masses of neutral pseudo-scalar particles, e.g. neutral pion and kaon, monotonouslly decrease as the magnetic field grows and then saturate at a nonzero value. It is observed that heavier neutral pseudo-scalars are less affected by magnetic fields. Moreover, we found a non-monotonous behavior of charged pion and kaon mass in magnetic field for the first time. In the case of small magnetic field (0 $\\leq~|eB| \\lesssim$ 0.3 GeV$^2~\\sim 6m_π^2$ ) the mass of charged pseudo-scalar grows with magnetic field and can be well described by the Lowest Landau Level approximation, while for $|eB|$ larger than 0.3 GeV$^2$ the mass starts to decrease. The possible connection between $|eB|$ dependences of neutral pion mass and the decreasing behavior of pseudo-critical temperature in magnetic field is discussed. Due to the nonzero value of neutral pion mass our simulation indicates that the superconducting phase of QCD does not exist in the current window of magnetic field.",

Simulations of (2 + 1)-flavor QCD are performed using the Highly Improved Staggered Quarks (HISQ/tree) action on $N_τ$ = 8 lattices with aspect ratios $N_σ/N_τ$ ranging from 5 to 7. The strange quark mass is fixed to its physical value $m_{s}^{\\rm phy}$, and the light quark masses $m_{l}$ are varied from $m_{s}^{\\rm phy}/40$ to $m_{s}^{\\rm phy}/160$ which correspond to pion mass $m_π$ ranging from 110 MeV to 55 MeV in the continuum limit. We compute the chiral condensate and $χ_π - χ_δ$ through the eigenvalue spectrum obtained from the the eigenvalue filtering method. We compare these results with those obtained from a direct calculation of the observables which involves inversions of the fermion matrix using the stochastic \"noise vector\" method. We find that these approaches yield consistent results. Furthermore, we also investigate the quark mass and temperature dependences of the Dirac eigenvalue density at zero eigenvalues to gain more insights about the $U_A(1)$ symmetry breaking in QCD.",

We derive the Ioffe time distribution of the two-current correlations in the physical limit by investigating the finite lattice spacing, volume, quark mass, and higher-twist dependencies in a simultaneous fit of matrix elements computed on four gauge ensembles. We find remarkable consistency between our extracted $q^π_{\\rm v}(x)$ and that obtained from experimental data across the entire $x$-range. Further, we demonstrate that the one-loop matching coefficient relating the LQCD matrix computed in position space to the $q_{\\rm v}^π(x)$ in momentum space has well-controlled behavior with Ioffe time. This justifies that LQCD calculated current-current correlations are good observables for extracting partonic structures by using QCD factorization, which complements to the global effort to extract partonic structure from experimental data.",

We show that the large scale geometry of the extended configuration space is given by an asymptotically anti-de Sitter metric, and argue in a simple, geometrical way that the tempering parameter should be best placed exponentially to acquire high acceptance rates for transitions in the extra dimension.

It tames both the sign and ergodicity problems simultaneously by tempering the system with the flow time of continuous deformations of the integration region. In this article, after reviewing the basics of the TLTM, we explain a new algorithm within the TLTM that enables us to estimate the expectation values precisely with a criterion ensuring global equilibrium and the sufficiency of the sample size. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, we apply the TLTM to the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the Hubbard model away from half filling on a two-dimensional lattice of small size, and show that the obtained numerical results agree nicely with exact values.",

We focus on $1+1$ dimensional quantum electrodynamics with the $θ$-term known as the Schwinger model. We construct the true vacuum state of a lattice Schwinger model using adiabatic state preparation which, in turn, allows us to compute an expectation value of the fermion mass operator with respect to the vacuum. Upon taking a continuum limit we find that our result in massless case agrees with the known exact result. In massive case, we find an agreement with mass perturbation theory in small mass regime and deviations in large mass regime. We estimate computational costs required to take a reasonable continuum limit. Our results imply that digital quantum simulation is already useful tool to explore non-perturbative aspects of gauge theories with real time and topological terms.",
