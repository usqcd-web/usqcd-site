      "summary": "We present our recent high precision calculations (Phys. Rev. D102 (2020) no.5, 054512 and JHEP 04 (2021) 044, JHEP 21 (2020) 004) of the first moment of nucleon isovector polarized, unpolarized and transversity distributions, i.e., momentum fraction, helicity and transversity moment, respectively. We use the standard method for the calculation of these moments (via matrix elements of twist two operators), and carry out a detailed analysis of the sources of systematic uncertainty, in particular of excited state contributions. Our calculations have been performed using two different lattice setups (Clover-on-HISQ and Clover-on-Clover), each with several ensembles. They give consistent results that are in agreement with global fit analyses.",

      "summary": "Lattice QCD plays an increasing role in reducing theoretical uncertainties in kaon decays. Here we focus on kaon decay channels $K\\to \\ellν_\\ell \\ell'^+ \\ell'^-$, which are closely related to radiative kaon decays since the lepton pairs $\\ell'^+ \\ell'^-$ come from virtual photon emission: $K\\to \\ellν_\\ell γ^* \\to \\ellν_\\ell \\ell'^+ \\ell'^-$. Compared with real photon emission, these channels involve more complicated form factors due to the off-shell photon with possible large momentum transfer, which causes a challenge to lattice-QCD studies. In this work, we introduce a lattice calculation procedure for their decay width, which can avoid parameterization of form factors. The systematic errors in our method are found to be controllable. Infinite volume reconstruction method is adopted to remove the temporal truncation effects and reduce finite volume effects from kaon intermediate state. This approach sets up a bridge between lattice QCD calculation and experimental measurement of decay width.",

      "summary": "We present results for the nucleon structure functions and form factors obtained from 2+1 flavor lattice QCD with physical light quark masses ($m_π=135$ MeV) in a large spatial extent of about 10 fm. Our calculations are performed with the PACS10 gauge configurations generated by the PACS Collaboration with the six stout-smeared ${\\mathscr{O}}(a)$ improved Wilson-clover quark action and Iwasaki gauge action at $β=1.82$ and $2.00$ corresponding to lattice spacings of $0.085$ fm and $0.064$ fm respectively. The lower moments of structure functions, $\\langle x \\rangle_{u-d}$ and $\\langle x \\rangle_{Δu - Δd}$ given by the twist-2 operators being properly renormalized, are evaluated in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme at the renormalization scale of 2 GeV only at $β=1.82$, since the renormalization factors at $β=2.00$ have not yet determined nonperturbatively in the RI/MOM scheme. Instead, at two lattice spacings, we evaluate appropriate ratios of $g_{A}/g_{V}$ and $\\langle x \\rangle_{u-d}/\\langle x \\rangle_{Δu -Δd}$, which are not renormalized in the continuum limit. These quantities thus can be directly compared with the experimental data without the renormalization.",

      "summary": "Tracking the dynamics of physical systems in real time is a prime application of digital quantum computers. Using a trapped-ion system with up to six qubits, we simulate the real-time dynamics of a lattice gauge theory in 1+1 dimensions, i.e., the lattice Schwinger model, and demonstrate non-perturbative effects such as pair creation for times much longer than previously accessible. We study the gate requirement of two formulations of the model using the Suzuki-Trotter product formula, as well as the trade-off between errors from the ordering of the Hamiltonian terms, the Trotter step size, and experimental imperfections. To mitigate experimental errors, a recent symmetry-protection protocol for suppressing coherent errors and a symmetry-inspired post-selection scheme are applied. This work demonstrates the integrated theoretical, algorithmic, and experimental approach that is essential for efficient simulation of lattice gauge theories and other complex physical systems.",

Two-baryon channels with strangeness $0$ to $-4$ are analyzed, with findings that point to interesting symmetries observed in hypernuclear forces as predicted in the limit of QCD with a large number of colors. Also, several matrix elements of light nuclei are studied. The tritium axial charge, related to the Gamow-Teller matrix element, and the longitudinal momentum fraction of $^3$He that is carried by the isovector combination of $u$ and $d$ are extracted and extrapolated to the physical point. For this latter case, it can be seen how including lattice results to experimental determinations can have imminent potential to enable more precise determinations and to reveal the QCD origins of the EMC effect.",

      "summary": "A variational study of two-nucleon systems with lattice quantum chromodynamics is performed using a wide range of interpolating operators: dibaryon operators built from products of momentum-projected nucleons, hexaquark operators built from six spatially localized quarks, and quasi-local operators inspired by two-nucleon bound-state wavefunctions in nuclear effective field theories. Correlation-function matrices involving products of these operators are constructed by computing timeslice-to-all quark propagators with sparsening techniques. Comparisons between results obtained using the same gauge-field ensemble but different interpolating-operator sets demonstrate that interpolating-operator dependence can lead to significant effects on the two-nucleon energy spectra obtained using both variational and non-variational methods.",

In particular, by encoding the simultaneous distribution of quark transverse positions and momenta, they allow one to directly access longitudinal quark orbital angular momentum, and, moreover, to correlate it with the quark helicity. The relevant GTMD is evaluated through a lattice calculation of a proton matrix element of a quark bilocal operator (the separation in which is Fourier conjugate to the quark momentum) featuring a momentum transfer (which is Fourier conjugate to the quark position), as well as the Dirac structure appropriate for capturing the quark helicity. The weighting by quark transverse position requires a derivative with respect to momentum transfer, which is obtained in unbiased fashion using a direct derivative method. The lattice calculation is performed directly at the physical pion mass, using domain wall fermions to mitigate operator mixing effects. Both the Jaffe-Manohar as well as the Ji quark spin-orbit correlations are extracted, yielding evidence for a strong quark spin-orbit coupling in the proton.",

To make further progress, electromagnetic and strong isospin breaking effects must be included in lattice QCD simulations.\n  We present the status of the RBC/UKQCD lattice calculation of isospin-breaking corrections to light meson leptonic decays. This computation is performed in a (2+1)-flavor QCD simulation using Domain Wall Fermions with near-physical quark masses. The isospin-breaking effects are implemented via a perturbative expansion of the action in $α$ and $(m_u-m_d)$. In this calculation, we work in the electro-quenched approximation and the photons are implemented in the Feynman gauge and $\\text{QED}_\\text{L}$ formulation.",

The use of Möbius domain-wall fermions with stout-link smearing is more effective on the finer lattices where all the relevant chiral symmetries are realized more accurately.

      "summary": "We study the Renormalisation Group (RG) running of the quark mass, for $N_f=3$ QCD with Wilson fermions in a mixed action setup, with standard Schrödinger Functional (SF) boundary conditions for sea quarks and chirally rotated Schrödinger Functional ($χ$SF) boundary conditions for valence quarks. This necessitates the tuning of the boundary factor $z_f(g_0^2)$ of the $χ$SF valence action, in order to ensure that QCD symmetries are fully recovered in the continuum. The properties of this novel setup are monitored through the ratios $Z_S/Z_P$ and $Σ_S/Σ_P$ of the renormalisation parameters and step scaling functions of the scalar and pseudoscalar densities. Where comparison is possible, our $Z_S/Z_P$ results are found to agree with previous determinations, based on a mass ratio method arXiv:1906.03445 and Ward identities arXiv:2005.01352, arXiv:2101.10969, with Schrödinger Functional boundary conditions. The behaviour of $Σ_S/Σ_P$ confirms the theoretical expectations of $χ$SF QCD, related to the restoration of the theory's symmetries in the continuum limit. From the step scaling function of the pseudoscalar density we obtain the quark mass RG-running function from hadronic to perturbative energy scales. This is fully compatible with the earlier result obtained in a similar setup for Wilson quarks with Schrödinger Functional boundary conditions arXiv:1802.05243 and provides a strong universality test for the two lattice setups.",

We present a practical digitization for $SU(3)$ gauge theories via its discrete subgroup $S(1080)$. Using a modified action that allows classical simulations down to $a\\approx 0.08$ fm, the low-lying glueball spectrum is computed with percent-level precision at multiple lattice spacings and shown to extrapolate to the continuum limit $SU(3)$ results. This suggests that this digitization scheme is sufficient for precision quantum simulations of QCD.",

The lattice results of the quark spin from the axial-vector current matrix element at $\\sim 0.3- 0.4$ is smaller than those from the constituent quark models. This is largely due to the fact that the vacuum polarization contribution from the disconnected insertion is negative. Its connection with the anomalous Ward identity is clarified and verified numerically. This resolves the contentious issue in the `proton spin crisis'. The glue spin and angular momentum are found to be large and there is notable contribution from the quark orbital angular momentum. Renormalization, mixing and normalization of the quark and glue angular momenta are discussed. With sufficient precision, they can be compared with more precise experimental measurements when the electron-ion collider facility is available.",

      "summary": "The generalized parton distributions (GPDs) offer a window on three-dimensional imaging of the nucleon, providing understanding of how the fundamental properties of the nucleon, such as its mass and spin, arise from the underlying quark and gluon degrees of freedom. In this work, we present the first lattice calculation of the nucleon isovector helicity GPD at physical pion mass, using an $a \\approx 0.09$ fm lattice ensemble with 2+1+1 flavors of highly improved staggered quarks generated by MILC Collaboration. We perform the GPD calculation in Breit frame using averaged nucleon boost momentum $P_z \\approx 2.2$ GeV with nonzero momentum transfers in $[0.2,1.0]\\text{ GeV}^2$. Nonperturbative renormalization in RI/MOM scheme is used to obtain the quasi-distribution before matching to the lightcone GPDs. The three-dimensional distribution $\\tilde{H}(x,Q^2)$ is presented, along with the three-dimensional nucleon tomography and impact-parameter--dependent distribution for selected Bjorken $x$ at $μ=3$ GeV in $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme.",

      "title": "Bottomonia screening masses from $2 + 1$ flavor QCD",
      "summary": "The sequential melting of the bottomonium states is one of the important signals for the existence of a quark gluon plasma. The study of bottomonia spectral functions on the lattice is a difficult task for many reasons. Calculations based on NRQCD, that are commonly used for such purpose, are not applicable at high temperatures. In this work we propose a new method to study this problem by calculating the spatial screening masses of bottomonium states. We calculate the spatial meson correlators and extract the screening masses for mesons in different quantum channels using highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action for bottom quarks and dynamical $2+1$ flavor QCD HISQ gauge configurations. The typical lattices we choose are of size $N_s^3 \\times N_τ$ where $N_s=4 N_τ$ and $N_τ=8, 10, 12$. We consider the temperature range $T = 300$-$1000$ MeV. We show that for $T > 500$ MeV the temperature dependence of the screening masses of the ground state bottomonia are compatible with the expectations based on uncorrelated quark anti-quark pairs.",

Excited state effects are studied using several sink-source time separations in the range 0.8 fm - 1.6 fm, exponentially increasing statistics with the separation such that statistical errors remain approximately constant. In addition, quark loop disconnected diagrams are included in order to extract the isoscalar axial form factors and the proton and neutron electromagnetic form factors, as well as their strange-quark contributions. The radii and moments are extracted by modelling the $Q^2$ dependence, including using the so-called $z$-expansion. A preliminary assessment of lattice cut-off effects is presented using two lattice spacings directly at the physical point.",

This approach relates lattice QCD data and light-cone distribution functions using Large Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET).

We use three values of the momentum boost, namely 0.83, 1.25, 1.67 GeV. The GPDs are defined in the symmetric (Breit) frame, which we implement here with 4-vector momentum transfer squared of 0, 0.69 and 1.39 GeV 2 , all at zero skewness.

Furthermore, results from different methods, including the use of the Luscher formalism with different types of operators, as well as the HALQCD potential method, do not agree even qualitatively at very heavy pion mass. We investigate the role that different operators employed in the literature may play on the extraction of spectra for use within the Luscher method. We first explore expectations from Effective Field Theory solved within a finite volume, for which the exact spectrum may be computed given different physical scenarios. We then present preliminary lattice QCD results for two-nucleon spectra calculated using different operators on a common lattice ensemble.",

Inspired by the concept of Fourier acceleration, we study a version of the Riemannian Manifold HMC (RMHMC) algorithm in which the canonical mass term of the HMC algorithm is replaced by a rational function of the SU(3) gauge covariant Laplacian. We have developed a suite of tools using Chebyshev filters based on the SU(3) gauge covariant Laplacian that provides the power spectra of both the gauge and fermion forces and determines the spectral dependence of the resulting RMHMC evolution of long- and short-distance QCD observables. These tools can be used to optimize the RMHMC mass term and to monitor the resulting acceleration mode-wise.",

The quark masses are chosen so that they produce a pion mass of about 265 MeV, and a kaon mass of 530 MeV. The lattice spacing of the ensemble is 0.093 fm and the lattice has a spatial extent of 3 fm. We use a rest frame, as well as a boosted frame to obtain the form factors for a wider and denser set of four-vector momentum transfer squared, $Q^2$. To assess and eliminate excited-states contamination, we analyze several values of the source-sink time separation within the range of 1.12 - 2.23 fm (1.12 - 1.67 fm) for the rest (boosted) frame. The $Q^2$ dependence of the form factors is parametrized using a monopole fit, which leads to the extraction of the corresponding radius, and the tensor anomalous magnetic moment for the tensor form factor. The results for these parametrizations are compared for the pion and kaon to assess the level of the SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking.",

      "summary": "We present a calculation of the connected-diagram contributions to the first three non-trivial Mellin moments for the pion and kaon, extracted using local operators with up to 3 covariant derivatives. We use one ensemble of gauge configurations with two degenerate light, a strange and a charm quark ($N_f$=2+1+1) of maximally twisted mass fermions with clover improvement. The ensemble has a pion mass $\\sim$260 MeV, and a kaon mass $\\sim$530 MeV. We reconstruct the $x$-dependence of the PDFs via fits to our results, and find that our lattice data favor a $(1-x)^2$-behavior in the large-$x$ region for both the pion and kaon PDFs. We integrate the reconstructed PDFs to extract the higher moments, $\\langle x^n \\rangle$, with $4 \\leq n \\leq 6$. Finally, we compare the pion and kaon PDFs, as well as the ratios of their Mellin moments, to address the effect of SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking.",

The kaon correlators are calculated using clover fermions and momentum-smearing sources with maximum boost momentum around 2~GeV and high statistics (up to 324,000 measurements). We study the dependence of the resulting reduced Ioffe-time pseudo-distributions at multiple boost momenta and lattice spacings. We then extract the kaon gluon distribution function in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme at $μ= 2$~GeV, neglecting the mixing between the gluon and singlet-quark sectors.

In our work we use lattice-QCD simulations with temporal extents of $N_τ=8,10$ and $12$ to quantify corrections to the ideal HRG. Firstly, we determine a number of subleading fugacity expansion coefficients of the QCD free energy via a two-dimensional scan on the imaginary baryon number chemical potential ($μ_B$) - strangeness chemical potential ($μ_S$) plane. Using the aforementioned coefficients, we also extrapolate ratios of baryon number and strangeness fluctuations and correlations to finite chemical potentials via a truncated fugacity expansion. Our results extrapolated along the crossover line $T_\\mathrm{c}(μ_B)$ at strangeness neutrality are able to reproduce trends of experimental net-proton fluctuations measured by the STAR Collaboration.",

      "summary": "Approaches to finite baryon density lattice QCD usually suffer from uncontrolled systematic uncertainties in addition to the well-known sign problem. We test a method - sign reweighting - that works directly at finite chemical potential and is yet free from any such uncontrolled systematics: with this approach the only problem is the sign problem itself. In practice the approach involves the generation of configurations with the positive fermionic weights given by the absolute value of the real part of the quark determinant, and a reweighting by a sign. There are only two sectors, +1 and -1 and as long as the average $\\left\\langle \\pm \\right\\rangle \\neq 0$ (with respect to the positive weight) this discrete reweighting has no overlap problem - unlike reweighting from $μ=0$ - and the results are reliable. We also present results based on this algorithm on the phase diagram of lattice QCD with two different actions: as a first test, we apply the method to calculate the position of the critical endpoint with unimproved staggered fermions at $N_τ=4$; as a second application, we study the phase diagram with 2stout improved staggered fermions at $N_τ=6$. This second one is already a reasonably fine lattice - relevant for phenomenology. We demonstrate that the method penetrates the region of the phase diagram where the Taylor and imaginary chemical potential methods lose predictive power.",

When the qubit-regularized lattice quantum fields preserve important symmetries of the original theory, qubit regularization naturally enforces certain algebraic structures on these quantum fields. We introduce the concept of qubit embedding algebras (QEAs) to characterize this algebraic structure associated with a qubit regularization scheme. We show a systematic procedure to derive QEAs for the O(N) lattice spin models and the SU(N) lattice gauge theories. While some of the QEAs we find were discovered earlier in the context of the D-theory approach, our method shows that QEAs are far more richer. A more complete understanding of the QEAs could be helpful in recovering the fixed points of the desired quantum field theories.",

In this talk, we discuss the prospects of using these to study Compton scattering for arbitrary kinematics. The restriction to a finite-volume spacetime, unavoidable in foreseeable quantum-computer simulations, must be taken into account in the formalism for extracting scattering observables. One approach is to work with a non-zero $i ε$-prescription in the Fourier transform to definite momentum and then to estimate an ordered double limit, in which the spacetime volume is sent to infinity before $ε$ is sent to $0$. For the amplitudes and parameters considered here, we find that significant volume effects arise, making the required limit very challenging. We present a practical solution to this challenge that may allow for future determinations of deeply virtual Compton scattering amplitudes, as well as many other reactions that are presently outside the scope of standard lattice QCD calculations.",

      "summary": "We present results on the behavior of the boundary-boundary correlation function of scalar fields propagating on discrete two-dimensional random triangulations representing manifolds with the topology of a disk. We use a gravitational action that includes a curvature squared operator, which favors a regular tessellation of hyperbolic space for large values of its coupling. We probe the resultant geometry by analyzing the propagator of a massive scalar field and show that the conformal behavior seen in the uniform hyperbolic space survives as the coupling approaches zero. The analysis of the boundary correlator suggests that holographic predictions survive, at least, weak quantum gravity corrections. We then show how such an $R^2$ operator might be induced as a result of integrating out massive lattice fermions and show preliminary result for boundary correlation functions that include the effects of this fermionic backreaction on the geometry.",

      "summary": "We investigate the Dirac eigenvalue spectrum ($ρ(λ,m_l)$) to study the microscopic origin of axial anomaly in high temperature phase of QCD. We propose novel relations between the derivatives ($\\partial^n ρ(λ,m_l)/\\partial m_l^n$) of the Dirac eigenvalue spectrum with respect to the quark mass ($m_l$) and the $(n+1)$-point correlations among the eigenvalues ($λ$) of the massless Dirac operator. Based on these relations, we present lattice QCD results for $\\partial^n ρ(λ,m_l)/\\partial m_l^n$ ($n=1, 2, 3$) with $m_l$ corresponding to pion masses $m_π=160-55$ MeV, and at a temperature of about 1.6 times the chiral phase transition temperature. Calculations were carried out using (2+1)-flavors of highly improved staggered quarks and the tree-level Symanzik gauge action with the physical strange quark mass, three lattice spacings $a=0.12, 0.08, 0.06$ fm, and lattices having aspect ratios $4-9$. We find that $ρ(λ\\to0,m_l)$ develops a peaked structure. This peaked structure, which arises due to non-Poisson correlations within the infrared part of the Dirac eigenvalue spectrum, becomes sharper as $a\\to0$, and its amplitude is proportional to $m_l^2$. After continuum and chiral extrapolations, we find that the axial anomaly remains manifested in two-point correlation functions of scalar and pseudo-scalar mesons in the chiral limit. We demonstrate that the behavior of $ρ(λ\\to0,m_l)$ is responsible for it.",

      "summary": "We investigate the criticality of chiral phase transition manifested in the first and second order derivatives of Dirac eigenvalue spectrum with respect to light quark mass in (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD. Simulations are performed at temperatures from about 137 MeV to 176 MeV on $N_τ=8$ lattices using the highly improved staggered quarks and the tree-level improved Symanzik gauge action. The strange quark mass is fixed to its physical value $m_s^{\\text{phy}}$ and the light quark mass is set to $m_s^{\\text{phy}}/40$ which corresponds to a Goldstone pion mass $m_π=110$ MeV. We find that in contrast to the case at $T\\simeq 205$ MeV $m_l^{-1} \\partial ρ(λ, m_l)/\\partial m_l$ is no longer equal to $\\partial ^2ρ(λ, m_l)/\\partial m_l^2$ and $\\partial ^2ρ(λ, m_l)/\\partial m_l^2$ even becomes negative at certain low temperatures. This means that as temperature getting closer to $T_c$ $ρ(λ, m_l)$ is no longer proportional to $m_l^2$ and thus dilute instanton gas approximation is not valid for these temperatures. We demonstrate the temperature dependence can be factored out in $\\partial ρ(λ, m_l)/ \\partial m_l$ and $\\partial^2 ρ(λ, m_l)/ \\partial m_l^2$ at $T \\in [137, 153]$ MeV, and then we propose a feasible method to estimate the power $c$ given $ρ\\propto m_l^{c}$.",

We focus in particular on the behavior of boundary-boundary correlators, which exhibit power-law scaling both below and above the bulk critical temperature indicating scale invariance of the boundary theory at any temperature. This conclusion is strengthened by a finite-size scaling analysis of the boundary susceptibility which yields a scaling exponent consistent with the scaling dimension extracted from the boundary correlation function. This observation provides evidence that the connection between continuum boundary conformal symmetry and isometries of the bulk hyperbolic space survives for simple interacting field theories even when the bulk is approximated by a discrete tessellation.",

Inclusion of QED is an important systematic error correction to $K\\toππ$ decays. In this talk, we present a method of including a truncated, finite-range Coulomb interaction in a finite-volume lattice QCD calculation. We show how the omission caused by the truncation can be restored by an infinite-volume analytic calculation so that the final result contains no power-law finite-volume errors beyond those usually present in Luscher's finite-volume phase shift determination. This approach allows us to calculate the QED corrected infinite-volume phase shift for $ππ$ scattering in Coulomb gauge, a necessary ingredient to $K\\toππ$, while neglecting the transverse radiation for now.",

We established that the RW endpoint belongs to the 3-$d$, $Z_2$ universality class when calculations are done with the Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) action in the RW plane with physical quark masses. We also have explored a range of quark masses corresponding to pion mass values, $m_π\\geq40$~MeV and found that the transition is consistent with $Z_2$ universality class. We argue that observables that were usually used to determine the chiral phase transition temperature, e.g. the chiral condensate and chiral susceptibility, are sensitive to the RW transition and are energy-like observables for the $Z_2$ transition, contrary to the magnetic-like (order parameter) behavior at vanishing chemical potential. Moreover the calculations performed at $m_π\\sim40$~MeV also put a stringent constraint for a critical pion mass at zero chemical potential for a possible first-order chiral phase transition.",

      "summary": "We explore the interactions between a quark anti-quark pair in a thermal medium based on lattice QCD ensembles with $N_f = 2+1$ dynamical HISQ flavors. Our dataset spans the phenomenologically relevant temperature range between T=140MeV-2GeV based on lattice sizes $N_τ=10,12$ and $16$, with an aspect ratio of $N_σ/N_τ=4$. The peak position $Ω$ and the width $Γ$ of the spectral function of Wilson-line correlators in Coulomb gauge is computed. We assess the information content in the correlation functions and deploy three complementary strategies to reconstruct spectral information: model fits, Padé approximation and the Bayesian BR method. Limitations of each approach are carefully assessed.",

Our result is compatible with its SF counterpart of ref.1802.05243, confirming the universality of $χ$SF and SF in the continuum limit. We also establish the optimal tuning strategy for the critical hopping parameter $κ_c$ and the $χ$SF boundary counterterm coefficient $z_{\\rm f}$.

      "summary": "We introduce a strongly interacting lattice field theory model containing two flavors of massless staggered fermions with two kinds of interactions: (1) a lattice current-current interaction, and (2) an on-site four-fermion interaction. At weak couplings, we expect a massless fermion phase since our interactions become irrelevant at long distances. At strong couplings, based on previous studies, we argue that our lattice model contains two different massive fermion phases with different mechanisms of fermion mass generation. In one phase, fermions become massive through Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB) via the formation of a fermion bilinear condensate. In the other phase, fermion mass arises through a more exotic mechanism without the formation of any fermion bilinear condensate. Our lattice model is free of sign problems and can be studied using the fermion bag algorithm. The longer term goal here is to study both these mass generation phenomena in a single model and understand how different phases come together.",

Sharing the advantage with the original tempered Lefschetz thimble method (TLTM) that the sign problem is resolved without introducing the ergodicity problem, the new algorithm is expected to significantly reduce the computational cost, because it eliminates the need to compute the Jacobian of the flow in generating a configuration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the WV-TLTM with its successful application to the Stephanov model (a chiral random matrix model), for which the complex Langevin method is known to suffer from a serious wrong convergence problem. We also discuss the statistical analysis method for the WV-TLTM.",

      "summary": "We study pion-pion scattering in partially-quenched twisted-mass lattice QCD using chiral perturbation theory. The specific partially-quenched setup corresponds to that used in numerical lattice QCD calculations of the $I=0$ scattering length. We study the discretization errors proportional to $a^2$, with $a$ the lattice spacing, and the errors that arise due to the use of Lüscher's two-particle quantization condition in a theory that is not unitary. We argue that the former can be as large as $\\sim 100\\%$, but explain how they can be systematically subtracted using a calculation of the $I=2$ scattering amplitude in the same partially-quenched framework. We estimate the error from the violation of unitarity to be $\\sim 25\\%$, and argue that this error will be difficult to reduce in practice.",

We focus on a simple class of such models with a five dimensional local Hilbert space. We demonstrate how even the simplest model reproduces asymptotic freedom within the D-theory formalism but at the cost of increasing the size of the Hilbert space through coupling several layers of a two-dimensional lattice. We then argue that qubit regularization can be viewed as an effective field theory (EFT) even if the continuum limit cannot be reached, as long as we can tune the model close enough to the continuum limit where perturbation theory, or other analytical techniques, become viable. We construct a simple lattice model on a single layer with a four dimensional local Hilbert space that acts like an excellent EFT of the original theory.",

The study exploits the idea that twisted boundary conditions reduce finite volume effects, leading to an effective size in the twisted plane that combines the number of colours and the torus period.

In this work we discuss a range of issues that arise when implementing this formalism in practice, provide further theoretical results that can be used to check the implementation, and make available codes for implementing the three-particle quantization condition. Specifically, we discuss the need to modify the upper limit of the cutoff function due to the fact that the left-hand cut in the scattering amplitudes for two nondegenerate particles moves closer to threshold; we describe the decomposition of the three-particle amplitude $\\mathcal{K}_\\text{df,3}$ into the matrix basis used in the quantization condition, including both $s$ and $p$ waves, with the latter arising in the amplitude for two nondegenerate particles; we derive the threshold expansion for the lightest three-particle state in the rest frame up to $\\mathcal{O}(1/L^5)$; and we calculate the leading-order predictions in chiral perturbation theory for $\\mathcal{K}_\\text{df,3}$ in the $π^+π^+K^+$ and $π^+K^+K^+$ systems. We focus mainly on systems with two identical particles plus a third that is different (\"2+1\" systems). We describe the formalism in full detail, and present numerical explorations in toy models, in particular checking that the results agree with the threshold expansion, and making a prediction for the spectrum of $π^+π^+K^+$ levels using the two- and three-particle interactions predicted by chiral perturbation theory.",

Our findings are consistent with the occurrence of a second order chiral phase transition at vanishing values of the quark masses. The chiral phase transition temperature at this finite value of the lattice spacing is determined to be $T_c = 98_{-6}^{+3}~{\\rm MeV}$.

The calculation is performed by using dedicated ensembles with $N_f=4$ degenerate dynamical twisted mass (clover) fermions and the Iwasaki gauge action. A detailed analysis is reported, with emphasis on the control or subtraction of the hadronic contaminations occurring in the lattice estimators of RCs and a check of proper scaling with $a^2$ of the final results. Such a careful study of systematic errors is the counterpart of the high statistical precision reached by current calculations of RCs in the RI'-MOM scheme and is important in order to quote accurate results in phenomenological applications, such as the computation of quark masses.",

In lattice QCD, the gradient flow has been demonstrated to remove ultraviolet singularities from the topological susceptibility. In contrast, lattice simulations of the NLSM find that the topological susceptibility diverges in the continuum limit, even in the presence of the gradient flow. We introduce a $θ$-term and analyze the topological charge as a function of $θ$ under the gradient flow. Our results show that divergence persists in the presence of the flow, even at non-zero $θ$.",

The statistical uncertainties of the glueball correlation functions are considerably reduced through the cluster decomposition error reduction (CDER) method. The Bethe-Salpeter wave functions are obtained for the scalar, tensor and pseudoscalar glueballs by using spatially extended glueball operators defined through the gauge potential $A_μ(x)$ in the Coulomb gauge. These wave functions show similar features of non-relativistic two-gluon systems, and they are used to optimize the signals of the related correlation functions at the early time regions. Consequently, the ground state masses can be extracted precisely. To the extent that the excited state contamination is not important, our calculation gives glueball masses at the physical pion mass for the first time.",

      "summary": "Lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) has the promise of constraining low-energy constants (LECs) of nuclear effective field theories (EFTs) from first-principles calculations that incorporate the dynamics of quarks and gluons. Given the Euclidean and finite-volume nature of LQCD outputs, complex mappings are developed in recent years to obtain the Minkowski and infinite-volume counterparts of LQCD observables. In particular, as LQCD is moving toward computing a set of important few-nucleon matrix elements at the physical values of the quark masses, it is important to investigate whether the anticipated precision of LQCD spectra and matrix elements will be sufficient to guarantee tighter constraints on the relevant LECs than those already obtained from phenomenology, considering the non-trivial mappings involved. With a focus on the leading-order LECs of the pionless EFT, $L_{1,A}$ and $g_ν^{NN}$, which parametrize, respectively, the strength of the isovector axial two-body current in a single-$β$ decay (and other related processes such $pp$ fusion), and of the isotensor contact two-body operator in the neutrinoless double-$β$ decay within the light neutrino exchange scenario, the expected uncertainty on future extractions of $L_{1,A}$ and $g_ν^{NN}$ are examined using synthetic data at the physical values of the quark masses. It is observed that achieving small uncertainties in $L_{1,A}$ will be challenging, and (sub)percent-level precision in the two-nucleon spectra and matrix elements is essential in reducing the uncertainty on this LEC compared to the existing constraints. On the other hand, the short-distance coupling of the neutrinoless double-$β$ decay, $g_ν^{NN}$, is shown to be less sensitive to uncertainties on both LQCD energies and the matrix element, and can likely be constrained with percent-level precision in the upcoming LQCD calculations.",

      "summary": "The quark chromoelectric dipole (qCEDM) operator is a CP-violating operator describing, at hadronic energies, beyond-the-standard-model contributions to the electric dipole moment of particles with nonzero spin. In this paper we define renormalized dipole operators in a regularization-independent scheme using the gradient flow, and we perform the matching at one loop in perturbation theory to renormalized operators of the same and lower dimension in the more familiar MS scheme. We also determine the matching coefficients for the quark chromomagnetic dipole operator (qCMDM), which contributes, for example, to matrix elements relevant to CP-violating and CP-conserving kaon decays. The calculation provides a basis for future lattice QCD computations of hadronic matrix elements of the qCEDM and qCMDM operators.",

Started in late 2017 and intended as a full replacement of the previous single GPU lattice QCD code used by the HotQCD collaboration, our software has been developed into an extensive framework for lattice QCD calculations distributed on multiple GPUs over many compute nodes. The code is built on C++, CUDA, and MPI and leverages modern C++ language features to provide high-level data structures, objects, and algorithms that allow users to express lattice QCD calculations in an intuitive way without sacrificing performance. Implemented algorithms range from gradient flow, correlator measurements, and mixed precision conjugate gradient solvers all the way to full HISQ gauge field configuration generation using RHMC. After successful deployment in large-scale computing projects, we want to share the result of our efforts with the lattice QCD community by making it publicly available. In these proceedings, we will present some of the key features of our code, demonstrate its ease of use, and show benchmarks of performance critical kernels on state-of-the-art supercomputers.",

We study the chromoelectric and the chromomagnetic correlator in the deconfined phase of SU(3) gauge theory using Symanzik flow at two temperatures $1.5T_c$ and $10000 T_c$, with $T_c$ being the phase transition temperature. To control the lattice discretization errors and perform the continuum limit we use several temporal lattice extents $N_t=16,20,24$ and 28. We observe that the flow time dependence of the chromomagnetic correlator is quite different from chromoelectric correlator most likely due to the anomalous dimension of the former as has been pointed out recently in the literature.",

      "summary": "We review lattice results related to pion, kaon, $D$-meson, $B$-meson, and nucleon physics with the aim of making them easily accessible to the nuclear and particle physics communities. More specifically, we report on the determination of the light-quark masses, the form factor $f_+(0)$ arising in the semileptonic $K \\to π$ transition at zero momentum transfer, as well as the decay constant ratio $f_K/f_π$ and its consequences for the CKM matrix elements $V_{us}$ and $V_{ud}$. Furthermore, we describe the results obtained on the lattice for some of the low-energy constants of $SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R$ and $SU(3)_L\\times SU(3)_R$ Chiral Perturbation Theory. We review the determination of the $B_K$ parameter of neutral kaon mixing as well as the additional four $B$ parameters that arise in theories of physics beyond the Standard Model. For the heavy-quark sector, we provide results for $m_c$ and $m_b$ as well as those for the decay constants, form factors, and mixing parameters of charmed and bottom mesons and baryons. These are the heavy-quark quantities most relevant for the determination of CKM matrix elements and the global CKM unitarity-triangle fit. We review the status of lattice determinations of the strong coupling constant $α_s$. We consider nucleon matrix elements, and review the determinations of the axial, scalar and tensor bilinears, both isovector and flavor diagonal. Finally, in this review we have added a new section reviewing determinations of scale-setting quantities.",

From the perspective of an effective Lagrangian in the vicinity of the chiral transition, the Polyakov loop, $P$, is an energy-like observable, and $\\langle P\\rangle$ should hence scale like the energy density. Using $N_f=2+1$ HISQ configurations at finite lattice spacing, we show that near the chiral transition temperature, the scaling behavior of $\\langle P\\rangle$ and the heavy quark free energy $F_q$ is consistent with energy-like observables in the 3-$d$, O($N$) universality class. We extend this analysis to other Polyakov loop observables, including the response of the heavy quark free energy, $F_q$, to the baryon chemical potential, which is expected to scale like a specific heat.",

A complete determination of the momentum and angular momentum fractions carried by up, down, strange and glue inside the proton has been done with valence pion masses varying from 171 to 391 MeV. We have utilized fast Fourier transform on the stochastic-sandwich method for connected-insertion parts and the cluster-decomposition error reduction technique for disconnected-insertion parts has been used to reduce statistical errors. The full nonperturbative renormalization and mixing between the quark and glue operators are carried out. The final results are normalized with the momentum and angular momentum sum rules and reported at the physical valence pion mass at ${\\overline{\\rm {MS}}}\\, (μ= 2\\ {\\rm{GeV}})$. The renormalized momentum fractions for the quarks and glue are $\\langle x \\rangle^q = 0.491(20)(23)$ and $\\langle x \\rangle^g = 0.509(20)(23)$, respectively, and the renormalized total angular momentum fractions for quarks and glue are $2 J^q = 0.539(22)(44)$ and $2 J^g = 0.461(22)(44)$, respectively. The quark spin fraction is $Σ= 0.405(25)(37)$ from our previous work and the quark orbital angular momentum fraction is deduced from $2 L^q = 2 J^q - Σ$ to be $0.134(22)(44)$.",

      "summary": "We present a calculation of the scalar, vector, and tensor form factors for the pion and kaon in lattice QCD. We use an ensemble of two degenerate light, a strange and a charm quark ($N_f=2+1+1$) of maximally twisted mass fermions with clover improvement. The corresponding pion and kaon masses are about 265 MeV and 530 MeV, respectively. The calculation is done in both rest and boosted frames obtaining data for four-vector momentum transfer squared up to $-q^2=2.5$ GeV$^2$ for the pion and 3 GeV$^2$ for the kaon. The excited-states effects are studied by analyzing six values of the source-sink time separation for the rest frame ($1.12-2.23$ fm) and for four values for the boosted frame ($1.12-1.67$ fm). The lattice data are renormalized non-perturbatively and the results for the scheme- and scale-dependent scalar and tensor form factors are presented in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme at a scale of 2 GeV. We apply different parametrizations to describe $q^2$-dependence of the form factors to extract the scalar, vector, and tensor radii, as well as the tensor anomalous magnetic moment. We compare the pion and kaon form factors to study SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking effects. By combining the data for the vector and tensor form factors we also obtain the lowest moment of the densities of transversely polarized quarks in the impact parameter space. Finally, we give an estimate for the average transverse shift in the $y$ direction for polarized quarks in the $x$ direction.",

The finite-volume Lüscher approach is employed to determine the lowest few partial waves from ground- and excited-state energies computed from correlation matrices rotated in a single pivot using a generalized eigenvector solution. This analysis requires evaluating matrices of correlation functions between single- and two-hadron interpolating operators which are projected onto definite spatial momenta and finite-volume irreducible representations. The stochastic LapH method is used to estimate all needed quark propagators. Preliminary results are presented for $I=\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2}$ $Nπ$ amplitudes including the $Δ(1232)$ resonance and the $I=0$ $S$-wave amplitude with unit strangeness relevant for the $Λ(1405)$.",

Lattice QCD has the ability to make significant impact upon DUNE, beginning with computations of nucleon-neutrino interactions with weak currents. Nucleon amplitudes involving the axial form factor are part of the primary signal measurement process for DUNE, and precise calculations from LQCD can significantly reduce the uncertainty for inputs into Monte Carlo generators. Recent calculations of the nucleon axial charge have demonstrated that sub-percent precision is possible on this vital quantity. In these proceedings, we discuss preliminary results for the CalLat collaboration's calculation of the axial form factor of the nucleon. These computations are performed with Möbius domain wall valence quarks on HISQ sea quark ensembles generated by the MILC and CalLat collaborations. The results use a variety of ensembles including several at physical pion mass.",

Our calculation employs the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action for both sea and valence quarks and includes several ensembles with physical-mass up, down, strange, and charm quarks and lattice spacings ranging from $a\\approx0.15$ fm down to 0.06 fm. At most lattice spacings, an ensemble with physical-mass light quarks is included. The use of the highly improved action, combined with the MILC Collaboration's gauge ensembles with lattice spacings down to $a\\approx0.042$ fm, allows heavy valence quarks to be treated with the same discretization as the light and strange quarks. This unified treatment of the valence quarks allows (in some cases) for absolutely normalized currents, bypassing the need for perturbative matching, which has been a leading source of uncertainty in previous calculations of $B$-meson decay form factors by our collaboration. All preliminary form-factor results are blinded.",

The ability to calculate real-time quantities of strongly-correlated quantum systems is one of the most exciting applications that can easily reach beyond the capabilities of traditional classical hardware. Response functions of fermionic systems at moderate momenta and energies corresponding roughly to the Fermi energy of the system are a potential early application because the relevant operators are nearly local and the energies can be resolved in moderately short real time, reducing the spatial resolution and gate depth required.\n  This is particularly the case in quasielastic electron and neutrino scattering from nuclei, a topic of great interest in the nuclear and particle physics communities and directly related to experiments designed to probe neutrino properties. In this work we use current quantum hardware and error mitigation protocols to calculate response functions for a highly simplified nuclear model through calculations of a 2-point real time correlation function for a modified Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions with three distinguishable nucleons on four lattice sites.",

Our first project is to simulate QED in a constant (in space and time) external magnetic field on a euclidean space-time lattice using the Rational Hybrid Monte Carlo (RHMC) method. Observables we measure include the condensate $\\langle\\barψψ\\rangle$ and the effective electron action after integrating out the fermion fields. We look for evidence that the combined effect of the magnetic field and the electron-positron attraction from QED produces a non-zero condensate in the limit of zero electron mass, a non-perturbative effect analogous to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. Very preliminary evidence is that such a condensate exists, at least for strong external magnetic fields and unphysically large electric charge. In addition, we are storing field configurations to measure the expected distortions and screenings of the coulomb field of a charged particle due to the vacuum polarization asymmetries produced by the magnetic field. We hope also to measure the dynamical contribution to the electron mass produced by the same mechanism that produces a finite condensate in the zero input mass limit.",

We apply the pseudo-distribution approach, using a gauge ensemble with a lattice spacing of 0.094 fm and the light quark mass tuned to a pion mass of 358 MeV. We extract the transversity PDF from the analysis of the short-distance behavior of the Ioffe-time pseudo-distribution using the leading-twist next-to-leading order (NLO) matching coefficients calculated for transversity. We reconstruct the $x$-dependence of the transversity PDF through an expansion in a basis of Jacobi polynomials in order to reduce the PDF ansatz dependence. Within the limitations imposed by a heavier-than-physical pion mass and a fixed lattice spacing, we present a comparison of our estimate for the valence transversity PDF with the recent global fit results based on single transverse spin asymmetry. We find the intrinsic nucleon sea to be isospin symmetric with respect to transversity.",

      "summary": "Proton decay is a major prediction of Grand-Unified Theories (GUT) and its observation would indicate baryon number violation that is required for baryogenesis. Many decades of searching for proton decay have constrained its rate and ruled out some of the simplest GUT models. Apart from the baryon number-violating interactions, this rate also depends on transition amplitudes between the proton and mesons or leptons produced in the decay, which are matrix elements of three-quark operators. We report nonperturbative calculation of these matrix elements for the most studied two-body decay channels into a meson and antilepton done on a lattice with physical light and strange quark masses and lattice spacings $a\\approx0.14$ and 0.20 fm. We perform nonperturbative renormalization and excited state analysis to control associated systematic effects. Our results largely agree with previous lattice calculations done with heavier quark masses and thus remove ambiguity in ruling out some simple GUT theories due to quark mass dependence of hadron structure.",

In the large charge expansion, among the sectors with a fixed large value of $j = {\\rm max}(j_L,j_R)$, the leading sector has $|j_L-j_R| = 0$ and the sub-leading one has $|j_L-j_R| = 1$. Since Monte Carlo calculations at large $j$ become challenging in the traditional lattice formulation of the $O(4)$ model, a qubit regularized $O(4)$ lattice model was used recently to compute $D(j,j)$. Here we extend those calculations to the sub-leading sector. Our Monte Carlo results up to $j=20$ fit well to the form $D(j,j-1)-D(j) \\sim λ_{1/2}/\\sqrt{j} + λ_1/j + λ_{3/2}/j^{3/2}$, consistent with recent predictions of the large charge expansion. Taking into account systematic effects in our fitting procedures we estimate the two leading coefficients to be $λ_{1/2}=2.08(5)$, $λ_1=2.2(3)$.",

      "summary": "In these proceedings, we summarize the main results from the first-ever calculations of the chiral-even and chiral-odd twist-3 parton distributions, $g_T(x)$ and $h_L(x)$, of the proton from lattice QCD. We use an $N_f=2+1+1$ ensemble of maximally twisted mass fermions with a clover improvement. The lattice has a spatial extent of 3~fm, the lattice spacing is 0.093~fm, and the pion mass is $260$~MeV. The matrix elements are obtained with a source-sink time separation of 1.12~fm to control contamination from excited states. The calculation is based on the quasi-PDF approach and employs three values for the proton momentum: 0.83~GeV, 1.25~GeV, and 1.67~GeV. The lattice data are renormalized non-perturbatively using the RI$'$ scheme, and the final results are presented in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme at the scale of 2~GeV. Furthermore, we compute in the same setup the helicity, $g_1(x)$, and transversity, $h_1(x)$, distributions, which are used to compare $g_T(x)$ and $h_L(x)$ to their Wandzura-Wilczek approximations. For $h_L(x)$, we combine results for the isovector and isoscalar flavor combinations to disentangle the individual up- and down-quark contributions.",

We define the leading momentum-current multipoles, tensor monopole $τ$ ($T0$) and scalar quadrupole $\\hat σ^{ij}$ ($S2$) moments, relating the former to the so-called $D$-term in the literature. We calculate the momentum current distribution in hydrogen atom and its monopole moment in the basic unit of $τ_0 =\\hbar^2/4M$, showing that the sign of $D$-term has little to do with mechanical stability. The momentum current distribution also strongly modifies the static gravitational field inside hadrons.",

      "summary": "We propose a hybrid stochastic method for the tensor renormalization group (TRG) approach. TRG is known as a powerful tool to study the many-body systems and quantum field theory on the lattice. It is based on a low-rank approximation of the tensor using the truncated singular value decomposition (SVD), whose computational cost increases as the bond dimension increases, so that efficient cost reduction techniques are highly demanded. We use noise vectors for the low-rank approximation with the truncated SVD, by which the truncation error is replaced with a statistical error due to noise, and an error estimation could be improved. We test this method in the classical Ising model and observe a better accuracy than TRG. We also discuss a cross contamination issue in a multiple use of the same noise vectors, and to remove this systematic error we consider position-dependent noise vectors.",

The study consists of two parts: the first investigates the properties of Wilson line correlators in Coulomb gauge and compares to predictions of hard-thermal loop perturbation theory. As a second step we extract the spectral functions underlying the correlators using four conceptually different methods: spectral function fits, a HTL inspired fit for the correlation function, Padé rational approximation and the Bayesian BR spectral reconstruction. We find that our high statistics Euclidean lattice data are amenable to different hypotheses for the shapes of the spectral function and we compare the implications of each analysis method for the existence and properties of a well defined ground state spectral peak.",

      "summary": "The many-body entanglement between two finite (size-$d$) disjoint vacuum regions of non-interacting lattice scalar field theory in one spatial dimension -- a $(d_A \\times d_B)_{\\rm mixed}$ Gaussian continuous variable system -- is locally transformed into a tensor-product \"core\" of $(1_A \\times 1_B)_{\\rm mixed}$ entangled pairs. Accessible entanglement within these core pairs exhibits an exponential hierarchy, and as such identifies the structure of dominant region modes from which vacuum entanglement could be extracted into a spatially separated pair of quantum detectors. Beyond the core, remaining modes of the \"halo\" are determined to be AB-separable in isolation, as well as separable from the core. However, state preparation protocols that distribute entanglement in the form of $(1_A \\times 1_B)_{\\rm mixed}$ core pairs are found to require additional entanglement in the halo that is obscured by classical correlations. This inaccessible (bound) halo entanglement is found to mirror the accessible entanglement, but with a step behavior as the continuum is approached. It remains possible that alternate initialization protocols that do not utilize the exponential hierarchy of core-pair entanglement may require less inaccessible entanglement. Entanglement consolidation is expected to persist in higher dimensions and may aid classical and quantum simulations of asymptotically free gauge field theories, such as quantum chromodynamics.",

From this modification we obtain an upper bound in the cost that implies a cubic improvement with respect to the algorithm's error rate. Numerical evaluation of the costs also demonstrates an improvement. Moreover, with similar techniques, we detail an iterative projective measurement method for ground state preparation that gives an exponential improvement over previous bounds using QPEA. Numerical tests that confirm the expected scaling behavior are also obtained. For these numerical tests we have used a Lattice Thirring model as testing ground. Using well-known perturbation theory results, we also show how to more appropriately estimate the cost scaling with respect to state error instead of evolution operator error.",

Dynamical time evolution of quantum fields is a challenge that is beyond the capabilities of classical computing, but it can teach us important lessons about the fundamental fabric of space and time. Whether we may answer scientific questions of interest using near-term quantum computing hardware is an open question that requires a detailed simulation study of quantum noise. Here we present a large scale simulation study powered by a multi-node implementation of qsim using the Google Cloud Platform. We additionally employ newly-developed GPU capabilities in qsim and show how Tensor Processing Units -- Application-specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) specialized for Machine Learning -- may be used to dramatically speed up the simulation of large quantum circuits. We demonstrate the use of high performance cloud computing for simulating $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum field theories on system sizes up to 36 qubits. We find this lattice size is not able to simulate our problem and observable combination with sufficient accuracy, implying more challenging observables of interest for this theory are likely beyond the reach of classical computation using exact circuit simulation.",

We investigate this class of clock models in 2D using Monte Carlo (MC) and tensor renormalization group (TRG) methods, and we find that the model with noninteger $q$ has a crossover and a second-order phase transition. We also define an extended-$O(2)$ model (with a parameter $γ$) that reduces to the $XY$ model when $γ=0$ and to the extended $q$-state clock model when $γ\\to\\infty$, and we begin to outline the phase diagram of this model. These models with noninteger $q$ serve as a testbed to study symmetry breaking in situations corresponding to quantum simulators where experimental parameters can be tuned continuously.",

      "title": "Anderson Metal-to-Critical Transition in QCD",
      "summary": "A picture of thermal QCD phase change based on the analogy with metal-to-insulator transition of Anderson type was proposed in the past. In this picture, a low-$T$ thermal state is akin to a metal with deeply infrared (IR) Dirac modes abundant and extended, while a high-$T$ state is akin to an insulator with IR modes depleted and localized below a mobility edge $λ_{\\text A} > 0$. Here we argue that, while $λ_{\\text A}$ exists in QCD, a high-$T$ state is not an insulator in such an analogy. Rather, it is a critical state arising due to a new singular mobility edge at $λ_{\\text IR}=0$. This new mobility edge appears upon the transition into the recently proposed IR phase. As a key part of such a metal-to-critical scenario, we present evidence using pure-glue QCD that deeply infrared Dirac modes in the IR phase extend to arbitrarily long distances. This is consistent with our previous suggestion that the IR phase supports scale invariance in the infrared. We discuss the role of Anderson-like aspects in this thermal regime and emphasize that the combination of gauge field topology and disorder plays a key role in shaping its IR physics. Our conclusions are conveyed by the structure of Dirac spectral non-analyticities.",

Early calculations employed Lüscher's formula for extracting these quantities at lowest order. As the calculations become more ambitious, higher-order relations are required. In this study we derive higher-order quantization conditions and introduce a method to transparently cross-check our results. This is an important step given the involved derivations of these formulae. We derive quantization conditions up to $\\ell=5$ partial waves in both cubic and elongated geometries, and for states with zero and non-zero total momentum.

The low-energy behavior of the Compton scattering amplitude is matched to matrix elements of current-current correlation functions on the lattice.

      "summary": "For theories plagued with a sign problem at finite density, a Taylor expansion in the chemical potential is frequently used for lattice gauge theory based computations of the equation of state. Recently, in arXiv:2106.03165, a new resummation scheme was proposed for such an expansion that resums contributions of correlation functions of conserved currents to all orders in the chemical potential. Here, we study the efficacy of this resummation scheme using a solvable low energy model, namely the mean-field quark-meson model. After adapting the scheme for a mean-field analysis, we confront the results of this scheme with the direct solution of the model at finite density as well as compare with results from Taylor expansions. We study to what extent the two methods capture the analytical properties of the equation of state in the complex chemical potential plane. As expected, the Taylor expansion breaks down as soon as the baryon chemical potential reaches the radius of convergence defined by the Yang-Lee edge singularity. Encouragingly, the resummation not only captures the location of the Yang-Lee edge singularity accurately, but is also able to describe the equation of state for larger chemical potentials beyond the location of the edge singularity for a wide range of temperatures.",

The mass shift of $1S$ and $1P$ charmonia owing to the charm quark annihilation effect can be investigated directly in a manner of unitary theory. The distillation method is adopted to treat the charm quark annihilation diagrams at a very precise level. For $1S$ charmonia, the charm quark annihilation effect almost does not change the $J/ψ$ mass, but lifts the $η_c$ mass by approximately 3-4 MeV. For $1P$ charmonia, this effect results in positive mass shifts of approximately 1 MeV for $χ_{c1}$ and $h_c$, but decreases the $χ_{c2}$ mass by approximately 3 MeV. We have not obtain a reliable result for the mass shift of $χ_{c0}$. In addition, it is observed that the spin averaged mass of the spin-triplet $1P$ charmonia is in a good agreement with the $h_c$, as expected by the non-relativistic quark model and measured by experiments.",

Our results confirm general expectations from the dual string/M-theory picture for strong coupling. In particular, we observe the confined phase in the BFSS matrix model, which is a nontrivial consequence of the M-theory picture. We suggest that these models provide us with an ideal framework to study the Schwarzschild black hole, M-theory, and furthermore, the parameter region of the phase transition between type IIA superstring theory and M-theory. A detailed study of M-theory via lattice Monte Carlo simulations of the D0-brane matrix model might be doable with much smaller computational resources than previously expected.",

      "summary": "We report on a preliminary study of static quark anti-quark potential at non-zero temperature in $2+1$ flavor QCD using $96^3\\times N_τ$ lattices with lattice spacing $a=0.028$fm, physical strange quark mass and light quark masses corresponding to pion mass of about $300$ MeV. We use $N_τ=32,~24,~20$ and $16$ that correspond to temperature range $T=220-441$ MeV. The in order to obtain the potential we calculate the Wilson line correlator in Coulomb gauge with additional HYP smearing to reduce the noise at large quark anti-quark separations. We apply $0$, $5$ and $10$ steps of HYP smearing to ensure that there is no physical effect from over-smearing. At the two highest temperatures we also consider a noise reduction technique that is based on an interpolation in the spatial separation between the static quark and anti-quark.",

      "summary": "It is not possible, using standard lattice techniques in Euclidean space, to calculate the complete fermionic spectrum of a quantum field theory. Algorithms running on quantum computers have the potential to access the theory with real-time evolution, enabling a direct computation. As a testing ground we consider the 1 + 1-dimensional Schwinger model with the presence of a θ term using a staggered fermions discretization. We study the convergence properties of two different algorithms - adiabatic evolution and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm - with an emphasis on their cost in terms of CNOT gates. This is crucial to understand the feasibility of these algorithms, because calculations on near-term quantum devices depend on their rapid convergence. We also propose a blocked algorithm that has the first indications of a better scaling behavior with the dimensionality of the problem.",

      "summary": "Nuclei make up the majority of the visible matter in the Universe; obtaining a first principles description of the nuclear properties and interactions between nuclei directly from the underlying theory of the strong interaction, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), is one of the main goals of the nuclear physics community. Although the theory was established nearly fifty years ago, the complexities of QCD at low energies precludes analytical solutions of the simplest hadronic systems, let alone the features of the nuclear forces. In this thesis we follow the lattice QCD approach, according to which QCD is solved non-perturbatively in a discretized space-time via large-scale numerical calculations. Specifically, the interactions between two octet baryons, with strangeness ranging from 0 to -4, are studied at low energies with larger-than-physical quark masses, and the low-energy coefficients in pionless effective field thepry relevant for two-baryon interactions, including those responsible for SU(3) flavor-symmetry breaking, are constrained.",

This approach allows one to determine the continuous RG $β$ function, an alternative to the finite-volume step-scaling function. Unlike step-scaling, where the lattice must provide the only scale, the continuous $β$ function can be used even in the confining regime where dimensional transmutation generates a physical scale $Λ_{\\mathrm{QCD}}$. We investigate a pure gauge SU(3) Yang-Mills theory both in the deconfined and the confined phases and determine the continuous $β$ function in both. Our investigation is based on simulations done with the tree-level Symanzik gauge action on lattice volumes up to $32^4$ using both Wilson and Zeuthen gradient flow (GF) measurements. Our continuum GF $β$ function exhibits considerably slower running than the universal 2-loop perturbative prediction, and at strong couplings it runs even slower than the 1-loop prediction.",

      "summary": "Bosonic quantum field theories, even when regularized using a finite lattice, possess an infinite dimensional Hilbert space and, therefore, cannot be simulated in quantum computers with a finite number of qubits. A truncation of the Hilbert space is then needed and the physical results are obtained after a double limit: one to remove the truncation and another to remove the regulator (the continuum limit). A simpler alternative is to find a model with a finite dimensional Hilbert space belonging to the same universality class as the continuum model (a \"qubitization\"), so only the space continuum limit is required. A qubitization of the $1+1$ dimensional asymptotically free $O(3)$ nonlinear $σ$-model based on ideas of non-commutative geometry was previously proposed arXiv:1903.06577 and, in this paper, we provide evidence that it reproduces the physics of the $σ$-model both in the infrared and the ultraviolet regimes.",

Importantly, interactions in our model are not only invariant under $\\SU(2)$ symmetries of spin and charge like the Hubbard model, but they also preserve an Ising like electron spin-charge flip symmetry. From unbiased fermion bag Monte Carlo simulations with up to 2304 sites, we show that the massive fermion phase spontaneously breaks this Ising symmetry, picking either anti-ferromagnetism or superconductivity and that the transition at which both orders are simultaneously quantum critical, belongs to a new \"chiral spin-charge symmetric\" universality class. We explain our observations using effective potential and renormalization group calculations within the framework of a continuum field theory.",

      "summary": "As fermions are added to a lattice gauge theory, one is driven to stronger bare coupling in order to maintain the same renormalized coupling. Stronger bare couplings are usually associated with larger gauge fluctuations, leading to larger cutoff effects and more expensive simulations. In theories with many light fermions, sometimes the desired physical region cannot be reached before encountering a phase boundary. We show that these undesired effects can be reduced by adding Pauli--Villars fields. We reach significantly larger renormalized couplings while at the same time damping short-distance fluctuations of the gauge field. This may allow for controlled continuum extrapolations from large lattice spacings.",

      "summary": "We consider hierarchically implemented quantum error correction (HI-QEC), in which the fidelities of logical qubits are differentially optimized to enhance the capabilities of quantum devices in scientific applications. By employing qubit representations that propagate hierarchies in simulated systems to those in logical qubit noise sensitivities, heterogeneity in the distribution of physical-to-logical qubits can be systematically structured. For concreteness, we estimate HI-QEC's impact on surface code resources in computing low-energy observables to fixed precision, finding up to $\\sim 60\\%$ reductions in qubit requirements plausible in early error corrected simulations. Hierarchical qubit maps are also possible without error correction in qubit and qudit systems where fidelities are non-uniform, either unintentionally or by design. Hierarchical optimizations are another element in the co-design process of quantum simulations for nuclear and particle physics.",

We describe progress that has been made over the previous five years. This includes studies of the equation of state and equilibrium susceptibilities, the development of suitable initial state models, progress in constructing a hydrodynamic framework that includes fluctuations and anomalous transport effects, as well as the development of freezeout prescriptions and hadronic transport models.

For each case the required quantum resources scale linearly or as low-degree polynomials in $n=\\log N$.

      "title": "A variational study of two-nucleon systems with lattice QCD",
      "summary": "The low-energy spectrum and scattering of two-nucleon systems are studied with lattice quantum chromodynamics using a variational approach. A wide range of interpolating operators are used: dibaryon operators built from products of plane-wave nucleons, hexaquark operators built from six localized quarks, and quasi-local operators inspired by two-nucleon bound-state wavefunctions in low-energy effective theories. Sparsening techniques are used to compute the timeslice-to-all quark propagators required to form correlation-function matrices using products of these operators. Projection of these matrices onto irreducible representations of the cubic group, including spin-orbit coupling, is detailed. Variational methods are applied to constrain the low-energy spectra of two-nucleon systems in a single finite volume with quark masses corresponding to a pion mass of 806 MeV. Results for S- and D-wave phase shifts in the isospin singlet and triplet channels are obtained under the assumption that partial-wave mixing is negligible. Tests of interpolating-operator dependence are used to investigate the reliability of the energy spectra obtained and highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of variational methods. These studies and comparisons to previous studies using the same gauge-field ensemble demonstrate that interpolating-operator dependence can lead to significant effects on the two-nucleon energy spectra obtained using both variational and non-variational methods, including missing energy levels and other discrepancies. While this study is inconclusive regarding the presence of two-nucleon bound states at this quark mass, it provides robust upper bounds on two-nucleon energy levels that can be improved in future calculations using additional interpolating operators and is therefore a step toward reliable nuclear spectroscopy from the underlying Standard Model of particle physics.",

We compute the matrix elements with non-local operators containing a Wilson line. The calculation implements the Breit symmetric frame. The proton momenta are chosen as $0.83,\\,1.25,\\,1.67$ GeV, and the values of the momentum transfer squared are $0.69,\\,1.02$ GeV$^2$. These combinations include cases with zero and nonzero skewness. The calculation is performed using one ensemble of two degenerate-mass light, a strange and a charm quark of maximally twisted mass fermions with a clover term. The lattice results are renormalized non-perturbatively and finally matched to the light-cone GPDs using one-loop perturbation theory within the framework of large momentum effective theory. The final GPDs are given in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme at a scale of 2 GeV. In addition to the individual GPDs, we form the combination of the transversity GPDs that is related to the transverse spin structure of the proton. Finally, we extract the lowest two moments of GPDs and draw a number of important qualitative conclusions.",

      "summary": "State-of-the-art lattice QCD studies of hot and dense strongly interacting matter currently rely on extrapolation from zero or imaginary chemical potentials. The ill-posedness of numerical analytic continuation puts severe limitations on the reliability of such methods. Here we use the more direct sign reweighting method to perform lattice QCD simulation of the QCD chiral transition at finite real baryon density on phenomenologically relevant lattices. This method does not require analytic continuation and avoids the overlap problem associated with generic reweighting schemes, so has only statistical but no uncontrolled systematic uncertainties for a fixed lattice setup. This opens up a new window to study hot and dense strongly interacting matter from first principles. We perform simulations up to a baryochemical potential-temperature ratio of $μ_B/T=2.5$ covering most of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan range in the chemical potential. We also clarify the connection of the approach to the more traditional phase reweighting method.",

This requires the introduction of gauge-fixing into the action, in order to isolate the asymptotically decoupled Fourier modes. In this article, we present our approach and results from a gauge-fixed Fourier-accelerated hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm, using an action that softly fixes the gauge links to Landau gauge. We compare the autocorrelation times with those of the pure hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. We work on a small-volume lattice at weak coupling. We present preliminary results and obstacles from working with periodic boundary conditions, and then we present results from using fixed, equilibrated boundary links to avoid $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ and other topological barriers and to anticipate applying a similar acceleration to many small cells in a large, physically-relevant lattice volume.",

The hadronic tensor is calculated on lattice QCD and then combined with an analytic photon propagator, and the mass splitting is calculated with exponentially-suppressed finite volume errors. The calculation is performed using six gauge ensembles generated with $2+1$-flavor domain wall fermions, and five ensembles are at the physical pion mass. Both Feynman and Coulomb gauge are adopted in the calculation and result in a good agreement when the lattice spacing approaches zero. After performing the continuum extrapolation and examining the residual finite-volume effects, we obtain the pion mass splitting $Δm_π= 4.534(42)(43)~\\mathrm{MeV}$, which agrees well with experimental measurements.",

      "summary": "Trapped-ion quantum simulators, in analog and digital modes, are considered a primary candidate to achieve quantum advantage in quantum simulation and quantum computation. The underlying controlled ion-laser interactions induce all-to-all two-spin interactions via the collective modes of motion through Cirac-Zoller or Molmer-Sorensen schemes, leading to effective two-spin Hamiltonians, as well as two-qubit entangling gates. In this work, the Molmer-Sorensen scheme is extended to induce three-spin interactions via tailored first- and second-order spin-motion couplings. The scheme enables engineering single-, two-, and three-spin interactions, and can be tuned via an enhanced protocol to simulate purely three-spin dynamics. Analytical results for the effective evolution are presented, along with detailed numerical simulations of the full dynamics to support the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed scheme for near-term applications. With a focus on quantum simulation, the advantage of a direct analog implementation of three-spin dynamics is demonstrated via the example of matter-gauge interactions in the U(1) lattice gauge theory within the quantum link model. The mapping of degrees of freedom and strategies for scaling the three-spin scheme to larger systems, are detailed, along with a discussion of the expected outcome of the simulation of the quantum link model given realistic fidelities in the upcoming experiments. The applications of the three-spin scheme go beyond the lattice gauge theory example studied here and include studies of static and dynamical phase diagrams of strongly interacting condensed-matter systems modeled by two- and three-spin Hamiltonians.",

This framework allows us to largely suppress spurious oscillations and other common reconstruction artifacts by specifying generic magnitude and length scale parameters in the kernel function. The Euclidean propagator data are taken from lattice simulations with domain wall fermions at the physical point. For the infrared and ultraviolet extensions of the lattice propagators as well as the low-frequency asymptotics of the ghost spectral function, we utilize results from functional computations in Yang-Mills theory and QCD. This further reduces the systematic error significantly. Our numerical results are compared against a direct real-time functional computation of the ghost and an earlier reconstruction of the gluon in Yang-Mills theory. The systematic approach presented in this work offers a promising route towards unveiling real-time properties of QCD.",

We have performed the first lattice-QCD computation of the form factors governing $Λ_c$ semileptonic decays to a $Λ^*$ resonance: the $Λ^*(1520)$, which has negative parity and spin $3/2$. Here we present the resulting Standard-Model predictions of the $Λ_c\\toΛ^*(1520)\\ell^+ν_\\ell$ differential and integrated decay rates as well as angular observables. Furthermore, by combining the recent BESIII measurement of the $Λ_c \\to X e^+ ν_e$ inclusive semipositronic branching fraction [Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 251801 (2018)] with lattice-QCD predictions of the $Λ_c \\to Λe^+ ν_e$, $Λ_c \\to n e^+ ν_e$, and $Λ_c \\to Λ^*(1520) e^+ ν_e$ decay rates, we obtain an upper limit on the sum of the branching fractions to all other semipositronic final states. In particular, this upper limit constrains the $Λ_c\\toΛ^*(1405)e^+ ν_e$ branching fraction to be very small, which may be another hint for a molecular structure of the $Λ^*(1405)$.",

In this work, we show our lattice exploration of the twist-3 PDFs $g_T(x)$, and $h_L(x)$. We also present our preliminary results on the twist-3 GPD $\\tilde{G}_2(x)$. We use the quasi-distribution approach to connect the lattice-extracted matrix elements, renormalized in the RI/MOM scheme, to light-cone distributions, applying the matching procedure that we developed in parallel. We also calculate the twist-2 counterparts of $g_T(x)$ and $h_L(x)$, i.e. $g_1(x)$, and $h_1(x)$, and test the Wandzura-Wilczek approximation.",

      "summary": "We carry out the first lattice QCD derivation of the mixing energy and the mixing angle of the pseudoscalar charmonium and glueball on two gauge ensembles with $N_f=2$ degenerate dynamical charm quarks. The mixing energy is determined to be $49(6)$ MeV on the near physical charm ensemble, which seems insensitive to charm quark mass. By the assumption that $X(2370)$ is predominantly a pseudoscalar glueball, the mixing angle is determined to be approximately $4.6(6)^\\circ$, which results in a $+3.9(9)$ MeV mass shift of the ground state pseudoscalar charmonium. In the mean time, the mixing can raise the total width of the pseudoscalar charmonium by 7.2(8) MeV, which explains to some extent the relative large total width of the $η_c$ meson. As a result, the branching fraction of $η_c\\to γγ$ can be understood in this $c\\bar{c}$-glueball mixing framework. On the other hand, the possible discrepancy of the theoretical predictions and the experimental results of the partial width of $J/ψ\\toγη_c$ cannot be alleviated by the $c\\bar{c}$-glueball mixing picture yet, which demands future precise experimental measurements of this partial width.",

The kernel is extracted at transverse momentum scales in the range 400 MeV $< q_T < 1.7$ GeV in a calculation with dynamical fermions and quark masses corresponding to a larger-than-physical pion mass, $m_π=538(1)$ MeV. It is found that different approaches to extract the Collins-Soper kernel from the same underlying lattice QCD matrix elements yield significantly different results and uncertainty estimates, revealing that power corrections, such as those associated with higher-twist effects, and perturbative matching between quasi and light-cone beam functions, cannot be neglected.",

      "summary": "The lattice compact Abelian Higgs model is a non-perturbative regularized formulation of low-energy scalar quantum electrodynamics. In 1+1 dimensions, this model can be quantum simulated using a ladder-shaped optical lattice with Rydberg-dressed atoms (Zhang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 223201). In this setup, one spatial dimension is used to carry the angular momentum of the quantum rotors. One can use truncations corresponding to spin-2 and spin-1 to build local Hilbert spaces associated with the links of the lattice. We argue that ladder-shaped configurable arrays of Rydberg atoms can be used for the same purpose. We make concrete proposals involving two and three Rydberg atoms to build one local spin-1 space (a qutrit). We show that the building blocks of the Hamiltonian calculations are models with one and two spins. We compare target and simulators using perturbative and numerical methods. The two-atom setup provides an easily controllable simulator of the one-spin model while the three-atom setup involves solving nonlinear equations. This could be tested with current technology. We argue that near-term technology could be used to quantum simulate models with two or more spins.",

However, the practical extraction of GPDs for this channel requires a deconvolution procedure, whose feasibility has been disputed. We provide a practical approach to this problem based on a next-to-leading order analysis and a careful study of evolution effects, by exhibiting shadow GPDs with arbitrarily small imprints on DVCS observables at current and future experimental facilities. This shows that DVCS alone will not allow for a model independent extraction of GPDs and a multi-channel analysis is required for this purpose.",

We, furthermore, use these results to characterize thermal conditions in the vicinity of the pseudo-critical line of the chiral transition in QCD.

For example, physical $s$-wave pion scattering can be decomposed into $I=0$ and $2$ amplitudes, while, in a partially-quenched extension, the larger symmetry group implies that there are more than two independent scattering amplitudes. It has been proposed that the finite-volume quantization condition of Lüscher holds for the correlation functions associated with each of the two-particle amplitudes that arise in partially-quenched theories. Using partially-quenched chiral perturbation theory, we show that this proposal fails for those correlation functions for which the corresponding one-loop amplitudes do not satisfy $s$-wave unitarity. For partially-quenched amplitudes that, while being unphysical, do satisfy one-loop $s$-wave unitarity, we argue that the proposal is plausible. Implications for previous work are discussed.",

We carry out the lattice calculation on a $32^3\\times 64$ ensemble with a pion mass of $358$ MeV and lattice spacing of $0.094$ fm. We construct the nucleon interpolating fields using the distillation technique, flow the gauge fields using the gradient flow, and solve the summed generalized eigenvalue problem to determine the glounic matrix elements. Combining these techniques allows us to provide a statistically well-controlled Ioffe-time distribution and unpolarized gluon PDF. We obtain the flow time independent reduced Ioffe-time pseudo-distribution, and calculate the light-cone Ioffe-time distribution and unpolarized gluon distribution function in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme at $μ= 2$ GeV, neglecting the mixing of the gluon operator with the quark singlet sector. Finally, we compare our results to phenomenological determinations.",

      "summary": "A topological $θ$-term in gauge theories, including quantum chromodynamics in 3+1 dimensions, gives rise to a sign problem that makes classical Monte Carlo simulations impractical. Quantum simulations are not subject to such sign problems and are a promising approach to studying these theories in the future. In the near term, it is interesting to study simpler models that retain some of the physical phenomena of interest and their implementation on quantum hardware. For example, dimensionally-reducing gauge theories on small spatial tori produces quantum mechanical models which, despite being relatively simple to solve, retain interesting vacuum and symmetry structures from the parent gauge theories. Here we consider quantum mechanical particle-on-a-circle models, related by dimensional reduction to the 1+1d Schwinger model, that possess a $θ$-term and realize an 't Hooft anomaly or global inconsistency at $θ= π$. These models also exhibit the related phenomena of spontaneous symmetry breaking and instanton-anti-instanton interference in real time. We propose an experimental scheme for the real-time simulation of a particle on a circle with a $θ$-term and a $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ potential using a synthetic dimension encoded in a Rydberg atom. Simulating the Rydberg atom with realistic experimental parameters, we demonstrate that the essential physics can be well-captured by the experiment, with expected behavior in the tunneling rate as a function of $θ$. Similar phenomena and observables can also arise in more complex quantum mechanical models connected to higher-dimensional nonabelian gauge theories by dimensional reduction.",

In the WV-HMC algorithm, the configuration space is a continuous accumulation (worldvolume) of deformed integration surfaces, and sample averages are considered for various subregions in the worldvolume. We prove that, if a sample in the worldvolume is generated as a Markov chain, then the subsample in the subregion can also be regarded as a Markov chain. This ensures the application of the standard statistical techniques to the WV-HMC algorithm. We particularly investigate the autocorrelation times for the Markov chains in various subregions, and find that there is a linear relation between the probability to be in a subregion and the autocorrelation time for the corresponding subsample. We numerically confirm this scaling law for a chiral random matrix model.",

      "summary": "We apply the Distillation spatial smearing program to the extraction of the unpolarized isovector valence PDF of the nucleon. The improved volume sampling and control of excited-states afforded by distillation leads to a dramatically improved determination of the requisite Ioffe-time Pseudo-distribution (pITD). The impact of higher-twist effects is subsequently explored by extending the Wilson line length present in our non-local operators to one half the spatial extent of the lattice ensemble considered. The valence PDF is extracted by analyzing both the matched Ioffe-time Distribution (ITD), as well as a direct matching of the pITD to the PDF. Through development of a novel prescription to obtain the PDF from the pITD, we establish a concerning deviation of the pITD from the expected DGLAP evolution of the pseudo-PDF. The presence of DGLAP evolution is observed once more following introduction of a discretization term into the PDF extractions. Observance and correction of this discrepancy further highlights the utility of distillation in such structure studies.",

Pursuing the vision articulated by Feynman, a concerted effort across many areas of research and development is introducing prototypical digital quantum devices into the computing ecosystem available to domain scientists. Through interactions with these early quantum devices, the abstract vision of exploring classically-intractable quantum systems is evolving toward becoming a tangible reality. Beyond catalyzing these technological advances, entanglement is enabling parallel progress as a diagnostic for quantum correlations and as an organizational tool, both guiding improved understanding of quantum many-body systems and quantum field theories defining and emerging from the Standard Model. From the perspective of three domain science theorists, this article compiles thoughts about the interface on entanglement, complexity, and quantum simulation in an effort to contextualize recent NISQ-era progress with the scientific objectives of nuclear and high-energy physics.",

We derive and validate quantization conditions up to $\\ell=5$ partial waves in both cubic and elongated geometries, and for states zero and non-zero total momentum.

We argue that this scheme has several advantages that make it particularly suited for precision determinations of the strong coupling, among them translational invariance, an analytic expansion in the coupling and a reduced memory footprint with respect to standard simulations on symmetric lattices, allowing for a more efficient use of current GPU clusters. We test this scheme numerically with a determination of the $Λ$ parameter in the $SU(3)$ pure gauge theory. We show that the use of an asymmetric geometry has no significant impact in the size of scaling violations, obtaining a value $Λ_{\\overline{MS}} \\sqrt{8 t_0} =0.603(17)$ in good agreement with the existing literature. The role of topology freezing, that is relevant for the determination of the coupling in this particular scheme and for large $N$ applications, is discussed in detail.",

      "summary": "We report the first-ever calculation of the isovector flavor combination of the chiral-odd twist-3 parton distribution $h_L(x)$ for the proton from lattice QCD. We employ gauge configurations with two degenerate light, a strange and a charm quark ($N_f=2+1+1$) of maximally twisted mass fermions with a clover improvement. The lattice has a spatial extent of 3 fm and lattice spacing of 0.093 fm. The values of the quark masses lead to a pion mass of $260$ MeV. We use a source-sink time separation of 1.12 fm to control contamination from excited states. Our calculation is based on the quasi-distribution approach, with three values for the proton momentum: 0.83 GeV, 1.25 GeV, and 1.67 GeV. The lattice data are renormalized non-perturbatively using the RI$'$ scheme, and the final result for $h_L(x)$ is presented in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme at the scale of 2 GeV. Furthermore, we compute in the same setup the transversity distribution, $h_1(x)$, which allows us, in particular, to compare $h_L(x)$ to its Wandzura-Wilczek approximation. We also combine results for the isovector and isoscalar flavor combinations to disentangle the individual quark contributions for $h_1(x)$ and $h_L(x)$, and address the Wandzura-Wilczek approximation in that case as well.",

      "summary": "With advances in quantum computing, new opportunities arise to tackle challenging calculations in quantum field theory. We show that trotterized time-evolution operators can be related by analytic continuation to the Euclidean transfer matrix on an anisotropic lattice. In turn, trotterization entails renormalization of the temporal and spatial lattice spacings. Based on the tools of Euclidean lattice field theory, we propose two schemes to determine Minkowski lattice spacings, using Euclidean data and thereby overcoming the demands on quantum resources for scale setting. In addition, we advocate using a fixed-anisotropy approach to the continuum to reduce both circuit depth and number of independent simulations. We demonstrate these methods with Qiskit noiseless simulators for a $2+1$D discrete non-Abelian $D_4$ gauge theory with two spatial plaquettes.",

Introducing a fermion mass into such a theory will explicitly break both scale invariance and chiral symmetry, leading to confinement and a spectrum of bound states. We argue that in such a theory, the pion scattering length diverges in the limit of zero fermion mass, in sharp contrast to QCD-like theories where the chiral Lagrangian predicts a vanishing scattering length. We demonstrate this effect both with a simple dimensional argument, and in a generalized linear sigma model which we argue can be used to describe the interactions of light scalar and pseudoscalar bound states in the soft limit of a mass-deformed infrared-conformal theory. As a result, lattice calculations of pion scattering lengths could be a sensitive probe for infrared scale invariance in gauge-fermion theories.",

To this end, we present a nonperturbative lattice calculation of s-wave scattering of Goldstone bosons in the maximal-isospin channel in SU(3) gauge theory with $N_f=8$ light, degenerate flavors. The scattering phase shift is measured both for different values of the underlying fermion mass and for different values of the scattering momentum. We examine the effect of a light flavor-singlet scalar (reported in earlier studies) on Goldstone boson scattering, employing a dilaton effective field theory (EFT) at the tree level. The EFT gives a good description of the scattering data, insofar as the magnitude of deviations between EFT and lattice data are no larger than the expected size of next-to-leading order corrections in the EFT.",

We investigate the SU(3) flavor symmetry and show that there is up to 10\\% breaking for the axial and up to 50\\% for the induced pseudoscalar form factors. By fitting the $Q^2$-dependence, we determined the corresponding root mean square radii. The pseudoscalar coupling of the $η$ meson and the nucleon is found to be $g_{ηNN}=3.7(1.0)(0.7)$, and the Goldberger-Treiman discrepancy for the octet combination about 50\\%.",

After applying an appropriate renormalization procedure and the removal of significant higher-twist contamination, we obtain the intrinsic soft function that is comparable to the one-loop perturbative result at large external momentum. The determination of the nonperturbative soft function from first principles is crucial to sharpen our understanding of the processes with small transverse momentum such as the Drell-Yan production and the semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering.

      "summary": "We study two- and three-meson systems composed either of pions or kaons at maximal isospin using Monte Carlo simulations of lattice QCD. Utilizing the stochastic LapH method, we are able to determine hundreds of two- and three-particle energy levels, in nine different momentum frames, with high precision. We fit these levels using the relativistic finite-volume formalism based on a generic effective field theory in order to determine the parameters of the two- and three-particle K-matrices. We find that the statistical precision of our spectra is sufficient to probe not only the dominant $s$-wave interactions, but also those in $d$ waves. In particular, we determine for the first time a term in the three-particle K-matrix that contains two-particle $d$ waves. We use three $N_f=2+1$ CLS ensembles with pion masses of $200$, $280$, and $340\\;$MeV. This allows us to study the chiral dependence of the scattering observables, and compare to the expectations of chiral perturbation theory.",

      "summary": "Light-front wave functions play a fundamental role in the light-front quantization approach to QCD and hadron structure. However, a naive implementation of the light-front quantization suffers from various subtleties including the well-known zero-mode problem, the associated rapidity divergences which mixes ultra-violet divergences with infrared physics, as well as breaking of spatial rotational symmetry. We advocate that the light-front quantization should be viewed as an effective theory in which small $k^+$ modes have been effectively ``integrated out'', with an infinite number of renormalization constants. Instead of solving light-front quantized field theories directly, we make the large momentum expansion of the equal-time Euclidean correlation functions in instant quantization as an effective way to systematically calculate light-front correlations, including the light-front wave function amplitudes. This large-momentum effective theory accomplishes an effective light-front quantization through lattice QCD calculations. We demonstrate our approach using an example of a pseudo-scalar meson wave function.",

In the first step, we determine the confidence-intervals of the leading-twist $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ Wilson coefficients, $C_n(μ^2 z^2)$, of the equal-time bilocal quark bilinear, given the lattice QCD matrix element of Ioffe-time distribution for a particular hadron $H$ as well as the prior knowledge of the valence PDF, $f(x,μ)$ of the hadron $H$ determined via global fit from the experimental data. In the next step, we apply the numerically estimated $C_n$ in the lattice QCD determinations of the valence PDFs of other hadrons, and for the zero-skewness generalized parton distribution (GPD) of the same hadron $H$ at non-zero momentum transfers. Our proposal still assumes the dominance of leading-twist terms, but it offers a pragmatic alternative to the usage of perturbative Wilson coefficients and their associated higher-loop uncertainties such as the effect of all-order logarithms at larger sub-Fermi quark-antiquark separations $z$.",

      "summary": "Taylor expansion in powers of baryon chemical potential ($μ_B$) is an oft-used method in lattice QCD to compute QCD thermodynamics for $μ_B>0$. Based only upon the few known lowest order Taylor coefficients, it is difficult to discern the range of $μ_B$ where such an expansion around $μ_B=0$ can be trusted. We introduce a resummation scheme for the Taylor expansion of the QCD equation of state in $μ_B$ that is based on the $n$-point correlation functions of the conserved current ($D_n$). The method resums the contributions of the first $N$ correlation function $D_1,\\dots,D_N$ to the Taylor expansion of the QCD partition function to all orders in $μ_B$. We show that the resummed partition function is an approximation to the reweighted partition function at $μ_B\\ne0$. We apply the proposed approach to high-statistics lattice QCD calculations using 2+1 flavors of Highly Improved Staggered Quarks with physical quark masses on $32^3\\times8$ lattices and for temperatures $T\\approx145$-176 MeV. We demonstrate that, as opposed to the Taylor expansion, the resummed version not only leads to improved convergence but also reflects the zeros of the resummed partition function and severity of the sign problem, leading to its eventual breakdown. We also provide a generalization of our scheme to include resummation of powers of temperature and quark masses in addition to $μ_B$, and show that the alternative expansion scheme of [S. Borsányi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 232001 (2021).] is a special case of this generalized resummation.",

The low-energy behavior of Compton scattering amplitude is matched to matrix elements of current-current correlation functions on the lattice. Working in momentum space, formulas for electric polarizability ($α_E$) and magnetic polarizability ($β_M$) are derived for both charged pion and proton. Lattice four-point correlation functions are constructed from quark and gluon fields to be used in Monte-Carlo simulations. The content of the functions is assessed in detail and specific prescriptions are given to isolate the polarizabilities. The connected quark-line diagrams can be done today as a small lattice project. The disconnected diagrams are more challenging but are within reach of dedicated resources for medium to large lattice projects. We also draw attention to the potential of four-point functions as a multi-purpose tool for hadron structure.",

      "summary": "In this work, we study probing for the more general problem of computing the trace of a permutation of $A^{-1}$, say $PA^{-1}$. The motivation comes from Lattice QCD where we need to construct \"disconnected diagrams\" to extract flavor-separated Generalized Parton functions. In Lattice QCD, where the matrix has a 4D toroidal lattice structure, these non-local operators correspond to a $PA^{-1}$ where $P$ is the permutation relating to some displacement $\\vec{p}$ in one or more dimensions. We focus on a single dimension displacement ($p$) but our methods are general. We show that probing on $A^k$ or $(PA)^k$ do not annihilate the largest magnitude elements. To resolve this issue, our displacement-based probing works on $PA^k$ using a new coloring scheme that works directly on appropriately displaced neighborhoods on the lattice. We prove lower bounds on the number of colors needed, and study the effect of this scheme on variance reduction, both theoretically and experimentally on a real-world Lattice QCD calculation. We achieve orders of magnitude speedup over the unprobed or the naively probed methods.",

      "summary": "We present the first unquenched lattice-QCD calculation of the form factors for the decay $B\\rightarrow D^\\ast\\ellν$ at nonzero recoil. Our analysis includes 15 MILC ensembles with $N_f=2+1$ flavors of asqtad sea quarks, with a strange quark mass close to its physical mass. The lattice spacings range from $a\\approx 0.15$ fm down to $0.045$ fm, while the ratio between the light- and the strange-quark masses ranges from 0.05 to 0.4. The valence $b$ and $c$ quarks are treated using the Wilson-clover action with the Fermilab interpretation, whereas the light sector employs asqtad staggered fermions. We extrapolate our results to the physical point in the continuum limit using rooted staggered heavy-light meson chiral perturbation theory. Then we apply a model-independent parametrization to extend the form factors to the full kinematic range. With this parametrization we perform a joint lattice-QCD/experiment fit using several experimental datasets to determine the CKM matrix element $|V_{cb}|$. We obtain $\\left|V_{cb}\\right| = (38.40 \\pm 0.68_{\\textrm{th}} \\pm 0.34_{\\textrm{exp}} \\pm 0.18_{\\textrm{EM}})\\times 10^{-3}$. The first error is theoretical, the second comes from experiment and the last one includes electromagnetic and electroweak uncertainties, with an overall $χ^2\\text{/dof} = 126/84$, which illustrates the tensions between the experimental data sets, and between theory and experiment. This result is in agreement with previous exclusive determinations, but the tension with the inclusive determination remains. Finally, we integrate the differential decay rate obtained solely from lattice data to predict $R(D^\\ast) = 0.265 \\pm 0.013$, which confirms the current tension between theory and experiment.",

Inter alia, we are employing the summation Generalized Eigenvalue Problem (sGEVP) technique in order to optimize our control over the excited state contamination which can be one of the most serious systematic errors in this type of calculations. A crucial novel ingredient of our analysis is the parameterization of systematic errors using Jacobi polynomials to characterize and remove both lattice spacing and higher twist contaminations, as well as the leading twist distribution.

The most serious systematic effect in lattice calculations of nucleon correlation functions is the contribution of excited states. We estimate these using chiral perturbation theory ($χ$PT), and show that the leading contribution to the isoscalar scalar charge comes from N$π$ and N$ππ$ states. Therefore, we carry out two analyses of lattice data to remove excited-state contamination, the standard one and a new one including N$π$ and N$ππ$ states. We find that the standard analysis gives $σ_{πN} = 41.9(4.9)$ MeV, consistent with previous lattice calculations, while our preferred $χ$PT-motivated analysis gives $σ_{πN} = 59.6(7.4)$ MeV, which is consistent with phenomenological values obtained using $π$N scattering data. Our data on one physical pion mass ensemble was crucial for exposing this difference, therefore, calculations on additional physical mass ensembles are needed to confirm our result and resolve the tension between lattice QCD and phenomenology.",

We derive the formalism necessary to extract two- and three-particle infinite-volume scattering amplitudes from the spectrum of such systems in finite volume. We use a relativistic formalism based on an all-orders diagrammatic analysis in generic effective field theory, adopting the methodology used recently to study the case of three nondegenerate particles. We present both a direct derivation, and also a cross-check based on an appropriate limit and projection of the fully nondegenerate formalism. We also work out the threshold expansions for the three-particle K matrix that will be needed in practical applications, both for systems with two identical particles plus a third, and also for the fully nondegenerate theory.",

      "title": "Clock model interpolation and symmetry breaking in O(2) models",
      "summary": "Motivated by recent attempts to quantum simulate lattice models with continuous Abelian symmetries using discrete approximations, we define an extended-O(2) model by adding a $γ\\cos(q\\varphi)$ term to the ordinary O(2) model with angular values restricted to a $2π$ interval. In the $γ\\rightarrow \\infty$ limit, the model becomes an extended $q$-state clock model that reduces to the ordinary $q$-state clock model when $q$ is an integer and otherwise is a continuation of the clock model for noninteger $q$. By shifting the $2π$ integration interval, the number of angles selected can change discontinuously and two cases need to be considered. What we call case $1$ has one more angle than what we call case $2$. We investigate this class of clock models in two space-time dimensions using Monte Carlo and tensor renormalization group methods. Both the specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility show a double-peak structure for fractional $q$. In case $1$, the small-$β$ peak is associated with a crossover, and the large-$β$ peak is associated with an Ising critical point, while both peaks are crossovers in case $2$. When $q$ is close to an integer by an amount $Δq$ and the system is close to the small-$β$ Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, the system has a magnetic susceptibility that scales as $\\sim 1 / (Δq)^{1 - 1/δ'}$ with $δ'$ estimates consistent with the magnetic critical exponent $δ= 15$. The crossover peak and the Ising critical point move to Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition points with the same power-law scaling. A phase diagram for this model in the $(β, q)$ plane is sketched. These results are possibly relevant for configurable Rydberg-atom arrays where the interpolations among phases with discrete symmetries can be achieved by varying continuously the distances among atoms and the detuning frequency.",

      "summary": "Bottomonium states are key probes for experimental studies of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in high-energy nuclear collisions. Theoretical models of bottomonium productions in high-energy nuclear collisions rely on the in-medium interactions between the bottom and antibottom quarks. The latter can be characterized by the temperature ($T$) dependent potential, with real ($V_R(T,r)$) and imaginary ($V_I(T,r)$) parts, as a function of the spatial separation ($r$). Recently, the masses and thermal widths of up to $3S$ and $2P$ bottomonium states in QGP were calculated using lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD). Starting from these LQCD results and through a novel application of deep neural network, here, we obtain $V_R(T,r)$ and $V_I(T,r)$ in a model-independent fashion. The temperature dependence of $V_R(T,r)$ was found to be very mild between $T\\approx0-334$~MeV. For $T=151-334$~MeV, $V_I(T,r)$ shows a rapid increase with $T$ and $r$, which is much larger than the perturbation-theory-based expectations.",

We confirm that a novel contribution naturally arises as a part of the proton mass, which we call the quantum anomalous energy (QAE). We discuss the QAE origins in both lattice and dimensional regularizations and demonstrate its role as a scheme-and-scale independent component in the mass decomposition. We further argue that QAE role in the proton mass resembles a dynamical Higgs mechanism, in which the anomalous scale symmetry breaking field generates mass scales through its vacuum condensate, as well as its static and dynamical responses to the valence quarks. We demonstrate some of our points in two simpler but closely related quantum field theories, namely the 1+1 dimensional non-linear sigma model in which QAE is non-perturbative and scheme-independent, and QED where the anomalous energy effect is perturbative calculable.",

Presently the primary theoretical tool with which one can study such reactions is lattice QCD, which is defined in a finite spacetime volume. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of implementing existing finite-volume formalism in realistic lattice QCD calculation of reactions in which a stable hadron can transition to one of several two-hadron channels under the action of an external current. We provide a conceptual description of the coupled-channel transition formalism, a practical roadmap for carrying out a calculation, and an illustration of the approach using synthetic data for two non-trivial resonant toy models. The results provide a proof-of-principle that such reactions can indeed be constrained using modern-day lattice QCD calculations, motivating explicit computation in the near future.",

      "summary": "The background magnetic-field formalism of Lattice QCD has been used recently to calculate the magnetic polarizability of the charged pion. These $n_f = 2 + 1$ numerical simulations are electro-quenched, such that the virtual sea-quarks of the QCD vacuum do not interact with the background field. To understand the impact of this, we draw on partially quenched chiral perturbation theory. In this case, the leading term proportional to $1/M_π$ arises at tree level from $\\mathcal{L}_4$. To describe the results from lattice QCD, while maintaining the exact leading terms of chiral perturbation theory, we introduce a Padé approximant designed to reproduce the slow variation observed in the lattice QCD results. Two-loop contributions are introduced to assess the systematic uncertainty associated with higher-order terms of the expansion. Upon extrapolation, the magnetic polarizability of the charged pion at the physical pion mass is found to be $β_{π^\\pm}=-1.70\\,(14)_{\\rm stat}(25)_{\\rm syst}\\times 10^{-4}$ fm$^3$, in good agreement with the recent experimental measurement.",

      "summary": "Quantum field theories are the cornerstones of modern physics, providing relativistic and quantum mechanical descriptions of physical systems at the most fundamental level. Simulating real-time dynamics within these theories remains elusive in classical computing. This provides a unique opportunity for quantum simulators, which hold the promise of revolutionizing our simulation capabilities. Trapped-ion systems are successful quantum-simulator platforms for quantum many-body physics and can operate in digital, or gate-based, and analog modes. Inspired by the progress in proposing and realizing quantum simulations of a number of relativistic quantum field theories using trapped-ion systems, and by the hybrid analog-digital proposals for simulating interacting boson-fermion models, we propose hybrid analog-digital quantum simulations of selected quantum field theories, taking recent developments to the next level. On one hand, the semi-digital nature of this proposal offers more flexibility in engineering generic model interactions compared with a fully-analog approach. On the other hand, encoding the bosonic fields onto the phonon degrees of freedom of the trapped-ion system allows a more efficient usage of simulator resources, and a more natural implementation of intrinsic quantum operations in such platforms. This opens up new ways for simulating complex dynamics of e.g., Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories, by combining the benefits of digital and analog schemes.",

      "summary": "Energy levels are investigated for two charged particles possessing an attractive, momentum-independent, zero-range interaction in a uniform magnetic field. A transcendental equation governs the spectrum, which is characterized by a collective Landau-level quantum number incorporating both center-of-mass and relative degrees of freedom. Results are obtained for a system of one charged and one neutral particle, with the interaction chosen to produce a bound state in vanishing magnetic field. Beyond deriving the weak-field expansion of the energy levels, we focus on non-perturbative aspects. In the strong-field limit, or equivalently for a system in the unitary limit, a single bound level with universal binding energy exists. By contrast, excited states are resonances that disappear into the continuum as the magnetic field is raised beyond critical values. A hyperbola is derived that approximates the number of bound levels as a function of the field strength remarkably well.",

      "summary": "The O(2) model in Euclidean space-time is the zero-gauge-coupling limit of the compact scalar quantum electrodynamics. We obtain a dual representation of it called the charge representation. We study the quantum phase transition in the charge representation with a truncation to ``spin $S$,\" where the quantum numbers have an absolute value less than or equal to $S$. The charge representation preserves the gapless-to-gapped phase transition even for the smallest spin truncation $S = 1$. The phase transition for $S = 1$ is an infinite-order Gaussian transition with the same critical exponents $δ$ and $η$ as the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, while there are true BKT transitions for $S \\ge 2$. The essential singularity in the correlation length for $S = 1$ is different from that for $S \\ge 2$. The exponential convergence of the phase-transition point is studied in both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations. We discuss the effects of replacing the truncated $\\hat{U}^{\\pm} = \\exp(\\pm i \\hatθ)$ operators by the spin ladder operators $\\hat{S}^{\\pm}$ in the Hamiltonian. The marginal operators vanish at the Gaussian transition point for $S = 1$, which allows us to extract the $η$ exponent with high accuracy.",

Correctly including the boundary \\textit{snake} terms, the preconditioner is implemented in the QUDA framework, where it is found that utilizing kernel fusion and the tensor cores on NVIDIA GPUs is necessary to achieve a sufficiently performant preconditioner. A reduced-dimension (reduced-$L_s$) strategy is also proposed and tested for the preconditioner. We find the method achieves lower time to solution than regular CG at high node count despite the additional local computational requirements from the preconditioner. This method could be useful for supercomputers with more on-node flops and memory bandwidth than inter-node communication bandwidth.",

      "summary": "Excited state contamination remains one of the most challenging sources of systematic uncertainty to control in lattice QCD calculations of nucleon matrix elements and form factors: early time separations are contaminated by excited states and late times suffer from an exponentially bad signal-to-noise problem. High-statistics calculations at large time separations $\\gtrsim1$ fm are commonly used to combat these issues. In this work, focusing on $g_A$, we explore the alternative strategy of utilizing a large number of relatively low-statistics calculations at short to medium time separations (0.2--1 fm), combined with a multi-state analysis. On an ensemble with a pion mass of approximately 310 MeV and a lattice spacing of approximately 0.09 fm, we find this provides a more robust and economical method of quantifying and controlling the excited state systematic uncertainty. A quantitative separation of various types of excited states enables the identification of the transition matrix elements as the dominant contamination. The excited state contamination of the Feynman-Hellmann correlation function is found to reduce to the 1% level at approximately 1 fm while for the more standard three-point functions, this does not occur until after 2 fm. Critical to our findings is the use of a global minimization, rather than fixing the spectrum from the two-point functions and using them as input to the three-point analysis. We find that the ground state parameters determined in such a global analysis are stable against variations in the excited state model, the number of excited states, and the truncation of early-time or late-time numerical data.",

Based on a next-to-leading order analysis and a careful study of evolution effects, we exhibit non-trivial generalised parton distributions with arbitrarily small imprints on deeply virtual Compton scattering observables. This means that in practice the reconstruction of generalised parton distributions from measurements, known as the deconvolution problem, does not possess a unique solution for this channel. In this Letter we discuss the consequences on the extraction of generalised parton distributions from data and advocate for a multi-channel analysis.",

We use one ensemble of gauge configurations with two degenerate light, a strange and a charm quark ($N_f=2+1+1$) of maximally twisted mass fermions with clover improvement. The ensemble reproduces a pion mass $\\sim260$ MeV, and a kaon mass $\\sim530$ MeV. Excited-states contamination is evaluated using four values of the source-sink time separation within the range of $1.12-1.67$ fm. We use an operator that is free of mixing, and apply a multiplicative renormalization function calculated non-perturbatively. Our results are converted to the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme and evolved at a scale of 2 GeV, using three-loop expressions in perturbation theory. The final values are $\\langle x^3 \\rangle_π^{u^+}=0.024(18)_{\\rm stat}(2)_{\\rm syst}$, $\\langle x^3 \\rangle_K^{u^+}=0.035(6)_{\\rm stat}(3)_{\\rm syst}$, and $\\langle x^3 \\rangle_K^{s^+}=0.075(5)_{\\rm stat}(1)_{\\rm syst}$, where the systematic error is the uncertainty due to excited state contamination.\n  We combine $\\langle x^3 \\rangle$ with the two lower moments to obtain the ratios $\\langle x^3 \\rangle/\\langle x \\rangle$ and $\\langle x^3 \\rangle/\\langle x^2 \\rangle$, as well as ratios between the pion and kaon moments. In addition, we reconstruct the $x$-dependence of the pion and kaon PDFs via 2- and 3-parameter fits to our results. We find that the reconstruction is feasible and that our lattice data favor a large $x$-dependence that falls as $(1-x)^2$ for both the pion and kaon PDFs. We integrate the reconstructed PDFs to extract the higher moments with $4\\leq n\\leq 6$. Finally, we compare the pion and kaon PDFs, as well as the ratios of their moments, to address the effect of SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking.",

The mass decomposition in terms of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor is renormalization group invariant. The decomposition of the rest energy from the Hamiltonian and the gravitational form factors are scheme and scale dependent. The separation of the energy-momentum tensor into the traceless part which is composed of the quark and glue parton momentum fractions and the trace part has the minimum scheme dependence.\n  We identify the glue part of the trace anomaly $\\langle H_β\\rangle $ as the vacuum energy from the glue condensate in the vacuum. From the metric term of the gravitational form factors, which is the stress part of the stress-energy-momentum tensor, we find that the trace part of the rest energy, dominated by $\\langle H_β\\rangle$, gives a {\\it constant} restoring pressure which balances that from the traceless part of the Hamiltonian to confine the hadron, much like the cosmological constant Einstein introduced for a static universe. From a lattice calculation of $\\langle H_β\\rangle$ in the charmonium, we deduce the associated string tension which turns out to be in good agreement with that from a Cornell potential which fits the charmonium spectrum.",

These results support our recent study of direct CP violation in $K\\toππ$ decay \\cite{Abbott:2020hxn}, improving our earlier 2015 calculation \\cite{Bai:2015nea}. The phase shifts are determined for both stationary and moving $ππ$ systems, at three ($I=0$) and four ($I=2$) different total momenta. We implement several $ππ$ interpolating operators including a scalar bilinear \"$σ$\" operator and paired single-pion bilinear operators with the constituent pions carrying various relative momenta. Several techniques, including correlated fitting and a bootstrap determination of p-values have been used to refine the results and a comparison with the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) method is given. A detailed systematic error analysis is performed which allows phase shift results to be presented at a fixed energy.",

      "summary": "We show that long-distance quantum correlations probe short-distance physics. Two disjoint regions of the latticized, massless scalar field vacuum are numerically demonstrated to become separable at distances beyond the negativity sphere, which extends to infinity in the continuum limit. The size of this quantum coherent volume is determined by the highest momentum mode supported in the identical regions, each of diameter $d$. More generally, effective field theories (EFTs), describing a system up to a given momentum scale $Λ$, are expected to share this feature -- entanglement between regions of the vacuum depends upon the UV-completion beyond a separation proportional to $Λ$. Through calculations extended to three-dimensions, the magnitude of the negativity at which entanglement becomes sensitive to UV physics in an EFT (lattice or otherwise) is conjectured to scale as $\\sim e^{-Λd}$, independent of the number of spatial dimensions. It is concluded that two-region vacuum entanglement at increasing separations depends upon the structure of the theory at increasing momentum scales. This phenomenon may be manifest in perturbative QCD processes.",

Similar to the high-energy limit, the production amplitude can be factorized in terms of gluonic Generalized Parton Distributions and the quarkonium distribution amplitude. At the threshold, the threshold kinematics has a large skewness parameter $ξ$, leading to the dominance of the spin-2 contribution over higher-spin twist-2 operators. Thus threshold production data are useful to extract the gluonic gravitational form factors, allowing studying the gluonic contributions to the quantum anomalous energy, mass radius, spin and mechanical pressure in the proton. We use the recent GlueX data on the $J/ψ$ photoproduction to illustrate the potential physics impact from the high-precision data from future JLab 12 GeV and EIC physics program.",

We use a scalar function method to account for the momentum dependence of the decay amplitude and adopt the infinite volume reconstruction method to reduce the systematic errors such as the temporal truncation effects and the finite-volume effects. We then perform a four-body phase-space integral to obtain the decay width. The only remaining technical problem is the possible power-law finite-volume effects associated with the process of $K\\toππ\\ellν_\\ell\\to \\ellν_\\ell \\ell'^+ \\ell'^-$, where the intermediate state involves multiple hadrons. In this work, we use a gauge ensemble of twisted mass fermion with a pion mass $m_π=352$ MeV and a nearly-physical kaon mass. At this kinematics, the $ππ$ in the intermediate state cannot be on shell simultaneously as $2m_π>m_K$ and the finite-volume effects associated with $ππ$ state are exponentially suppressed. Using the developed methods mentioned above, we calculate the branching ratios for four channels of $K\\to \\ellν_\\ell\\ell'^+ \\ell'^-$, and obtain the results comparable to the experimental measurements and ChPT predictions.

As a result, an ab-initio determination of these objects is highly desirable. In this paper we present theoretical details for the calculation of the PDFs and LCDAs using a heavy-quark operator product expansion method. This strategy was proposed in a previous paper [Phys. Rev. D 73, 014501 (2006)] for computing higher moments of the PDFs using lattice QCD. Its central feature is the introduction of a fictitious, valence heavy quark. In the current article, we show that the operator product expansion (OPE) of the hadronic matrix element we study can also be expressed as the convolution of a perturbative matching kernel and the corresponding light-cone distribution, which in principle can be inverted to determine the parton momentum fraction dependence. Regarding the extraction of higher moments, this work also provides the one-loop Wilson coefficients in the OPE formulas for the unpolarized PDF, helicity PDF and pseudo-scalar meson LCDAs. Although these Wilson coefficients for the PDFs can be inferred from existing results in the literature, those for the LCDAs are new.",

      "summary": "We study the emergence of de Sitter space in Euclidean dynamical triangulations (EDT). Working within the semi-classical approximation, it is possible to relate the lattice parameters entering the simulations to the partition function of Euclidean quantum gravity. We verify that the EDT geometries behave semi-classically, and by making contact with the Hawking-Moss instanton solution for the Euclidean partition function, we show how to extract a value of the renormalized Newton's constant from the simulations. This value is consistent with that of our previous determination coming from the interaction of scalar particles. That the same universal constant appears in these two different sectors of the theory is a strong indication that EDT provides a viable formulation of quantum gravity.",

This procedure is convenient when using noisy quantum computers for which the asymptotic out-state behavior is unreachable. We demonstrate that the challenging Fourier transforms involved in the state preparation and measurements can be implemented in $1+1$ dimensions with current trapped ion devices and IBM quantum computers. We compare quantum computation of the time delays obtained in the one-particle quantum mechanics limit and the scalable quantum field theory formulation with accurate numerical results. We discuss the finite volume effects in the Wigner formula connecting time delays to phase shifts. The results reported involve two- and four-qubit calculations, and we discuss the possibility of larger scale computations in the near future.",

      "summary": "Gluon dressing of the light quarks within hadrons is very strong and extremely important in that it dynamically generates most of the observable mass through the breaking of chiral symmetry. The quark and gluon parton densities, $q(x)$ and $g(x)$, are necessarily interrelated since any gluon emission and absorption process, especially dressing of a quark, contributes to $g(x)$ and modifies $q(x)$. Guided by long-established results for the parton-in-parton distributions from a strict 1-loop perturbative analysis of a quark target, we extend the non-perturbative QCD approach based on the Rainbow-Ladder truncation of the Dyson-Schwinger equations to describe the interrelated valence $q_{\\rm v}(x)$ and the dressing-gluon $g(x)$ for a hadron at its intrinsic model scale. We employ the pion description from previous DSE work that accounted for the gluon-in-quark effect and introduce a simple model of the nucleon for exploratory purposes. We find typically \\mbox{$\\langle x \\rangle_g \\sim 0.20$} for both pion and nucleon at the model scale, and the valence quark helicity contributes 52\\% of nucleon spin. We deduce both $q_{\\rm v}(x)$ and $g(x)$ from 30 calculated Mellin moments, and after adopting existing data analysis results for $q_{\\rm sea}(x)$, we find that NLO scale evolution produces $g(x)$ in good agreement with existing data analysis results for the pion at 1.3 GeV and the nucleon at 5 GeV$^2$. At the scale 2 GeV typical of lattice-QCD calculations, we obtain \\mbox{$\\langle x \\rangle_g^{\\rm N} = 0.42$} in good agreement with 0.38 from the average of recent lattice-QCD calculations.",

      "summary": "It was recently proposed that there is a phase in thermal QCD (IR phase) at temperatures well above the chiral crossover, featuring elements of scale invariance in the infrared (IR). Here we study the effective spatial dimensions, $d_{IR}$, of Dirac low-energy modes in this phase, in the context of pure-glue QCD. Our $d_{IR}$ is based on the scaling of mode support toward thermodynamic limit, and hence is an IR probe. Ordinary extended modes, such as those at high energy, have $d_{IR}=3$. We find $d_{IR}<3$ in the spectral range whose lower edge coincides with $λ_{IR}=0$, the singularity of spectral density defining the IR phase, and the upper edge with $λ_A$, the previously identified Anderson-like non-analyticity. Details near $λ_{IR}$ are unexpected in that only exact zero modes are $d_{IR}=3$, while a thin spectral layer near zero is $d_{IR}=2$, followed by an extended layer of $d_{IR}=1$ modes. With only integer values appearing, $d_{IR}$ may have topological origin. We find similar structure at $λ_A$, and associate its adjacent thin layer ($d_{IR} >\\approx 2$) with Anderson-like criticality. Our analysis reveals the manner in which non-analyticities at $λ_{IR}$ and $λ_A$, originally identified in other quantities, appear in $d_{IR}(λ)$. This dimension structure may be important for understanding the near-perfect fluidity of the quark-gluon medium seen in accelerator experiments. The role of $λ_A$ in previously conjectured decoupling of IR component is explained.",

      "summary": "We present high statistics results for the isovector nucleon charges and form factors using seven ensembles of 2+1-flavor Wilson-clover fermions. The axial and pseudoscalar form factors obtained on each ensemble satisfy the PCAC relation once the lowest energy $Nπ$ excited state is included in the spectral decomposition of the correlation functions used for extracting the ground state matrix elements. Similarly, we find evidence that the $Nππ$ excited state contributes to the correlation functions with the vector current, consistent with the vector meson dominance model. The resulting form factors are consistent with the Kelly parameterization of the experimental electric and magnetic data. Our final estimates for the isovector charges are $g_{A}^{u-d} = 1.31(06)(05)_{sys}$, $g_{S}^{u-d} = 1.06(10)(06)_{sys}$, and $g_{T}^{u-d} = 0.95(05)(02)_{sys}$, where the first error is the overall analysis uncertainty and the second is an additional combined systematic uncertainty. The form factors yield: (i) the axial charge radius squared, ${\\langle r_A^2 \\rangle}^{u-d}=0.428(53)(30)_{sys}\\ {\\rm fm}^2$, (ii) the induced pseudoscalar charge, $g_P^\\ast=7.9(7)(9)_{sys}$, (iii) the pion-nucleon coupling $g_{π{\\rm NN}} = 12.4(1.2)$, (iv) the electric charge radius squared, ${\\langle r_E^2 \\rangle}^{u-d} = 0.85(12)(19)_{sys} \\ {\\rm fm}^2$, (v) the magnetic charge radius squared, ${\\langle r_M^2 \\rangle}^{u-d} = 0.71(19)(23)_{\\rm sys} \\ {\\rm fm}^2$, and (vi) the magnetic moment $μ^{u-d} = 4.15(22)(10)_{\\rm sys}$. All our results are consistent with phenomenological/experimental values but with larger errors. Lastly, we present a Padé parameterization of the axial, electric and magnetic form factors over the range $0.04< Q^2 <1$ GeV${}^2$ for phenomenological studies.",

      "summary": "We present a detailed comparison of several recent and new approaches to multigrid solver algorithms suitable for the solution of 5d chiral fermion actions such as Domain Wall fermions in the Shamir formulation, and also for the Partial Fraction and Continued Fraction overlap. Our focus is on the acceleration of gauge configuration sampling, and a compact nearest neighbour stencil is required to limit the calculational cost of obtaining a coarse operator. This necessitates the coarsening of a nearest neighbour operator to preserve sparsity in coarsened grids, unlike HDCG. We compare the approaches of HDCR and the Multigrid algorithm and also several new hybrid schemes. In this work we introduce a new recursive Chebyshev polynomial based setup scheme. We find that the HDCR approach, can both setup, and solve standard Shamir Domain Wall Fermions faster than a single solve with red-black preconditioned Conjugate Gradients on large volumes and for modern GPU systems such as the Summit supercomputer. This is promising for the acceleration of HMC, particularly if setup costs are shared across multiple Hasenbusch determinant factors. The setup scheme is likely generally applicable to other Fermion actions.",

Based on lattice QCD matrix elements of the quasi-PDF operator at lattice spacing $a$= 0.03 fm $\\sim$ 0.12 fm with clover and overlap valence quarks on staggered and domain-wall sea, we design a strategy to disentangle the divergent renormalization factors from finite physics matrix elements, which can be matched to a continuum scheme at short distance such as dimensional regularization and minimal subtraction. Our results indicate that the renormalization factors are universal in the hadron state matrix elements. Moreover, the physical matrix elements appear independent of the valence fermion formulations. These conclusions remain valid even with HYP smearing which reduces the statistical errors albeit reducing control of the renormalization procedure. Moreover, we find a large non-perturbative effect in the popular RI/MOM and ratio renormalization scheme, suggesting favor of the hybrid renormalization procedure proposed recently.",

Hoshina, Fujii, and Kikukawa (HFK) recently pointed out that applying the Wilson action discretization to continuum real-time gauge theory does not lead to this, or any other, unitary theory and proposed an alternate real-time lattice gauge theory action that does result in a unitary real-time transfer matrix. The character expansion defining the HFK action is divergent, and in this work we apply a path integral contour deformation to obtain a convergent representation for U(1) HFK path integrals suitable for numerical Monte Carlo calculations. We also introduce a class of real-time lattice gauge theory actions based on analytic continuation of the Euclidean heat-kernel action. Similar divergent sums are involved in defining these actions, but for one action in this class this divergence takes a particularly simple form, allowing construction of a path integral contour deformation that provides absolutely convergent representations for U(1) and SU(N) real-time lattice gauge theory path integrals. We perform proof-of-principle Monte Carlo calculations of real-time U(1) and SU(3) lattice gauge theory and verify that exact results for unitary time evolution of static quark-antiquark pairs in (1 + 1)D are reproduced.",

The vanishing of the gap from the strong coupling side with a Maxwell and a conformal measure is governed by a Gaussian exponent. Contrary to this result, the vanishing of the gap from the strong coupling side with a compact Thirring measure is not consistent with a Gaussian exponent. The low lying spectrum with a non-compact Thirring measure does not exhibit a simple non-monotonic behavior as a function of the lattice size on the weak coupling side.

      "summary": "The hadron resonance gas (HRG) model is often believed to correctly describe the confined phase of QCD. This assumption is the basis of many phenomenological works on QCD thermodynamics and of the analysis of hadron yields in relativistic heavy ion collisions. We use first-principle lattice simulations to calculate corrections to the ideal HRG. Namely, we determine the sub-leading fugacity expansion coefficients of the grand canonical free energy, receiving contributions from processes like kaon-kaon or baryon-baryon scattering. We achieve this goal by performing a two dimensional scan on the imaginary baryon number chemical potential ($μ_B$) - strangeness chemical potential ($μ_S$) plane, where the fugacity expansion coefficients become Fourier coefficients. We carry out a continuum limit estimation of these coefficients by performing lattice simulations with temporal extents of $N_τ=8,10,12$ using the 4stout-improved staggered action. We then use the truncated fugacity expansion to extrapolate ratios of baryon number and strangeness fluctuations and correlations to finite chemical potentials. Evaluating the fugacity expansion along the crossover line, we reproduce the trend seen in the experimental data on net-proton fluctuations by the STAR collaboration.",

The three ensembles have different lattice spacings and two of them have quark masses tuned to the physical point. The spectral density is determined up to $λ\\sim$100 MeV with subpercentage statistical uncertainty. We find that the density is close to a constant below $λ\\sim$ 20 MeV as predicted by chiral perturbative theory ($χ$PT), and then increases linearly due to the strange quark mass. By fitting to the next-to-leading order $χ$PT form and using the non-perturbative RI/MOM renormalization, the $\\rm SU(2)$ (keeping the strange quark mass at the physical point) and $\\rm SU(3)$ chiral condensates at $\\overline{\\textrm{MS}}$ 2 GeV are determined to be $Σ=(265.4(0.5)(4.2)\\ \\textrm{MeV})^3$ and $Σ_0=(234.3(0.5)(25.8)\\ \\textrm{MeV})^3$, respectively. The pion decay constants are also determined to be $F=84.1(1.9)(8.0)$ and $F_0=58.6(0.5)(10.0)$ MeV. The systematic errors are carefully estimated including the effects of fitting ranges and the uncertainty of low-energy constant $L_6$.

In this work we study the interaction of two scalar particles, and we show that in the appropriate limit we recover an interaction compatible with Newton's gravitational potential in four dimensions. Working in the quenched approximation, we calculate the binding energy of a two-particle bound state, and we study its dependence on the constituent particle mass in the non-relativistic limit. We find a binding energy compatible with what one expects for the ground state energy by solving the Schrödinger equation for Newton's potential. Agreement with this expectation is obtained in the infinite-volume, continuum limit of the lattice calculation, providing non-trivial evidence that EDT is in fact a theory of gravity in four dimensions. Furthermore, this result allows us to determine the lattice spacing within an EDT calculation for the first time, and we find that the various lattice spacings are smaller than the Planck length, suggesting that we can achieve a separation of scales and that there is no obstacle to taking a continuum limit. This lends further support to the asymptotic safety scenario for gravity.",

      "summary": "The axial charge of the triton is investigated using lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Extending previous work at heavier quark masses, calculations are performed using three ensembles of gauge field configurations generated with quark masses corresponding to a pion mass of 450 MeV. Finite-volume energy levels for the triton, as well as for the deuteron and diproton systems, are extracted from analysis of correlation functions computed on these ensembles, and the corresponding energies are extrapolated to infinite volume using finite-volume pionless effective field theory (FVEFT). It is found with high likelihood that there is a compact bound state with the quantum numbers of the triton at these quark masses. The axial current matrix elements are computed using background field techniques on one of the ensembles and FVEFT is again used to determine the axial charge of the proton and triton. A simple quark mass extrapolation of these results and earlier calculations at heavier quark masses leads to a value of the ratio of the triton to proton axial charges at the physical quark masses of $g_A^{^{3}{\\rm H}}/g_A^p=0.91\\substack{+0.07 \\\\ -0.09}$. This result is consistent with the ratio determined from experiment and prefers values less than unity (in which case the triton axial charge would be unmodified from that of the proton), thereby demonstrating that QCD can explain the modification of the axial charge of the triton.",

      "summary": "There are two mass generating mechanisms in the standard model of particle physics (SM). One is related to the Higgs boson and fairly well understood. The other is embedded in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the SM's strong interaction piece; and although responsible for emergence of the roughly 1 GeV mass scale that characterises the proton and hence all observable matter, the source and impacts of this emergent hadronic mass (EHM) remain puzzling. As bound states seeded by a valence-quark and -antiquark, pseudoscalar mesons present a simpler problem in quantum field theory than that associated with the nucleon. Consequently, there is a large array of robust predictions for pion and kaon properties whose empirical validation will provide a clear window onto many effects of both mass generating mechanisms and the constructive interference between them. This has now become significant because new-era experimental facilities, in operation, construction, or planning, are capable of conducting such tests and thereby contributing greatly to resolving the puzzles of EHM. These aspects of experiment, phenomenology, and theory, along with contemporary successes and challenges, are sketched herein, simultaneously highlighting the potential gains that can accrue from a coherent effort aimed at finally reaching an understanding of the character and structure of Nature's Nambu-Goldstone modes.",

      "summary": "Many present lattice QCD approaches to calculate the parton distribution functions (PDFs) rely on a factorization formula or effective theory expansion of certain Euclidean matrix elements in boosted hadron states. In the quasi- and pseudo-PDF methods, the matching coefficient in the factorization or expansion formula includes large logarithms near the threshold, which arise from the subtle interplay of collinear and soft divergences of an underlying 3D momentum distribution. We use the standard prescription to resum such logarithms in the Mellin-moment space at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, which also accounts for the DGLAP evolution, and we show that it can suppress the PDF at large $x$. Unlike the deep inelastic scattering and Drell-Yan cross sections, the resummation formula is away from the Landau pole. We then apply our formulation to reanalyze the recent lattice results for the pion valence PDF, and find that within the current data sensitivity, the effect of threshold resummation is marginal for the accessible moments and the PDF at large $x$.",

We define a family of contour deformations applicable to $SU(N)$ lattice gauge theory that can reduce sign and signal-to-noise problems associated with complex actions and complex observables. For observables, these contours can be used to define deformed observables with identical expectation value but different variance. As a proof-of-principle, we apply machine learning techniques to optimize the deformed observables associated with Wilson loops in two dimensional $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ gauge theory.

We present evidences that the first pion excitation in our lattice computation is a single particle state that is likely to be the finite volume realization of $π(1300)$. An analysis with reasonable priors result in better estimates of the excited state PDF and the moments, wherein we find evidence that the radial excitation of pion correlates with an almost two-fold increase in the momentum fraction of valence quarks.

This generalizes the Lellouch-Lüscher relation for two-particle decays and provides a strategy for extracting three-hadron decay amplitudes using lattice QCD. Unlike for two particles, even in the simplest approximation, one must solve integral equations to obtain the physical decay amplitude, a consequence of the nontrivial finite-state interactions. We first derive the result in a simplified theory with three identical particles, and then present the generalizations needed to study phenomenologically relevant three-pion decays. The specific processes we discuss are the CP-violating $K \\to 3π$ weak decay, the isospin-breaking $η\\to 3π$ QCD transition, and the electromagnetic $γ^*\\to 3π$ amplitudes that enter the calculation of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to muonic $g-2$.",

      "summary": "Maintaining local interactions in the quantum simulation of gauge field theories relegates most states in the Hilbert space to be unphysical -- theoretically benign, but experimentally difficult to avoid. Reformulations of the gauge fields can modify the ratio of physical to gauge-variant states often through classically preprocessing the Hilbert space and modifying the representation of the field on qubit degrees of freedom. This paper considers the implications of representing SU(3) Yang-Mills gauge theory on a lattice of irreducible representations in both a global basis of projected global quantum numbers and a local basis in which controlled-plaquette operators support efficient time evolution. Classically integrating over the internal gauge space at each vertex (e.g., color isospin and color hypercharge) significantly reduces both the qubit requirements and the dimensionality of the unphysical Hilbert space. Initiating tuning procedures that may inform future calculations at scale, the time evolution of one- and two-plaquettes are implemented on one of IBM's superconducting quantum devices, and early benchmark quantities are identified. The potential advantages of qudit environments, with either constrained 2D hexagonal or 1D nearest-neighbor internal state connectivity, are discussed for future large-scale calculations.",

      "summary": "We present a calculation of the contribution of the $Θ$-term to the neutron and proton electric dipole moments using seven 2+1+1-flavor HISQ ensembles. We also estimate the topological susceptibility for the 2+1+1 theory to be $χ_Q = (66(9)(4) \\rm MeV)^4$ in the continuum limit at $M_π= 135$ MeV. The calculation of the nucleon three-point function is done using Wilson-clover valence quarks. The CP-violating form factor $F_3$ is calculated by expanding in small $Θ$. We show that lattice artifacts introduce a term proportional to $a$ that does not vanish in the chiral limit, and we include this in our chiral-continuum fits. A chiral perturbation theory analysis shows that the $N(0) π(0)$ state should provide the leading excited state contribution, and we study the effect of such a state. Detailed analysis of the contributions to the neutron and proton electric dipole moment using two strategies for removing excited state contamination are presented. Using the excited state spectrum from fits to the two-point function, we find $d_n^Θ$ is small, $|d_n^Θ| \\lesssim 0.01 \\overline Θe$ fm, whereas for the proton we get $|d_p^Θ| \\sim 0.02 \\overline Θe$ fm. On the other hand, if the dominant excited-state contribution is from the $N π$ state, then $|d_n^Θ|$ could be as large as $0.05 \\overline Θe$ fm and $|d_p^Θ| \\sim 0.07 \\overline Θe$ fm. Our overall conclusion is that present lattice QCD calculations do not provide a reliable estimate of the contribution of the $Θ$-term to the nucleon electric dipole moments, and a factor of ten higher statistics data are needed to get better control over the systematics and possibly a $3σ$ result.",

For the heavier pion mass we find that the data is consistent with a constant contact term close to zero, whereas for the lighter mass we see a statistically significant energy dependence in tension with the prediction of leading order ChPT. Our results also suggest that with enough three-body energy levels, the two-body amplitude could be constrained.",

      "summary": "The smoothing procedure known as the gradient flow that suppresses ultraviolet fluctuations of gauge fields plays an important role in lattice gauge theory calculations. In particular, this procedure is often used for high-precision scale setting and renormalization of operators. The gradient flow equation is defined on the SU(3) manifold and therefore requires geometric, or structure-preserving, integration methods to obtain its numerical solutions. We examine the properties and origins of the three-stage third-order explicit Runge-Kutta Lie group integrator commonly used in the lattice gauge theory community, demonstrate its relation to 2N-storage classical Runge-Kutta methods and explore how its coefficients can be tuned for optimal performance in integrating the gradient flow. We also compare the performance of the tuned method with two third-order variable step size methods. Next, based on the recently established connection between low-storage Lie group integrators and classical 2N-storage Runge-Kutta methods, we study two fourth-order low-storage methods that provide a computationally efficient alternative to the commonly used third-order method while retaining the convenient iterative property of the latter. Finally, we demonstrate that almost no coding effort is needed to implement the low-storage Lie group methods into existing gradient flow codes.",

This is the counter part of the sum rule for the longitudinal spin of the proton derived by Jaffe and Manohar previously. We relate the partonic canonical orbital angular momentum densities to a new class of twist-3 generalized parton distribution functions which are potentially measurable in deep-virtual exclusive processes. We also discuss in detail an important technicality related to the transverse polarization in the infinite momentum frame, i.e., separation of intrinsic contributions from the extrinsic ones. We apply our finding to the transverse-space distributions of partons, angular momentum, and magnetic moment, respectively, in a transversely polarized proton.",

      "summary": "Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) claims that the major source of the nucleon invariant mass is not the Higgs mechanism but the trace anomaly in QCD energy momentum tensor. Although experimental and theoretical results support such conclusion, a direct demonstration is still absent. We present the first Lattice QCD calculation of the quark and gluon trace anomaly contributions to the hadron masses, using the overlap fermion on the 2+1 flavor dynamical Domain wall quark ensemble at $m_π=340$ MeV and lattice spacing $a=$0.1105 fm. The result shows that the gluon trace anomaly contributes to most of the nucleon mass, and the contribution in the pion state is smaller than that in others nearly by a factor $\\sim$10 since the gluon trace anomaly density inside pion is different from the other hadrons and the magnitude is much smaller. The gluon trace anomaly coefficient $β/g^3=-0.056(6)$ we obtained is consistent with its regularization independent leading order value $(-11+\\frac{2N_f}{3})/(4π)^2$ perfectly.",

      "summary": "Apart from the quark and gluon kinetic and potential energies, the nucleon mass includes a novel energy of pure quantum origin resulting from anomalous breaking of scale symmetry. We demonstrate the effects of this quantum anomalous energy (QAE) in QED, as well as in a toy 1+1 dimensional non-linear sigma model where it contributes non-perturbatively, in a way resembling the Higgs mechanism for the masses of matter particles in electro-weak theory. The QAE contribution to the nucleon mass can be explained using a similar mechanism, in terms of a dynamical response of the gluonic scalar field through Higgs-like couplings between the nucleon and scalar resonances. In addition, the QAE sets the scale for other energies in the nucleon through a relativistic virial theorem, and contributes a negative pressure to confine the colored quarks.",

      "summary": "We show that massless Kaehler-Dirac (KD) fermions exhibit a mixed gravitational anomaly involving an exact $U(1)$ symmetry which is unique to KD fields. Under this $U(1)$ symmetry the partition function transforms by a phase depending only on the Euler character of the background space. Compactifying flat space to a sphere we learn that the anomaly vanishes in odd dimensions but breaks the symmetry down to $Z_4$ in even dimensions. This $Z_4$ is sufficient to prohibit bilinear terms from arising in the fermionic effective action. Four fermion terms are allowed but require multiples of two flavors of KD field. In four dimensional flat space each KD field can be decomposed into four Dirac spinors and hence these anomaly constraints ensure that eight Dirac fermions or, for real representations, sixteen Majorana fermions are needed for a consistent interacting theory. These constraints on fermion number agree with known results for topological insulators and recent work on discrete anomalies rooted in the Dai-Freed theorem. Our work suggests that KD fermions may offer an independent path to understanding these constraints. Finally we point out that this anomaly survives intact under discretization and hence is relevant in understanding recent numerical results on lattice models possessing massive symmetric phases.",

The resonance occurs in elastic pion-nucleon scattering with $J^P=3/2^+$ in the isospin $I = 3/2$, $P$-wave channel. Our calculation is performed with $N_f=2+1$ flavors of clover fermions on a lattice with $L\\approx 2.8$ fm. The pion and nucleon masses are $m_π=255.4(1.6)$ MeV and $m_N=1073(5)$ MeV, and the strong decay channel $Δ\\rightarrow πN$ is found to be above the threshold. To thoroughly map out the energy-dependence of the nucleon-pion scattering amplitude, we compute the spectra in all relevant irreducible representations of the lattice symmetry groups for total momenta up to $\\vec{P}=\\frac{2π}{L}(1,1,1)$, including irreps that mix $S$ and $P$ waves. We perform global fits of the amplitude parameters to up to 21 energy levels, using a Breit-Wigner model for the $P$-wave phase shift and the effective-range expansion for the $S$-wave phase shift. From the location of the pole in the $P$-wave scattering amplitude, we obtain the resonance mass $m_Δ=1378(7)(9)$ MeV and the coupling $g_{Δ\\text{-}πN}=23.8(2.7)(0.9)$.",
