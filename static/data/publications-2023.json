      "title": "Symmetry Breaking in an Extended O(2) Model",
      "summary": "Motivated by attempts to quantum simulate lattice models with continuous Abelian symmetries using discrete approximations, we study an extended-O(2) model in two dimensions that differs from the ordinary O(2) model by the addition of an explicit symmetry breaking term $-h_q\\cos(q\\varphi)$. Its coupling $h_q$ allows to smoothly interpolate between the O(2) model ($h_q=0$) and a $q$-state clock model ($h_q\\rightarrow\\infty$). In the latter case, a $q$-state clock model can also be defined for noninteger values of $q$. Thus, such a limit can also be considered as an analytic continuation of an ordinary $q$-state clock model to noninteger $q$. In previous work, we established the phase diagram for noninteger $q$ in the infinite coupling limit ($h_q\\rightarrow\\infty$). We showed that there is a second-order phase transition at low temperature and a crossover at high temperature. In this work, we seek to establish the phase diagram at finite values of the coupling using Monte Carlo and tensor methods. We show that for noninteger $q$, the second-order phase transition at low temperature and crossover at high temperature persist to finite coupling. For integer $q=2,3,4$, we know there is a second-order phase transition at infinite coupling (i.e. the well-known clock models). At finite coupling, we find that the critical exponents for $q=3,4$ vary with the coupling, and for $q=4$ the transition may turn into a BKT transition at small coupling. We comment on the similarities and differences of the phase diagrams with those of quantum simulators of the Abelian-Higgs model based on ladder-shaped arrays of Rydberg atoms.",

      "title": "Phases of 2d massless QCD with qubit regularization",
      "summary": "We investigate the possibility of reproducing the continuum physics of 2d SU(N) gauge theory coupled to a single flavor of massless Dirac fermions using qubit regularization. The continuum theory is described by N free fermions in the ultraviolet (UV) and a coset Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model in the infrared (IR). In this work, we explore how well these features can be reproduced using the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian with a finite-dimensional link Hilbert space and a generalized Hubbard coupling. Using strong coupling expansions, we show that our model exhibits a gapped dimer phase and another phase described by a spin-chain. Furthermore, for N=2, using tensor network methods, we show that there is a second-order phase transition between these two phases. The critical theory at the transition can be understood as an SU(2)_1 WZW model, using which we determine the phase diagram of our model quantitatively. Using the confinement properties of the model we argue how the UV physics of free fermions could also emerge, but may require further modifications to our model.",

      "title": "Multipolynomial Monte Carlo Trace Estimation",
      "summary": "In lattice QCD the calculation of disconnected quark loops from the trace of the inverse quark matrix has large noise variance. A multilevel Monte Carlo method is proposed for this problem that uses different degree polynomials on a multilevel system. The polynomials are developed from the GMRES algorithm for solving linear equations. To reduce orthogonalization expense, the highest degree polynomial is a composite or double polynomial found with a polynomial preconditioned GMRES iteration. Matrix deflation is used in three different ways: in the Monte Carlo levels, in the main solves, and in the deflation of the highest level double polynomial. A numerical comparison with optimized Hutchinson is performed on a quenched \\(24^4\\) lattice. The results demonstrate that the new Multipolynomial Monte Carlo method can significantly improve the trace computation for matrices that have a difficult spectrum due to small eigenvalues.}",

We focused on strangeness-neutral, isospin-symmetric QCD matter, which closely resembles the situation encountered in heavy-ion collision experiments. Using this EoS, we present here results on various QCD material parameters; in particular we compute the specific heat, speed of sound, and compressibility along appropriate lines of constant physics. We show that in the entire range relevant for the beam energy scan at RHIC, the specific heat, speed of sound, and compressibility show no indication for an approach to critical behavior that one would expect close to a possibly existing critical endpoint.",

Numerical results obtained using the Grassmann TRG algorithm are shown for the case of $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory and compared to Monte Carlo results.",

Using numerical analysis within the lattice formalism with exactly massless overlap fermions, we show the emergence of such behavior in the infrared limit. Both the continuum extrapolated low-lying eigenvalues of the massless Dirac operator and the propagator of scalar mesons exhibit a flow from the ultraviolet to the infrared. We find that the amplitude of the conserved current correlator remains invariant under the flow, while the amplitude of the scalar correlator approaches $N_f$-independent values in the infrared.",

While respondents reported generally high levels of feeling welcome at the lattice conference, women and people with diverse gender identities, sexual orientations, ethnic backgrounds and religious affiliations feel less included and have more negative experiences at the lattice conference than their peers. Respondents report that they are actively informing themselves about inequities in the community, however a large fraction of survey participants underestimate the severity of the problem, as was found in previous surveys. The survey data indicate that this situation can be most effectively improved by organizing talks and events about issues of diversity and inclusion within the lattice community. Respondents also reported that individual readings of scientific papers on equity and inclusion are effective in giving people agency in making a change and hence it may be helpful to collate a collection of important articles on these topics.",

We show that below the chiral crossover temperature thermodynamics of charm can be very well understood in terms of charmed hadrons. Above the chiral transition charm quarks show up as new degrees of freedom contributing to the partial charm pressure. However, up to temperatures as high as 175 MeV charmed hadron-like excitations provide a significant contribution to the partial charm pressure.",

      "title": "Toward coherent quantum computation of scattering amplitudes with a measurement-based photonic quantum processor",
      "summary": "In recent years, applications of quantum simulation have been developed to study properties of strongly interacting theories. This has been driven by two factors: on the one hand, needs from theorists to have access to physical observables that are prohibitively difficult to study using classical computing; on the other hand, quantum hardware becoming increasingly reliable and scalable to larger systems. In this work, we discuss the feasibility of using quantum optical simulation for studying scattering observables that are presently inaccessible via lattice QCD and are at the core of the experimental program at Jefferson Lab, the future Electron-Ion Collider, and other accelerator facilities. We show that recent progress in measurement-based photonic quantum computing can be leveraged to provide deterministic generation of required exotic gates and implementation in a single photonic quantum processor.",

In particular, we implement, for the first time, the Hamiltonian with the next-nearest neighbor exchange interaction in conjunction with the nearest neighbor interaction on IBM's superconducting quantum computer and carry out the time evolution of the spin chain by employing first-order Trotterization. Furthermore, our novel implementation of second-order Trotterization for the isotropic Heisenberg spin chain, involving only nearest-neighbor exchange interaction, enables precise measurement of the expectation values of staggered magnetization observable across a range of up to 100 qubits. Notably, in both cases, our approach results in a constant circuit depth in each Trotter step, independent of the initial number of qubits. Our demonstration of the accurate measurement of expectation values for the large-scale quantum system using superconducting quantum computers designates the quantum utility of these devices for investigating various properties of many-body quantum systems. This will be a stepping stone to achieving the quantum advantage over classical ones in simulating quantum systems before the fault tolerance quantum era.",

Though the process is not reversible, the physical volume preserving aspect minimises the time spent rethermalisating the lattice after coarsening periods, which we then treat as a new ensemble disjoint from previous runs. We have tested this technique on the pure gauge 2D Schwinger model and find that topological sampling rates are improved. We also demonstrate that autocorrelation times for extensive observables are restored to their pre-coarsening values after coarsening periods over a acceptably short simulation time.",

This work is done using lattice gauge ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration, consisting of 2+1+1 flavors of highly improved staggered quarks with a physical pion mass at lattice spacing $a\\approx 0.09$ fm and a box width $L\\approx 5.76$ fm. We present results for the nucleon $H$ and $E$ GPDs with average boost momentum $P_z\\approx 2$ GeV at momentum transfers $Q^2=[0, 0.97]$ GeV$^2$ at skewness $ξ=0$ as well as $Q^2\\in 0.23$ GeV$^2$ at $ξ=0.1$, renormalized in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme at scale $μ=2.0$ GeV, with two- and one-loop matching, respectively. We demonstrate that the simultaneous application of RGR and LRR significantly reduces the systematic errors in renormalized matrix elements and distributions for both the zero and nonzero skewness GPDs, and that it is necessary to include both RGR and LRR at higher orders in the matching and renormalization processes.",

These recursive methods are derived by looking at the commutation relations of the observables with the Hamiltonian. We discuss how this self-consistent (bootstrap) approach can be applied to the study of digitized scalar field theory in the harmonic basis. Using known results, we develop the method by testing on quantum systems, including the harmonic and anharmonic oscillators. We report recent numerical results for up to four coupled anharmonic oscillators.

Combined with step scaling, it has been successfully used to calculate the $\\mathrm{SU}(3)$ $Λ$ parameter. As with all gradient flow-based schemes, the coupling constant is highly correlated with the topological charge and affected by topology freezing, an issue addressed by projecting the determination of the coupling onto the zero topological sector. As an alternative to the zero-charge projection, we combine TGF with PTBC, by replicating multiple copies of the same lattice, interpolating between periodic and open boundary conditions in a parallel-tempered manner. We present a first exploration of these ideas by analyzing specific ensembles of $\\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattices with and without PTBC.",

      "summary": "Results obtained with stochastic methods have an inherent uncertainty due to the finite number of samples that can be achieved in practice. In lattice QCD this problem is particularly salient in some observables like, for instance, observables involving one or more baryons and it is the main problem preventing the calculation of nuclear forces from first principles. The method of control variables has been used extensively in statistics and it amounts to computing the expectation value of the difference between the observable of interest and another observable whose average is known to be zero but is correlated with the observable of interest. Recently, control variates methods emerged as a promising solution in the context of lattice field theories. In our current study, instead of relying on an educated guess to determine the control variate, we utilize a neural network to parametrize this function. Using 1+1 dimensional scalar field theory as a testbed, we demonstrate that this neural network approach yields substantial improvements. Notably, our findings indicate that the neural network ansatz is particularly effective in the strong coupling regime.",

This theory is one instance of stealth dark matter, a class of strongly coupled theories, where the lowest mass stable baryon is the dark matter candidate. This work constitutes the first milestone in the program to study stealth dark matter self-interactions. Here, we focus on reducing excited state contamination in the single baryon channel by applying the Laplacian Heaviside method, as well as projecting our baryon operators onto the irreducible representations of the octahedral group. We compare our resulting spectrum to previous work involving Gaussian smeared non-projected operators and find good agreement with reduced statistical uncertainties. We also present the spectrum of the low-lying odd-parity baryons for the first time.",

Two lattice QCD ensembles at the physical pion mass are used: these were generated using a tree-level Symanzik-improved gauge action and 2+1 flavour tree-level improved Wilson Clover fermions coupling via 2-level HEX-smearing. The moments are extracted from forward matrix elements of local leading twist operators. We determine renomalization factors in RI-(S)MOM and match to $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ at scale $2\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$. Our findings show that operators that exhibit vanishing kinematics at zero momentum can have significantly reduced excited-state contamination. The resulting polarized moment is used to quantify the longitudinal contribution to the quark spin-orbit correlation. All our results agree within two sigma with previous lattice results.",

      "summary": "Quantum computers offer the potential to simulate nuclear processes that are classically intractable. With the goal of understanding the necessary quantum resources to realize this potential, we employ state-of-the-art Hamiltonian-simulation methods, and conduct a thorough algorithmic analysis, to estimate the qubit and gate costs to simulate low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) of nuclear physics. Within the framework of nuclear lattice EFT, we obtain simulation costs for the leading-order pionless and pionful EFTs. For the latter, we consider both static pions represented by a one-pion-exchange potential between the nucleons, and dynamical pions represented by relativistic bosonic fields coupled to non-relativistic nucleons. Within these models, we examine the resource costs for the tasks of time evolution and energy estimation for physically relevant scales. We account for model errors associated with truncating either long-range interactions in the one-pion-exchange EFT or the pionic Hilbert space in the dynamical-pion EFT, and for algorithmic errors associated with product-formula approximations and quantum phase estimation. We find that the pionless EFT is the least costly to simulate, followed by the one-pion-exchange theory, then the dynamical-pion theory. We demonstrate how symmetries of the low-energy nuclear Hamiltonians can be utilized to obtain tighter error bounds. By retaining the locality of nucleonic interactions when mapped to qubits, we achieve reduced circuit depth and substantial parallelization. In the process, we develop new methods to bound the algorithmic error for classes of fermionic number-preserving Hamiltonians, and obtain tighter Trotter error bounds by explicitly computing nested commutators of Hamiltonian terms. Compared to previous estimates for the pionless EFT, our results represent an improvement by several orders of magnitude.",

Results of the methods used are presented and the final finite-volume spectra are shown. The analysis of the scattering amplitude based on these results, exhibits a two-pole structure for the $Λ(1405)$, a virtual bound state below the $πΣ$ threshold and a resonance pole right below the $\\bar{K}N$ threshold.",

Using the 2D $U(1)$ pure gauge model, combined with the guided Monte Carlo algorithm, we show that the integrated autocorrelation time of the topological charge can be exponentially improved in the wall clock time. Our study indicates that incorporating renormalization group picture is a powerful and essential ingredient to accelerate the HMC at large $β$.",

      "summary": "We consider multileg ladders of Rydberg atoms which have been proposed as quantum simulators for the compact Abelian Higgs model (CAHM) in 1+1 dimensions [Y. Meurice, Phys. Rev. D 104, 094513 (2021)] and modified versions of theses simulators such as triangular prisms. Starting with the physical Hamiltonian for the analog simulator, we construct translation-invariant effective Hamiltonians by integrating over the simulator high-energy states produced by the blockade mechanism when some of the atoms are sufficiently close to each others. Remarkably, for all the simulators considered, the effective Hamiltonians have the three types of terms present for the CAHM (Electric field, matter charge and currents energies) but, in addition, terms quartic in the electric field. For the two leg ladder, these additional terms cannot be removed by fine-tuning the adjustable parameters of currently available devices. For positive detuning, the new terms create highly-degenerate vacua resulting in a very interesting phase diagram. Using numerical methods, we demonstrate the close correspondence between the physical simulator and the effective description for the ground state energy and real-time evolution. We discuss the phase diagram at fixed geometry with variable Rabi frequency and detuning and show that a rich variety of phases can be reached with potential interest in the context of QCD at finite density. We illustrate how the effective description can be used to design simulators with desirable properties from the point of view of constructing hybrid event generators.",

In this formulation, the directional vector of the auxiliary field in Euclidean space has the form $\\tilde n = (in^0, \\vec 0_\\perp, n^3)$, where the time component is purely imaginary. The components of these complex directional vectors in the Euclidean space can be mapped directly to the rapidities of the Minkowski space soft function. We present the results of the one-loop calculation of the Euclidean space analog to the soft function using these complex directional vectors. As a result, we show that the calculation is valid only when the directional vectors obey the relation: $|r| = |n^3/n^0| > 1$, and that this result corresponds to a computation in Minkowski space with space-like directed Wilson lines. Finally, we show that a lattice calculable object can be constructed that has the desired properties of the soft function.",

The scattering phase shifts are obtained using Lüscher's method from the energy spectra in two different volumes. To ensure that no relevant energy level is missed, we use large, symmetric $7 \\times 7$ and $8 \\times 8$ correlation matrices that include, at both source and sink, $B^{(*)}$-$\\bar{D}$ scattering operators with the lowest three or four possible back-to-back momenta in addition to local $\\bar{b}\\bar{c}ud$ operators. We fit the energy dependence of the extracted scattering phase shifts using effective-range expansions. We observe sharp peaks in the $B^{(*)}$-$\\bar{D}$ scattering rates close to the thresholds, which are associated with shallow bound states, either genuine or virtual, a few MeV or less below the $B^{(*)}$-$\\bar{D}$ thresholds. In addition, we find hints for resonances with masses of order $100$ MeV above the thresholds and decay widths of order $200$ MeV.",

      "summary": "As the study of three-hadron physics from lattice QCD matures, it is necessary to develop proper analysis tools in order to reliably study a variety of phenomena, including resonance spectroscopy and nuclear structure. Reconstructing the three-particle scattering amplitude requires solving integral equations, which can be written in terms of data-constrained dynamical functions and physical on-shell quantities. The driving term in these equations is the so-called one-particle exchange, which leads to a kinematic divergence for particles on-mass-shell. A vital component in defining three-particle amplitudes with definite parity and total angular momentum, which are used in spectroscopic studies, is to project the one-particle exchange into definite partial waves. We present a general procedure to construct exact analytic partial wave projections of the one-particle exchange contribution for any system composed of three spinless hadrons. Our result allows one full control over the analytic structure of the projection, which we explore for some low-lying partial waves with applications to three pions.",

The procedure is based on the gradient flow for fermion and gauge fields. The flowed matrix elements of twist-2 operators renormalize multiplicatively, and the matching with the physical matrix elements can be obtained using continuum symmetries and the irreducible representations of Euclidean 4-dimensional rotations. We calculate the matching coefficients at one-loop in perturbation theory for moments of any order in the flavor nonsinglet case. We also give specific examples of operators that could be used in lattice QCD computations. It turns out that it is possible to choose operators with identical Lorentz indices and still have a multiplicative matching. One can thus use twist-2 operators exclusively with temporal indices, thus substantially improving the signal-to-noise ratio in the computation of the hadronic matrix elements.",

We employ a number of different versions of regularization-independent (RI$'$) renormalization prescriptions which address the power and logarithmic divergences of such nonlocal operators, the pinch-pole singularities at infinite Wilson-line lengths, as well as the mixing among operators of different Dirac structures, as dictated by discrete symmetries. All cancelations of divergences and admixtures are confirmed by our results at one-loop level. We compare all the different prescriptions and we provide the conversion matrices at one-loop order which relate the matrix elements of the staple operators in RI$'$ to the reference scheme $\\overline{\\rm MS}$.",

      "summary": "We present results for the axial-vector coupling and root-mean-square (RMS) radii of the nucleon obtained from 2+1 flavor lattice QCD at the physical point with a large spatial extent of about 10 fm. Our calculations are performed with the PACS10 gauge configurations generated by the PACS Collaboration with the six stout-smeared $O(a)$ improved Wilson-clover quark action and Iwasaki gauge action at $β$ = 1.82 and 2.00 corresponding to lattice spacings of 0.085 fm and 0.063 fm, respectively. We first evaluate the value of the axial-vector coupling of the nucleon ($g_A$). In addition, the isovector electric, magnetic and axial radii and magnetic moment from the corresponding form factors are also determined. Combining the results at $β=1.82$ and $2.00$, we finally discuss the finite lattice spacing effect. It was found that the effect on $g_A$ is kept smaller than the statistical error of 2% while the effect on the isovector radii was observed as a possible discretization error of about 10%, regardless of the channel.",

      "summary": "This paper introduces a transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) factorization scheme designed to unify both large and small Bjorken-x regimes. We compute the next-to-leading order (NLO) quantum chromodynamics (QCD) corrections to the gluon TMD operator for an unpolarized hadron within this proposed scheme. This leads to the emergence of a new TMD evolution, incorporating those in transverse momentum, rapidity, and Bjorken-x. When matched to the collinear factorization scheme, our factorization scheme faithfully reproduces the well-established Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) and Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) evolutions. Conversely, matching with high-energy factorization not only yields the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) evolution but also reveals distinctive signatures of CSS logarithms. The development of this novel TMD factorization scheme, capable of seamlessly reconciling disparate Bjorken-x regimes and faithfully reproducing established QCD evolution equations, has the potential to significantly advance our comprehension of high-energy processes and three-dimensional parton structures of hadrons.",

      "summary": "Fermionic Monte Carlo calculations with continuous auxiliary fields often encounter infinite variance problem from fermionic observables. This issue renders the estimation of observables unreliable, even with an infinite number of samples. In this work, we show that the infinite variance problem stems from the fermionic determinant. Also, we propose an approach to address this problem by employing a reweighting method that utilizes the distribution from an extra time-slice. Two strategies to compute the reweighting factor are explored: one involves truncating and analytically calculating the reweighting factor, while the other employs a secondary Monte Carlo estimation. With Hubbard model as a testbed, we demonstrate that utilizing the sub-Monte Carlo estimation, coupled with an unbiased estimator, offers a solution that effectively mitigates the infinite variance problem at a minimal additional cost.",

      "summary": "We study the Renormalisation Group (RG) running of the non-singlet tensor operator, for $N_\\mathrm{\\scriptstyle f}=3$ QCD with Wilson fermions in a mixed action setup, with standard Schrödinger Functional (SF) boundary conditions for sea quarks and chirally rotated Schrödinger Functional ($χ$SF) boundary conditions for valence quarks. Based on a recursive finite-size scaling technique we compute non-perturbatively the tensor step-scaling function for an energy range between a hadronic scale and an electroweak scale, above which perturbation theory may be safely applied. Our result is expressed as the RG-running factor $T^{\\mathrm{RGI}}/[ T(μ_{\\mathrm{had}})]_{\\scriptstyle \\rm R}$, where the numerator is the scale independent (Renormalisation Group Invariant - RGI) tensor operator and the denominator is its renormalised counterpart at a hadronic scale $μ_{\\mathrm{had}} = 233(8)$~MeV in a given scheme. We determine the step-scaling function in four distinct renormalisation schemes. We also compute the renormalisation parameters of these schemes at $μ_{\\mathrm{had}}$ which, combined with the RG-running factor, gives the scheme-independent quantity $Z^{\\mathrm{RGI}}_{\\mathrm T}(g_0^2)$ in four schemes and for a range of bare gauge couplings in which large volume hadronic matrix element simulations are performed by the CLS consortium in $N_\\mathrm{\\scriptstyle f}=2+1$ QCD. All four results are compatible and also agree with a recent determination based on a unitary setup for Wilson quarks with Schrödinger Functional boundary conditions~arXiv:2309.04314 . This provides a strong universality test.",

Results for the former are in good agreement with Functional Renormalization Group calculations. We also present results for the location of the Langer edge singularity in the 3-d,Z(2) universality class. We find that in terms of the complex scaling variable z the distance of the Langer edge singularity to the critical point agrees within errors with that of the Lee-Yang edge singularity.

      "summary": "A number of discrepancies have emerged between lattice computations and data-driven dispersive evaluations of the RBC/UKQCD Intermediate-window-hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. It is therefore interesting to obtain data-driven estimates for the light-quark-connected and strange-plus-disconnected components of this window quantity, allowing for a more detailed comparison between the lattice and data-driven approaches. The aim of this paper is to provide these estimates, extending the analysis to several other window quantities, including two windows designed to focus on the region in which the two-pion contribution is dominant. Clear discrepancies are observed for all light-quark-connected contributions considered, while good agreement with lattice results is found for strange-plus disconnected contributions to the quantities for which corresponding lattice results exist. The largest of these discrepancies is that for the RBC/UKQCD intermediate window, where, as previously reported, our data-driven result, $a_μ^{W1,{\\rm lqc}}=198.9(1.1)\\times 10^{-10}$, is in significant tension with the results of 8 different recent lattice determinations. Our strategy is the same as recently employed in obtaining data-driven estimates for the light-quark-connected and strange-plus-disconnected components of the full leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. Updated versions of those earlier results are also presented, for completeness.",

      "summary": "The electromagnetic trapping of ion chains can be regarded as a process of non-trivial entangled quantum state preparation within Hilbert spaces of the local axial motional modes. To begin uncovering properties of this entanglement resource produced as a byproduct of conventional ion-trap quantum information processing, the quantum continuous-variable formalism is herein utilized to focus on the leading-order entangled ground state of local motional modes in the presence of a quadratic trapping potential. The decay of entanglement between disjoint subsets of local modes is found to exhibit features of entanglement structure and responses to partial measurement reminiscent of the free massless scalar field vacuum. With significant fidelities between the two, even for large system sizes, a framework is established for initializing quantum field simulations via \"imaging\" extended entangled states from natural sources, rather than building correlations through deep circuits of few-body entangling operators. By calculating probabilities in discrete Fock subspaces of the local motional modes, considerations are presented for locally transferring these pre-distributed entanglement resources to the qudits of ion internal energy levels, improving this procedure's anticipated experimental viability.",

Using the replica method, we investigate the $q=2$ Renyi entropy of the entanglement of gluon fields inside and in the vicinity of the confining QCD string between the quark and the antiquark. We find that there is excess entropy of gluon entanglement compared to vacuum fluctuations. This excess of entanglement entropy is associated with the gluon flux tube, and we find that it has a finite non-zero value in the continuum. We investigate the dependence of gluon entanglement on the geometry of longitudinal and transverse partitioning of the flux tube. Our preliminary results suggest scaling of the entanglement entropy with the area of the boundary overlapping with the flux tube.",

      "summary": "Understanding the transitions of nucleons into various resonance structures through electromagnetic interactions plays a pivotal role in advancing our comprehension of the strong interactions within the domain of quark confinement. Furthermore, gaining precise insights into the elastic and resonance structures of nucleons is indispensable for deciphering the physics from neutrino-nucleus scattering cross sections experimental data, which remain theoretically challenging, even in the context of neutrino-nucleon interactions whose profound understanding is imperative for the neutrino oscillation experiments. One promising avenue involves the direct evaluation of the lepton-nucleon scattering cross sections across quasi-elastic, resonance, shallow-inelastic, and deep inelastic regions, which can be achieved through the hadronic tensor formalism in lattice QCD. In this work, we present the determination of the nucleon's Sachs electric form factor using the hadronic tensor formalism and verify that it is consistent with that from the conventional three-point function calculation. We additionally obtain the transition form factor from the nucleon to its first radial excited state within a finite volume. Consequently, we identify the latter with the nucleon-to-Roper transition form factor $G_E^*(Q^2)$, determine the corresponding longitudinal helicity amplitude $S_{1/2}(Q^2)$ and compare our findings with experimental measurements, for the first time using the hadronic tensor formalism. The limitations and systematic improvements of the approach are also discussed.",

Our primary goal is to measure the chiral condensate in the limit when the input electron mass $m$ is zero. We observe a non-zero value, indicating that the external magnetic field catalyzes chiral symmetry breaking as predicted by approximate truncated Schwinger-Dyson methods. Such behaviour is associated with dominance by the lowest Landau level which causes the effective dimensional reduction from $3+1$~dimensions to $1+1$ dimensions for charged particles (electrons and positrons) where the attractive forces of QED can produce chiral symmetry breaking with a dynamical electron mass and associated chiral condensate. Since our lattice simulations use bare (lattice) parameters, while the Schwinger-Dyson analyses work with renormalized quantities, direct numerical comparison will require renormalization of our lattice results.",

However, unlike the case of chiral symmetry, a doubler free lattice action exists which is invariant under the corresponding onsite symmetry. This allows for a clear diagnosis and solution to the problem using mirror fermions resulting in a unique gauge invariant measure. By introducing an appropriate set of Yukawa interactions which are consistent with 't Hooft anomaly cancellation we conjecture the mirrors can be decoupled from low energy physics. Moreover, the minimal such Kähler-Dirac mirror model yields a light sector which corresponds, in the flat space continuum limit, to the Pati-Salam GUT model.",

These quantities can be expressed gauge-invariantly as the correlators of Coulomb-gauge-dressed fields, which reduce to the standard TMD correlators under principal-value prescription in the infinite boost limit. In the framework of Large-Momentum Effective Theory, a quasi-TMD defined from such correlators in a large-momentum hadron state can be matched to the TMD via a factorization formula, whose exact form is derived using Soft Collinear Effective Theory and verified at one-loop order. Compared to the currently used gauge-invariant correlators, this new method can substantially improve statistical precision and simplify renormalization for the time-reversal-even TMDs, which will greatly enhance the predicative power of lattice QCD in the non-perturbative region.",

      "summary": "At its critical point, the three-dimensional lattice Ising model is described by a conformal field theory (CFT), the 3d Ising CFT. Instead of carrying out simulations on Euclidean lattices, we use the Quantum Finite Elements method to implement radially quantized critical $φ^4$ theory on simplicial lattices approaching $\\mathbb{R} \\times S^2$. Computing the four-point function of identical scalars, we demonstrate the power of radial quantization by the accurate determination of the scaling dimensions $Δ_ε$ and $Δ_{T}$ as well as ratios of the operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients $f_{σσε}$ and $f_{σσT}$ of the first spin-0 and spin-2 primary operators $ε$ and $T$ of the 3d Ising CFT.",

Here we want to focus on the isospin breaking corrections to the leading order HVP. In many lattice applications, the photon propagator is treated stochastically; however, by analogy with the hadronic light-by-light contribution (HLbL) to $(g-2)_μ$, we suggest a coordinate-space approach to the HVP at next-to-leading order. We present a calculation of the two diagrams of the (2+2) topology at unphysical pion mass, where we apply a Pauli-Villars regularization for the extra photon propagator in the diagram that is UV-divergent. We compare the UV-finite diagram to the pseudoscalar exchange contributions calculated from a vector-meson dominance model.",

We study in this paper the evolution of non-singlet parton distribution functions (PDFs) in the short-distance factorization scheme which notably arises in lattice calculations in the pseudo-distribution approach. We provide an assessment of non-perturbative evolution of PDFs from already published lattice matrix elements, and show how this evolution can be used to reduce the fluctuation of the lattice data. We compare our result with expectations obtained thanks to a perturbative matching to $\\overline{MS}$. By highlighting the limitations of the current computations, we advocate for a new strategy using lattice calculations in small volume.",

Additionally, we determine the isovector and isoscalar tensor charges for the proton. In both calculations, the disconnected contributions to the isoscalar matrix elements have been ignored. The calculations are performed using a single ensemble of $N_f = 2 +1$ highly-improved staggered quarks simulated with physical-mass quarks and a lattice spacing of $a = 0.076$ fm. The Wilson-clover action, with physical quark masses and smeared gauge links obtained from one iteration of hypercubic smearing, is used in the valence sector. Using the NLO operator product expansion, we extract the lowest four to six Mellin moments and the PDFs via a neural network from the matrix elements in the pseudo-PDF approach. In addition, we calculate the PDFs in the quasi-PDF approach with hybrid-scheme renormalization and the recently developed leading-renormalon resummation technique, at NLO with the resummation of leading small-$x$ logarithms.",

The self-consistent $T$-matrix results, which include constraints from the lQCD equation of state in the light-parton sector, can describe the lQCD data for WLCs fairly well once refinements of the input parameters are implemented. In particular, the input potential requires less screening than used in previous $T$-matrix analyses. Pertinent predictions for the spectral and transport properties of the QGP are discussed, including the spatial diffusion coefficient for heavy quarks which turns out to have a rather weak temperature dependence, in approximate agreement with recent lQCD results.",

We focus in particular on the constraining capability of current LQCD data on the sign of $Δg$ at intermediate parton momentum fractions $x$, which was recently brought into question by analysis of data in the absence of parton positivity constraints. We find that present LQCD data cannot discriminate between positive and negative $Δg$ solutions, although significant changes in the solutions for both the gluon and quark sectors are observed.",

      "title": "Generalized Parton Distributions from Lattice QCD with Asymmetric Momentum Transfer: Axial-vector case",
      "summary": "Recently, we made significant advancements in improving the computational efficiency of lattice QCD calculations for Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs). This progress was achieved by adopting calculations of matrix elements in asymmetric frames, deviating from the computationally-expensive symmetric frame typically used, and allowing freedom in the choice for the distribution of the momentum transfer between the initial and final states. A crucial aspect of this approach involves the adoption of a Lorentz covariant parameterization for the matrix elements, introducing Lorentz-invariant amplitudes. This approach also allows us to propose an alternative definition of quasi-GPDs, ensuring frame independence and potentially reduce power corrections in matching to light-cone GPDs. In our previous work, we presented lattice QCD results for twist-2 unpolarized GPDs ($H$ and $E$) of quarks obtained from calculations performed in asymmetric frames at zero skewness. Building upon this work, we now introduce a novel Lorentz covariant parameterization for the axial-vector matrix elements. We employ this parameterization to compute the axial-vector GPD $\\widetilde{H}$ at zero skewness, using an $N_f=2+1+1$ ensemble of twisted mass fermions with clover improvement. The light-quark masses employed in our calculations correspond to a pion mass of approximately 260 MeV.",

      "summary": "We present the first calculation of the pion gluon moment from lattice QCD in the continuum-physical limit. The calculation is done using clover fermions for the valence action with three pion masses, 220, 310 and 690 MeV, and three lattice spacings, 0.09, 0.12, and 0.15 fm, using ensembles generated by MILC Collaboration with 2+1+1 flavors of highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ). On the lattice, we nonperturbatively renormalize the gluon operator in RI/MOM scheme using the cluster-decomposition error reduction (CDER) technique to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the renormalization constant. We extrapolate the pion gluon moment to the continuum-physical limit and obtain $0.364(38)_{\\text{stat}+\\text{NPR}}(36)_\\text{mixing}$ in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme at 2 GeV, with first error being the statistical error and uncertainties in nonperturbative renormalization, and the second being a systematic uncertainty estimating the effect of ignoring quark mixing. Our pion gluon momentum fraction has a central value lower than two recent single-ensemble lattice-QCD results near physical pion mass but is consistent with the recent global fits by JAM and xFitter and with most QCD-model estimates.",

The pion valence distribution is renormalized in hybrid scheme with Wilson-line mass subtraction at large distances in coordinate space, followed by a procedure to match it to the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme. We focus on the zero-skewness limit, where the GPD has a probability-density interpretation in the longitudinal Bjorken $x$ and the transverse impact-parameter distributions. We take the integral of our GPD functions to generate leading moment so that we can make comparisons with past lattice-QCD and experimental determinations of the pion form factors and found consistent agreement among them.

      "summary": "Qubit regularization provides a rich framework to explore quantum field theories. The freedom to choose how the important symmetries of the theory are embedded in the qubit regularization scheme allows us to construct new lattice models with rich phase diagrams. Some of the phases can contain topological terms which lead to critical phases. In this work we introduce and study the SU(3)-F qubit regularization scheme to embed the SO(3) spin-symmetry. We argue that qubit models in this regularization scheme contain several phases including a critical phase which describes the k = 1 Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) at long distances, and two massive phases one of which is trvially gapped and the other which breaks the lattice translation symmetry. We construct a simple space-time Euclidean lattice model with a single coupling U and study it using the Monte Carlo method. We show the model has a critical phase at small U and a trivially massive phase at large U with a first order transition separating the two. Another feature of our model is that it is symmetric under space-time rotations, which means the temporal and spatial lattice spacing are connected to each other. The unitary time evolution operator obtained by a Wick rotation of the transfer matrix of our model can help us compute the physics of the k = 1 WZW CFT in real time without the need for tuning the temporal lattice spacing to zero. We use this idea to introduce the concept of a relativistic quantum circuit on a discrete space-time lattice.",

It was proposed that its non-analytic behavior in thermal infrared phase reflects the separation of QCD system into an IR component and an independent bulk. Here we study the ``plateau modes\" in IR component, whose dimensional properties were puzzling. Indeeed, in the recent metal-to-critical scenario of transition to IR phase, this low-dimensional plateau connects the Anderson-like mobility edge $λ_\\text{IR}=0$ in Dirac spectrum with mobility edges $\\pm λ_\\text{A}$. For this structure to be truly Anderson-like, plateau modes have to be exponentially localized, implying that both the effective distances $L_\\text{eff} \\propto L^γ$ and the effective volumes $V_\\text{eff} \\propto L^{d_\\text{IR}}$ in these modes grow slower than any positive power of IR cutoff $L$. Although $γ=0$ was confirmed in the plateau, it was found that $d_\\text{IR}\\approx 1$. Here we apply the recently proposed multidimension technique to the problem. We conclude that a plateau mode of pure-glue QCD at UV cutoff $a \\!=\\! 0.085\\,$fm occupies a subvolume of IR dimension zero with probability at least 0.9999, substantiating this aspect of metal-to-critical scenario to a respective degree.",

We use one ensemble of $N_f=2+1+1$ maximally twisted mass fermions with a clover improvement, and the Iwasaki improved gluon action. The quark masses are tuned to produce a pion with a mass of 260 MeV. The ensemble has a lattice spacing of $a=0.093$ fm and a spatial extent of 3 fm. We employ the pseudo-distribution approach, which relies on matrix elements of non-local operators that couple to momentum-boosted hadrons. In this work, we use five values of the momentum boost between 0 and 1.67 GeV. The gluon field strength tensors of the non-local operator are connected with straight Wilson lines of varying length $z$. The light-cone Ioffe time distribution (ITD) is extracted utilizing data with $z$ up to 0.56 fm and a quadratic parametrization in terms of the Ioffe time at fixed values of $z$. We explore systematic effects, such as the effect of the stout smearing for the gluon operator, excited states effects, and the dependence on the maximum value of $z$ entering the fits to obtain the gluon PDF. Also, for the first time, the mixing with the quark singlet PDFs is eliminated using matrix elements with non-local quark operators that were previously analyzed within the quasi-PDF framework on the same ensemble. Here, we expand the data set for the quark singlet and reanalyze within the pseudo-PDFs method eliminating the corresponding mixing in the gluon PDF.",

      "summary": "In recent years, detailed studies of three-pion systems have become possible in lattice QCD. This has in turn led to interest in 3-to-3 scattering of pions in the chiral perturbation theory framework. In addition to being an interesting study of multi-meson dynamics in its own right, it provides a valuable handle on finite-volume effects and the pion mass dependence, thus complementing the lattice results. I present our derivation of the next-to-leading order amplitude for this process, as well as its conversion into the three-particle K-matrix, which enables direct comparison to the lattice. Our results significantly improve the agreement between theory and lattice, which was poor when only leading-order effects were taken into account.",

Employing a light-quark mass corresponding to $m_π\\approx 391$ MeV, we determine coupled-channel scattering amplitudes up to around 4100 MeV considering all kinematically relevant channels consisting of a pair of open-charm mesons or a charmonium meson with a light meson. A single isolated scalar resonance near 4000 MeV is found with large couplings to $D\\bar{D}$, $D_s \\bar{D}_s$ and the kinematically closed $D^* \\bar{D}^*$ channel. A single tensor resonance at a similar mass couples strongly to $D\\bar{D}$, $D\\bar{D}^*$ and $D^* \\bar{D}^*$. We compare the extracted resonances to contemporary experimental candidate states, previous lattice results and theoretical modeling. In contrast to several other studies, we do not find any significant feature in the scalar amplitudes between the ground state $χ_{c0}(1P)$ and the resonance found around 4000 MeV.",

Working at $m_π\\approx 391$ MeV, more than 200 finite-volume energy levels are computed and these are used in extensions of the Lüscher formalism to determine infinite-volume coupled-channel scattering amplitudes. We find that this energy region contains a single $χ_{c0}$ and a single $χ_{c2}$ resonance. Both are found as pole singularities on the closest unphysical Riemann sheet, just below 4000 MeV with widths around 70 MeV. The largest couplings are to kinematically-closed $D^* \\bar{D}^*$ channels in $S$-wave, and couplings to several decay channels consisting of pairs of open-charm mesons are found to be large and significant in both cases.

This rejection-free algorithm allows for the factorization of local and global terms in the action, a condition needed for efficient simulation of theories with global terms, while still maintaining detailed balance. We test our algorithm on the $2d$ Ising model, and against results for EDT obtained with standard Metropolis. Our new algorithm allows us to simulate EDT at finer lattice spacings than previously possible, and we find geometries that resemble semiclassical Euclidean de Sitter space in agreement with earlier results at coarser lattices. The agreement between lattice data and the classical de Sitter solution continues to get better as the lattice spacing decreases.",

The values of the lattice spacings of these three physical point ensembles are 0.080 fm, 0.068 fm, and 0.057 fm, and spatial sizes 5.1 fm, 5.44 fm, and 5.47 fm, respectively, yielding $m_πL$>3.6. Convergence to the ground state matrix elements is assessed using multi-state fits. We study the momentum dependence of the three form factors and check the partially conserved axial-vector current (PCAC) hypothesis and the pion pole dominance (PPD). We show that in the continuum limit, the PCAC and PPD relations are satisfied. We also show that the Goldberger-Treimann relation is approximately fulfilled and determine the Goldberger-Treiman discrepancy. We find for the nucleon axial charge $g_A$=1.245(28)(14), for the axial radius $\\langle r^2_A \\rangle$=0.339(48)(06) fm$^2$, for the pion-nucleon coupling constant $g_{πNN} \\equiv \\lim_{Q^2 \\rightarrow -m_π^2} G_{πNN}(Q^2)$=13.25(67)(69) and for $G_P(0.88m_μ^2)\\equiv g_P^*$=8.99(39)(49).",

      "summary": "Two analysis techniques, the generalized eigenvalue method (GEM) or Prony's (or related) method (PM), are commonly used to analyze statistical estimates of correlation functions produced in lattice quantum field theory calculations. GEM takes full advantage of the matrix structure of correlation functions but only considers individual pairs of time separations when much more data exists. PM can be applied to many time separations and many individual matrix elements simultaneously but does not fully exploit the matrix structure of the correlation function. We combine both these methods into a single framework based on matrix polynomials. As these algebraic methods are well known for producing extensive spectral information about statistically-noisy data, the method should be paired with some information criteria, like the recently proposed Bayesean model averaging.",

We use classical and quantum algorithms to simulate real-time evolution and measure out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOC). The latter can probe thermalization and scrambling of quantum information under time evolution. We compared tensor network-based methods both with simulation on gated-based superconducting quantum devices and analog quantum simulation using Rydberg arrays. While studying this system's thermalization properties, we observed different regimes depending on the radius of curvature of the space. In particular, we find a region of parameter space where the thermalization time depends only logarithmically on the number of degrees of freedom.",

Surprisingly, the derivation leads to a set of geometric constraints that a lattice must satisfy in order for the model to have a well-defined continuum limit.

I discuss the inherent benefits of using non-uniform simplicial lattices to study quantum field theory and how the methods developed here can potentially be generalized for use with other theories.",

In the unitarity limit, it leads to an infinite tower of three-body bound states with energies forming a geometric sequence. In this work, we study the evolution of these so-called Efimov states using relativistic scattering theory. We identify them as poles of the three-particle $S$ matrix and trace their trajectories in the complex energy plane as they evolve from virtual states through bound states to resonances. We dial the scattering parameters toward the unitarity limit and observe the emergence of the universal scaling of energies and couplings -- a behavior known from the non-relativistic case. Interestingly, we find that Efimov resonances follow unusual, cyclic trajectories accumulating at the three-body threshold and then disappear at some values of the two-body scattering length. We propose a partial resolution to this \"missing states\" problem.",

While the short-distance contribution to $ε_K$ can be accurately calculated in terms of standard model parameters and a single hadronic matrix element, $B_K$, there is a long-distance part which is estimated to be approximately $5\\%$ of the total and is more difficult to determine. A method for determining this small but phenomenologically important contribution to $ε_K$ using lattice QCD is proposed and a complete exploratory calculation of the contribution is presented. This exploratory calculation uses an unphysical light quark mass corresponding to a 339 MeV pion mass and an unphysical charm quark mass of 968 MeV, expressed in the $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme at 2 GeV. This calculation demonstrates that future work should be able to determine this long-distance contribution from first principles with a controlled error of 10\\% or less.",

      "summary": "Sampling from known probability distributions is a ubiquitous task in computational science, underlying calculations in domains from linguistics to biology and physics. Generative machine-learning (ML) models have emerged as a promising tool in this space, building on the success of this approach in applications such as image, text, and audio generation. Often, however, generative tasks in scientific domains have unique structures and features -- such as complex symmetries and the requirement of exactness guarantees -- that present both challenges and opportunities for ML. This Perspective outlines the advances in ML-based sampling motivated by lattice quantum field theory, in particular for the theory of quantum chromodynamics. Enabling calculations of the structure and interactions of matter from our most fundamental understanding of particle physics, lattice quantum chromodynamics is one of the main consumers of open-science supercomputing worldwide. The design of ML algorithms for this application faces profound challenges, including the necessity of scaling custom ML architectures to the largest supercomputers, but also promises immense benefits, and is spurring a wave of development in ML-based sampling more broadly. In lattice field theory, if this approach can realize its early promise it will be a transformative step towards first-principles physics calculations in particle, nuclear and condensed matter physics that are intractable with traditional approaches.",

This contribution emerges as a significant component within the theoretical uncertainties surrounding the extraction of $|V_{ud}|$ from superallowed decays. Our calculation is conducted using two domain wall fermion ensembles at the physical pion mass. To construct the nucleon 4-point correlation functions, we employ the random sparsening field technique. Furthermore, we incorporate long-distance contributions to the hadronic function using the infinite-volume reconstruction method. Upon performing the continuum extrapolation, we arrive at $\\square_{γW}^{VA}=3.65(8)_{\\mathrm{lat}}(1)_{\\mathrm{PT}}\\times10^{-3}$. Consequently, this yields a slightly higher value of $|V_{ud}|=0.97386(11)_{\\mathrm{exp.}}(9)_{\\mathrm{RC}}(27)_{\\mathrm{NS}}$, reducing the previous $2.1σ$ tension with the CKM unitarity to $1.8σ$.

Here, we provide the one-loop matching coefficients for the $CP$-odd three-gluon operator between two different minimally subtracted 't Hooft-Veltman schemes and the gradient flow. This completes our program to obtain the one-loop gradient-flow matching coefficients for all $CP$-violating and flavor-conserving operators in the low-energy effective field theory up to dimension six.",

      "summary": "Python is a particularly appealing language to carry out data analysis, owing in part to its user-friendly character as well as its access to well maintained and powerful libraries like NumPy and SciPy. Still, for the purpose of analyzing data in a lattice QCD context, some desirable functionality is missing from these libraries. Moreover, scripting languages tend to be slower than compiled ones. To help address these points we present the AnalysisToolbox, a collection of Python modules to facilitate lattice QCD data analysis. Some highlighted features include general-purpose jackknife and bootstrap routines; modules for reading in and storing gauge configurations; a module to carry out hadron resonance gas model calculations; and convenience wrappers for SciPy integration, curve fitting, and splines. These features are sped up behind the scenes using parallelization and just-in-time compilation.",

      "summary": "Research on the QCD phase diagram with lattice field theory methods is dominated by the use of rooted staggered fermions, as they are the computationally cheapest discretization available. We show that rooted staggered fermions at a nonzero baryochemical potential $μ_B$ predict a sharp rise in the baryon density at low temperatures and $μ_B \\gtrsim 3 m_π/2$, where $m_π$ is the Goldstone pion mass. We elucidate the nature of the non-analyticity behind this sharp rise in the density by a comparison of reweighting results with a Taylor expansion of high order. While at first sight this non-analytic behavior becomes apparent at the same position where the pion condensation transition takes place in the phase-quenched theory, the nature of the non-analyticity in the two theories appears to be quite different: While at nonzero isospin density the data are consistent with a genuine thermodynamic (branch-point) singularity, the results at nonzero baryon density point to an essential singularity at $μ_B=0$. The effect is absent for four flavors of degenerate quarks, where rooting is not used. For the two-flavor case, we show numerical evidence that the magnitude of the effect diminishes on finer lattices. We discuss the implications of this technical complication on future studies of the QCD phase diagram.",

Encoding these degrees of freedom on qubit-based hardware demands some sort of ``qubitization'' scheme, where one approximates the behavior of a theory while using only finitely many degrees of freedom. We propose a novel qubitization strategy for gauge theories, called ``fuzzy gauge theory,'' building on the success of the fuzzy $σ$-model in earlier work. We provide arguments that the fuzzy gauge theory lies in the same universality class as regular gauge theory, in which case its use would obviate the need of any further limit besides the usual spatial continuum limit. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these models are relatively resource-efficient for quantum simulations.",

      "summary": "The vacuum of the lattice Schwinger model is prepared on up to 100 qubits of IBM's Eagle-processor quantum computers. A new algorithm to prepare the ground state of a gapped translationally-invariant system on a quantum computer is presented, which we call Scalable Circuits ADAPT-VQE (SC-ADAPT-VQE). This algorithm uses the exponential decay of correlations between distant regions of the ground state, together with ADAPT-VQE, to construct quantum circuits for state preparation that can be scaled to arbitrarily large systems. These scalable circuits can be determined using classical computers, avoiding the challenging task of optimizing parameterized circuits on a quantum computer. SC-ADAPT-VQE is applied to the Schwinger model, and shown to be systematically improvable, with an accuracy that converges exponentially with circuit depth. Both the structure of the circuits and the deviations of prepared wavefunctions are found to become independent of the number of spatial sites, $L$. This allows for a controlled extrapolation of the circuits, determined using small or modest-sized systems, to arbitrarily large $L$. The circuits for the Schwinger model are determined on lattices up to $L=14$ (28 qubits) with the qiskit classical simulator, and subsequently scaled up to prepare the $L=50$ (100 qubits) vacuum on IBM's 127 superconducting-qubit quantum computers ibm_brisbane and ibm_cusco. After introducing an improved error-mitigation technique, which we call Operator Decoherence Renormalization, the chiral condensate and charge-charge correlators obtained from the quantum computers are found to be in good agreement with classical Matrix Product State simulations.",

      "summary": "The precision with which hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) is obtained determines how accurately important observables, such as the muon anomalous magnetic moment, a_μ, or the low-energy running of the electromagnetic coupling, α, are predicted. The two most precise approaches for determining HVP are: dispersive relations combined with e+e- to hadrons cross-section data, and lattice QCD. However, the results obtained in these two approaches display significant tensions, whose origins are not understood. Here we present a framework that sheds light on this issue and, if the two approaches can be reconciled, allows them to be combined. Via this framework, we test the hypothesis that the tensions can be explained by modifying the R-ratio in different intervals of center-of-mass energy sqrt(s). As ingredients, we consider observables that have been precisely determined in both approaches. These are the leading hadronic contributions to a_μ, to the so-called intermediate window observable and to the running of αbetween spacelike virtualities 1GeV^2 and 10GeV^2 (for which only a preliminary lattice result exists). Our tests take into account all uncertainties and correlations, as well as uncertainties on uncertainties in the lattice results. Among our findings, the most striking is that results obtained in the two approaches can be made to agree for all three observables by modifying the ρpeak in the experimental spectrum. In particular, we find that this requires a common ~5\\% increase in the contributions of the peak to each of the three observables. This finding is robust against the presence or absence of one of the constraining observables. However, such an increase is much larger than the uncertainties on the measured R-ratio. We also discuss a variety of generalizations of the methods used here, as well as the limits in the information that can be extracted...",

      "title": "Lattice quantum chromodynamics at large isospin density: 6144 pions in a box",
      "summary": "We present an algorithm to compute correlation functions for systems with the quantum numbers of many identical mesons from lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The algorithm is numerically stable and allows for the computation of $n$-pion correlation functions for $n \\in \\{ 1, \\dots, N\\}$ using a single $N \\times N$ matrix decomposition, improving on previous algorithms. We apply the algorithm to calculations of correlation functions with up to 6144 $π^+$s using two ensembles of gauge field configurations generated with quark masses corresponding to a pion mass $m_π= 170$ MeV and spacetime volumes of $(4.4^3\\times 8.8)\\ {\\rm fm}^4$ and $(5.8^3\\times 11.6)\\ {\\rm fm}^4$. We also discuss statistical techniques for the analysis of such systems, in which the correlation functions vary over many orders of magnitude. In particular, we observe that the many-pion correlation functions are well approximated by log-normal distributions, allowing the extraction of the energies of these systems. Using these energies, the large-isospin-density, zero-baryon-density region of the QCD phase diagram is explored. A peak is observed in the energy density at an isospin chemical potential $μ_I\\sim 1.5 m_π$, signalling the transition into a Bose-Einstein condensed phase. The isentropic speed of sound in the medium is seen to exceed the ideal-gas (conformal) limit ($c_s^2\\leq 1/3$) over a wide range of chemical potential before falling towards the asymptotic expectation at $μ_I\\sim 15 m_π$. These, and other thermodynamic observables, indicate that the isospin chemical potential must be large for the system to be well described by an ideal gas or perturbative QCD.",

While there is $1$--$2σ$ agreement in the cross section with MINERvA data for each bin in $Q^2$, we identify three regions with different relevance and opportunity for LQCD predictions. For $Q^2 \\lesssim 0.2~\\mathrm{GeV}^2$, the phenomenological extractions have large number of data points and LQCD is competitive, while MINERvA data have large errors. For $0.2~\\mathrm{GeV}^2 \\lesssim Q^2 \\lesssim 1~\\mathrm{GeV}^2$, LQCD is competitive with the MINERvA determination, and both give values larger than from phenomenological extraction. For $Q^2 > 1~\\mathrm{GeV}^2$, the MINERvA data are the most precise.

      "summary": "Simulating the nonequilibrium dynamics of thermal states is a fundamental problem across scales from high energy to condensed matter physics. Quantum computers may provide a way to solve this problem efficiently. Preparing a thermal state on a quantum computer is challenging, but there exist methods to circumvent this by computing a weighted sum of time-dependent matrix elements in a convenient basis. While the number of basis states can be large, in this work we show that it can be reduced by simulating only the largest density matrix elements by weight, capturing the density matrix to a specified precision. Leveraging Hamiltonian symmetries enables further reductions. This approach paves the way to more accurate thermal-state dynamics simulations on near-term quantum hardware.",

These amplitudes contain the resonance $Λ(1405)$ with strangeness $S=-1$ and isospin, spin, and parity quantum numbers $I(J^P)=0(1/2^-)$. However, whether there is a single resonance or two nearby resonance poles in this region is controversial theoretically and experimentally. Using single-baryon and meson-baryon operators to extract the finite-volume stationary-state energies to obtain the scattering amplitudes at slightly unphysical quark masses corresponding to $m_π\\approx200$ MeV and $m_K\\approx487$ MeV, this study finds the amplitudes exhibit a virtual bound state below the $πΣ$ threshold in addition to the established resonance pole just below the $\\bar{K}N$ threshold.

      "summary": "Electromagnetic dipole polarizabilities are fundamental properties of a hadron that represent its resistance to deformation under external fields. For a charged hadron, the presence of acceleration and Landau levels complicates the isolation of its deformation energy in the conventional background field method. In this work, we explore a general method based on four-point functions in lattice QCD that takes into account all photon, quark and gluon interactions. The electric polarizability ($α_E$) has been determined from the method in a previous proof-of-principle simulation. Here we focus on the magnetic polarizability ($β_M$) using the same quenched Wilson action on a $24^3\\times 48$ lattice at $β=6.0$ with pion mass from 1100 to 370 MeV. The results from the connected diagrams show a large cancellation between the elastic and inelastic contributions, leading to a relatively small and negative value for $β_M$ consistent with chiral perturbation theory. We also discuss the mechanism for $α_E+β_M$ from combining the two studies.",

Without fine-tuning, our model can reproduce the universal step-scaling function of the classical lattice XY model in the massive phase as we approach the phase transition. This is achieved by lowering the fugacity of Fock-vacuum sites in the loop-gas configuration space to zero in the thermodynamic limit. Some of the universal quantities at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition show smaller finite size effects in our model as compared to the traditional XY model. Our model is a prime example of qubit regularization of an asymptotically free massive quantum field theory in Euclidean space-time and helps understand how asymptotic freedom can arise as a relevant perturbation at a decoupled fixed point without fine-tuning.",

      "summary": "With the aim of studying nonperturbative out-of-equilibrium dynamics of high-energy particle collisions on quantum simulators, we investigate the scattering dynamics of lattice quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions. Working in the bosonized formulation of the model and in the thermodynamic limit, we use uniform-matrix-product-state tensor networks to construct multi-particle wave-packet states, evolve them in time, and detect outgoing particles post collision. This facilitates the numerical simulation of scattering experiments in both confined and deconfined regimes of the model at different energies, giving rise to rich phenomenology, including inelastic production of quark and meson states, meson disintegration, and dynamical string formation and breaking. We obtain elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections, together with time-resolved momentum and position distributions of the outgoing particles. Furthermore, we propose an analog circuit-QED implementation of the scattering process that is native to the platform, requires minimal ingredients and approximations, and enables practical schemes for particle wave-packet preparation and evolution. This study highlights the role of classical and quantum simulation in enhancing our understanding of scattering processes in quantum field theories in real time.",

      "summary": "We propose a new method to calculate parton distribution functions (PDFs) from lattice correlations of boosted quarks and gluons in the Coulomb gauge. Compared to the widely used gauge-invariant Wilson-line operators, these correlations greatly simplify the renormalization thanks to the absence of linear power divergence. Besides, they enable access to larger off-axis momenta under preserved 3D rotational symmetry, as well as enhanced long-range precision that facilitates the Fourier transform. We verify the factorization formula that relates this new observable to the quark PDF at one-loop order in perturbation theory. Moreover, through a lattice calculation of the pion valence quark PDF, we demonstrate the aforementioned advantage and features of the Coulomb gauge correlation and show that it yields consistent result with the gauge-invariant method. This opens the door to a more efficient way to calculate parton physics on the lattice.",

Given the calculated mass value $m_{η_{c1}}=4.329(36)$ GeV, the $η_{c1}$ decay is dominated by the open charm modes $D_1\\bar{D}$, $D^*\\bar{D}$ and $D^*\\bar{D}^*$ with partial widths of $258(133)$ MeV, $88(18)$ MeV and $150(118)$ MeV, respectively. The coupling of $η_{c1}$ to $χ_{c1}$ plus a flavor singlet pseudoscalar is not small, but $χ_{c1}η$ decay is suppressed by the small $η-η'$ mixing angle. The partial width of $η_{c1}\\to η_cη'$ is estimated to be around 1 MeV. We suggest experiments to search for $η_{c1}$ in the $P$-wave $D^*\\bar{D}$ and $D^*\\bar{D}^*$ systems.

      "summary": "Symplectic gauge theories coupled to matter fields lead to symmetry enhancement phenomena that have potential applications in such diverse contexts as composite Higgs, top partial compositeness, strongly interacting dark matter, and dilaton-Higgs models. These theories are also interesting on theoretical grounds, for example in reference to the approach to the large-N limit. A particularly compelling research aim is the determination of the extent of the conformal window in gauge theories with symplectic groups coupled to matter, for different groups and for field content consisting of fermions transforming in different representations. Such determination would have far-reaching implications, but requires overcoming huge technical challenges.\n  Numerical studies based on lattice field theory can provide the quantitative information necessary to this endeavour. We developed new software to implement symplectic groups in the Monte Carlo algorithms within the Grid framework. In this paper, we focus most of our attention on the Sp(4) lattice gauge theory coupled to four (Wilson-Dirac) fermions transforming in the 2-index antisymmetric representation, as a case study. We discuss an extensive catalogue of technical tests of the algorithms and present preliminary measurements to set the stage for future large-scale numerical investigations. We also include the scan of parameter space of all asymptotically free Sp(4) lattice gauge theories coupled to varying number of fermions transforming in the antisymmetric representation.",

To investigate this claim, we derive a general expression of the leading ISB correction to hadronic Fermi matrix elements, which takes the form of a four-point correlation function in lattice gauge theory and is straightforward to compute from first principles. Our formalism paves the way for the first determination of such correction in the neutron sector with fully-controlled theory uncertainties.",

A multilevel Monte Carlo method is proposed for this problem that uses different degree polynomials for the levels. The polynomials are developed from the GMRES algorithm for solving linear equations. To reduce orthogonalization expense, the highest degree polynomial is a composite or double polynomial found with a polynomial preconditioned GMRES iteration. Added to some of the Monte Carlo pieces is deflation of eigenvalues that reduces the variance. Deflation is also used for finding a reduced degree deflated polynomial. The new Multipolynomial Monte Carlo method can significantly improve the trace computation for matrices that have a difficult spectrum due to small eigenvalues.",

We employ several improvements to extend the range of available renormalized couplings, including the addition of heavy Pauli-Villars bosons to reduce cutoff effects and the combination of a range of gradient flow transformations. While in the weak coupling regime our result is consistent with those of earlier studies, our techniques allow us to study the system at much stronger couplings than previously possible. We find that the renormalization group $β$ function develops a zero, corresponding to an infrared-stable fixed point, at gradient-flow coupling $g^2=15.0(5)$. We also determine the mass and tensor anomalous dimensions: At the fixed point we find $γ_m\\simeq0.6$, suggesting that this system might be deep inside the conformal window.",

      "summary": "We present a lattice calculation of the $K\\toππ$ matrix elements and amplitudes with both the $ΔI = 3/2$ and 1/2 channels and $\\varepsilon'$, the measure of direct $CP$ violation. We use periodic boundary conditions (PBC), where the correct kinematics of $K\\toππ$ can be achieved via an excited two-pion final state. To overcome the difficulty associated with the extraction of excited states, our previous work \\cite{Bai:2015nea,RBC:2020kdj} successfully employed G-parity boundary conditions, where pions are forced to have non-zero momentum enabling the $I=0$ two-pion ground state to express the on-shell kinematics of the $K\\toππ$ decay. Here instead we overcome the problem using the variational method which allows us to resolve the two-pion spectrum and matrix elements up to the relevant energy where the decay amplitude is on-shell.\n  In this paper we report an exploratory calculation of $K\\toππ$ decay amplitudes and $\\varepsilon'$ using PBC on a coarser lattice size of $24^3\\times64$ with inverse lattice spacing $a^{-1}=1.023$ GeV and the physical pion and kaon masses. The results are promising enough to motivate us to continue our measurements on finer lattice ensembles in order to improve the precision in the near future.",

      "summary": "We calculate the soft function using lattice QCD in the framework of large momentum effective theory incorporating the one-loop perturbative contributions. The soft function is a crucial ingredient in the lattice determination of light cone objects using transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization. It consists of a rapidity-independent part called intrinsic soft function and a rapidity-dependent part called Collins-Soper kernel. We have adopted appropriate normalization when constructing the pseudo-scalar meson form factor that is needed in the determination of the intrinsic part and applied Fierz rearrangement to suppress the higher-twist effects. In the calculation of CS kernel we consider a CLS ensemble other than the MILC ensemble used in a previous study. We have also compared the applicability of determining the CS kernel using quasi TMDWFs and quasi TMDPDFs. As an example, the determined soft function is used to obtain the physical TMD wave functions (WFs) of pion and unpolarized iso-vector TMD parton distribution functions (PDFs) of proton.",

      "summary": "In lattice QCD, the calculation of physical quantities from disconnected quark loop calculations have large variance due to the use of Monte Carlo methods for the estimation of the trace of the inverse lattice Dirac operator. In this work, we build upon our POLY and HFPOLY variance reduction methods by using high-degree polynomials. Previously, the GMRES polynomials used were only stable for low-degree polynomials, but through application of a new, stable form of the GMRES polynomial, we have achieved higher polynomial degrees than previously used. While the variance is not dependent on the trace correction term within the methods, the evaluation of this term will be necessary for forming the vacuum expectation value estimates. This requires computing the trace of high-degree polynomials, which can be evaluated stochastically through our new Multipolynomial Monte Carlo method. With these new high-degree noise subtraction polynomials, we obtained a variance reduction for the scalar operator of nearly an order of magnitude over that of no subtraction on a $24^3 \\times 32$ quenched lattice at $β= 6.0$ and $κ= 0.1570 \\approx κ_{crit}$. Additionally, we observe that for sufficiently high polynomial degrees, POLY and HFPOLY approach the same level of effectiveness. We also explore the viability of using double polynomials for variance reduction as a means of reducing the required orthogonalization and memory costs associated with forming high-degree GMRES polynomials.",

One particularly interesting feature is the emergence of a relatively light, stable flavor-singlet scalar meson $σ$ $(J^{PC}=0^{++})$ in contrast to the $N_f=2$ theory QCD. In this work, we study the finite-volume dependence of the $σ$ meson correlation function computed in lattice gauge theory and determine the $σ$ meson mass and decay constant extrapolated to the infinite-volume limit. We also determine the infinite volume mass and decay constant of the flavor-nonsinglet scalar meson $a_0$.",

We calculate matrix elements with momentum-boosted proton states and a non-local axial operator. The calculation is performed using one ensemble of two degenerate light, a strange and a charm quark ($N_f=2+1+1$) of maximally twisted mass fermions with a clover term. The ensemble has a volume $32^3\\times64$, lattice spacing 0.0934 fm, and corresponds to a pion mass of 260 MeV. The matrix elements are calculated for three values of the proton momentum, namely 0.83, 1.25, and 1.67 GeV. The light-cone GPDs are defined in the symmetric frame, which we implement here with a (negative) 4-momentum transfer squared of 0.69, 1.38, and 2.76 GeV$^2$, all at zero skewness. We also conduct several consistency checks, including assessing the local limit of the twist-3 GPDs and examining the Burkhardt-Cottingham-type as well as Efremov-Teryaev-Leader-type sum rules.",

For this purpose, we use a previously developed modelling of GPDs based on machine learning techniques fulfilling the theoretical requirements of polynomiality, a form of positivity constraint and known reduction limits. A special care is given to estimate the uncertainty stemming from the ill-posed character of the connection between GPDs and the experimental processes usually considered to constrain them, like deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS). Mock lattice QCD data inputs are included in a Bayesian framework to the prior model which is fitted to reproduce the most experimentally accessible information of a phenomenological model by Goloskov and Kroll. We highlight the impact of the precision, correlation and kinematic coverage of lattice data on GPD extraction at moderate $ξ$ which has only been brushed in the literature so far, paving the way for a joint extraction of GPDs.",

This situation encourages the development of software featuring a HISQ action that is flexible, high-performing, open source, easy to use, and easy to adapt. In this technical paper, we explain the design strategy, provide implementation details, list available algorithms and modules, and show key performance indicators for SIMULATeQCD, a simple multi-GPU lattice code for large-scale QCD calculations, mainly developed and used by the HotQCD collaboration.

Often, it is useful to consider data subset selection at the same time, in which model selection criteria are used to compare models across different subsets of the data. Two different criteria have been proposed in the literature for how the data subsets should be weighted. We compare the two criteria closely in a unified treatment based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and conclude that one of them is subtly flawed and will tend to yield larger uncertainties due to loss of information.

We detail an algorithm to completely partition the full set of Pauli strings acting on any number of qubits into the minimal number of sets of commuting families, and we provide python code to perform the partitioning. The partitioning method scales linearly with the size of the set of Pauli strings and it naturally provides a fast method of diagonalizing the commuting families with quantum gates. We provide a package that integrates the partitioning into Qiskit, and use this to benchmark the algorithm with dense Hamiltonians, such as those that arise in matrix quantum mechanics models, on IBM hardware. We demonstrate computational speedups close to the theoretical limit of $(3/2)^m$ relative to qubit-wise commuting groupings, for $m=2,\\dotsc,6$ qubits.",

      "summary": "Staple-shaped Wilson line operators are necessary for the study of transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) in lattice QCD and beyond. In this work, we study the renormalization of such operators in the general case of an asymmetric staple. We analyze the mixing pattern of these operators using their symmetry properties, where we find that the possible mixing is restricted within groups of four operators. We then present numerical results using the regularization independent momentum subtraction (RI/MOM) scheme to study the importance of mixing using one operator in particular, the $γ_0$ operator. Based on these results, we consider the short distance ratio (SDR) scheme, which is desirable in the absence of mixing. Finally, we investigate a variant of the RI/MOM scheme, where the renormalization factors are computed at short distances.",

      "summary": "We present results for the isovector axial vector form factors obtained using thirteen 2+1+1-flavor highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration. The calculation of nucleon two- and three-point correlation functions has been done using Wilson-clover fermions. In the analysis of these data, we quantify the sensitivity of the results to strategies used for removing excited state contamination and invoke the partially conserved axial current relation between the form factors to choose between them. Our data driven analysis includes removing contributions from multihadron $N π$ states that make significant contributions. Our final results are: $g_A = 1.292 (53)_\\text{stat}\\,(24)_\\text{sys}$ for the axial charge; $g_S = 1.085 (50)_\\text{stat}\\, (103)_\\text{sys}$ and $g_T = 0.991 (21)_\\text{stat}\\, (10)_\\text{sys}$ for the scalar and tensor charges; $\\langle r_A^2 \\rangle = 0.439 (56)_\\text{stat} (34)_\\text{sys}$ fm${}^2$ for the mean squared axial charge radius, $g_P^\\ast = 9.03(47)_\\text{stat}(42)_\\text{sys} $ for the induced pseudoscalar charge; and $g_{πNN} = 14.14(81)_\\text{stat}(85)_\\text{sys}$ for the pion-nucleon coupling. We also provide a parameterization of the axial form factor $G_A(Q^2)$ over the range $0 \\le Q^2 \\le 1$ GeV${}^2$ for use in phenomenology and a comparison with other lattice determinations.

      "summary": "For the first time, we present a lattice QCD determination of Mellin moments of unpolarized generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the proton from an analysis of the quasi-GPD matrix elements within the short-distance factorization framework. We perform our calculation on an $N_f$=2+1+1 twisted mass fermions ensemble with a clover improvement at lattice spacing $a=0.093$ fm and a pion mass of $m_π=260$ MeV. Focusing on the zero-skewness case, the iso-vector and iso-scalar quasi-GPDs are calculated from the $γ_0$ definition, as well as a recently proposed Lorentz-invariant definition. We utilize data on both symmetric and asymmetric kinematic frames, which allows us to obtain the Mellin moments for several values of the momentum transfer, $-t$, in the range 0.17 to $2.77~\\rm{GeV}^2$. We use the ratio scheme for GPDs, i.e. renormalization group invariant ratios with leading-twist factorization formula and perturbatively calculated matching coefficients up to the next-next-to-leading order (NNLO) to extract Mellin moments of GPDs, which are consistent with renormalization-group improved results. We compare our determination from quasi-GPDs with the results extracted using standard calculations of Mellin moments of local operators, specifically those related to the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors. We estimated the moments of GPDs up to the fifth ones for the first time. By extrapolating the Mellin moments to $-t=0$, we obtained the quark charges, momentum fraction, as well as the angular momentum contributions to the proton spin. The impact parameter space interpretation of the GPD moments is discussed, which provides insights into the spatial distribution of unpolarized quarks and their correlations in the transverse plane of an unpolarized or transversely polarized proton.",

      "summary": "Macroscopic properties of the strong interaction near its chiral phase transition exhibit scaling behaviors, which are the same as those observed close to the magnetic transition in a 3-dimensional classical spin system with $O(4)$ symmetry. We show that the universal scaling properties of the chiral phase transition in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at the macroscale are, in fact, encoded within the microscopic energy levels of its fundamental constituents, the quarks. We establish a connection between the cumulants of the chiral order parameter, i.e., the chiral condensate, and the correlations among the energy levels of quarks, i.e., the eigenspectra of the massless QCD Dirac operator. This relation elucidates how the fluctuations of the chiral condensate arise from the correlations within the infrared part of the energy spectra of quarks, and naturally leads to a generalization of the Banks-Casher relation for the cumulants of the chiral condensate. Then, through (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD calculations with varying light quark masses near the QCD chiral transition, we demonstrate that the correlations among the infrared part of the Dirac eigenvalue spectra exhibit same universal scaling behaviors as expected of the cumulants of the chiral condensate. We find that these universal scaling behaviors extend up to the physical values of the up and down quark masses. Our study reveals how the hidden scaling features at the microscale give rise to the macroscopic universal properties of QCD.",

      "summary": "A new thermal regime of QCD, featuring decoupled scale-invariant infrared glue, has been proposed to exist both in pure-glue (N$_f$=0) and ``real-world\" (N$_f$=2+1 at physical quark masses) QCD. In this {\\it IR phase}, elementary degrees of freedom flood the infrared, forming a distinct component independent from the bulk. This behavior necessitates non-analyticities in the theory. In pure-glue QCD, such non-analyticities have been shown to arise via Anderson-like mobility edges in Dirac spectra ($λ_{\\rm IR} \\!=\\! 0$, $\\pm λ_\\text{A} \\!\\neq\\! 0$), as manifested in the dimension function $d_{\\rm IR} (λ)$. Here, we present the first evidence, based on lattice QCD calculation at $a$=0.105 fm, that this mechanism is also at work in real-world QCD, thus supporting the existence of the proposed IR regime in nature. An important aspect of our results is that, while at $T\\!=\\!234\\,$MeV we find a dimensional jump between zero modes and lowest near-zero modes very close to unity ($d_{\\rm IR} \\!=\\!3$ to $d_{\\rm IR} \\!\\simeq\\! 2$), similar to the IR phase of pure-glue QCD, at $T\\!=\\!187\\,$MeV we observe a continuous $λ$-dependence. This suggests that thermal states just {\\it above} the chiral crossover are non-analytically (in $T$) connected to thermal state at $T\\!=\\!234\\,$MeV, supporting the key original proposition that the transition into the IR regime occurs at a temperature strictly above the chiral crossover.",

Previously we studied this process with quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and showed that it can be factorized with the gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in the heavy quark limit. We further argued that the hadronic matrix element is dominated by its leading moments corresponding to the gluonic gravitational form factors (GFFs) in this limit. Since then, there have been many new developments on this subject. More experimental measurements have been made and published, and the lattice simulation of gluonic GFFs has been improved as well. In this work, we make an important revision to a previous result and perform an updated analysis with the new inputs. We also study the importance of the large momentum transfer to extract these gluonic structures reliably in this framework.",

For lattice data with hadron momentum $P^z$ of a few GeV, this correction is dominant in matching, as large as 30\\% or more. We show how to eliminate this uncertainty through choosing the mass renormalization parameter consistently with the resummation scheme of the infrared-renormalon series in perturbative matching coefficients. An example on the lattice pion PDF data at $P^z = 1.9$ GeV shows an improvement of matching accuracy by a factor of more than $3\\sim 5$ in the expansion region $x= 0.2\\sim 0.5$.",

We provide a complete parametrization of the form factors that includes both single and double-virtual kinematics. Our results are compared with experimental measurements of the form factors in the space-like region and with the measured two-photon decay widths. In a second step, our parametrizations of the transition form factors are used to compute the dominant pseudoscalar-pole contributions to the hadronic light-by-light scattering in the muon $g-2$. Our final result reads $a_μ^{\\rm hlbl, ps-pole} = (85.1 \\pm 5.2) \\times 10^{-11}$. Although the pion-pole is dominant, we confirm that, together, the $η$ and $η^{\\prime}$ provide roughly half of its contribution.",

      "summary": "Parton distribution functions (PDFs) at large $x$ are poorly constrained by high-energy experimental data, but extremely important for probing physics beyond standard model at colliders. We study the calculation of PDFs at large-$x$ through large-momentum $P^z$ expansion of the lattice quasi PDFs. Similar to deep-inelastic scattering, there are two distinct perturbative scales in the threshold limit where the matching coefficient can be factorized into a space-like jet function at scale $P^z|1-y|$ and a pair of heavy-light Sudakov form factors at scale $P^z$. The matching formula allows us to derive a full renormalization group resummation of large threshold logarithms, and the result is consistent with the known calculation to the next-to-next to leading order (NNLO). This paves the way for direct large-$x$ PDFs calculations in lattice QCD. As by-products, we find that the space-like jet function is related to a time-like version calculated previously through analytic continuation, and the heavy-light Sudakov form factor, calculated here to NNLO, is a universal object appearing as well in the large momentum expansion of quasi transverse-momentum-dependent PDFs and quasi wave-function amplitudes.",

We focus on the light composite states emerging from these studies, consisting of a set of pseudoscalars and a single light scalar. We first consider the view that this theory is just outside the conformal window. In this case, the pseudoscalars arise from spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. Identifying the scalar in this case as an approximate dilaton, we fit the lattice data to a dilaton effective field theory, finding that it yields a good fit even at lowest order. For comparison, we then consider the possibility that the theory is inside the conformal window. The fermion mass provides a deformation, triggering confinement. We employ simple scaling laws to fit the lattice data, and find that it is of lesser quality.",

      "summary": "One of the sensitive probes of physics beyond the standard model is the test of the unitarity of the Cabbibo-Kobyashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. Current analysis of the first row is based on $|V_{ud}|$ from fourteen superallowed $0^+ \\to 0^+$ nuclear $β$ decays and $|V_{ud}|$ from the kaon semileptonic decay, $K \\to π\\ell ν_\\ell$. Modeling the nuclear effects in the $0^+ \\to 0^+$ decays is a major source of uncertainty, which would be absent in neutron decays. To make neutron decay competitive requires improving the measurement of neutron lifetime and the axial charge, as well as the calculation of the radiative corrections (RC) to the decay. The largest uncertainty in these RCs, which comes from the non-perturbative part of the $γW$-box diagram and its evaluation using lattice QCD, is still not under control. Here, we show that the analogous calculations for the pion and kaon decays are robust and give $\\square_{γW}^{VA}|_π = 2.810 (26) \\times 10^{-3}$ and $\\square_{γW}^{VA}|_{K^{0, S U(3)}} = 2.389 (17) \\times 10^{-3}$ in agreement with the previous analysis carried out by Feng et al. using a different discretization of the fermion action.",

We compute masses of quarkonium and triply-heavy baryons in order to study the perturbative convergence of pNRQCD and validate our numerical methods. Further, we study $SU(N_c)$ models of composite dark matter and provide simple power series fits to our pNRQCD results that can be used to relate dark meson and baryon masses to the fundamental parameters of these models. For many systems comprised entirely of heavy quarks, the quantum Monte Carlo methods employed here are less computationally demanding than lattice field theory methods, although they introduce additional perturbative approximations. The formalism presented here may therefore be particularly useful for predicting composite dark matter properties for a wide range of $N_c$ and heavy fermion masses.",

We illustrate the process using Belle data for $B\\rightarrow D\\ell ν_\\ell$. For this specific example, the metrics provide consistent indications that some choices (order of truncation, BGL or BCL) made in the form of the $z$-expansion can be optimized.

      "summary": "We use lattice simulations and the continuous renormalization-group method, based on the gradient flow, to study a candidate theory of composite Higgs and a partially composite top. The model is an SU(4) gauge theory with four Dirac fermions in each of the fundamental and two-index antisymmetric representations. We find that the theory has an infrared fixed point at $g^2 \\simeq 15.5$ in the gradient flow scheme. The mass anomalous dimension of each representation is large at the fixed point. On the other hand, the anomalous dimensions of top-partner operators do not exceed 0.5 at the fixed point. This may not be large enough for a phenomenologically successful model of partial compositeness.",

      "summary": "We present a lattice QCD study of the contribution of the isovector quark chromo-electric dipole moment (qcEDM) operator to the nucleon electric dipole moments (nEDM). The calculation was carried out on four 2+1+1-flavor of highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) ensembles using Wilson-clover quarks to construct correlation functions. This clover-on-HISQ formulation is not fully $O(a)$ improved, and gives rise to additional systematics over and above those due to removing excited state contributions to getting ground-state matrix elements, and the final chiral and continuum extrapolations to get the physical result. We use the non-singlet axial Ward identity including corrections up to $O(a)$ to show how to control the power-divergent mixing of the isovector qcEDM operator with the lower dimensional pseudoscalar operator. The residual corrections are observed to give rise to $O(25\\%)$ violations in relations arising from the axial Ward identity. We devise three methods attempting to control the resulting uncertainty in the CP violating form factor; each of these, however, can have large $O(a^2)$ corrections. Preliminary results for the nEDM due to qcEDM are presented choosing the method giving the most uniform behavior.",

A number of collaborations have performed, or are performing, such computations. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework, based on Infinite-Volume Reconstruction (IVR), for the computation of electromagnetic corrections to leptonic decay widths. In this method, the hadronic correlation functions are first processed theoretically in infinite volume, in such a way that the required matrix elements can be determined non-perturbatively from lattice QCD computations with finite-volume uncertainties which are exponentially small in the volume. The cancellation of infrared divergences in this framework is performed fully analytically. We also outline how this IVR treatment can be extended to determine the QED effects in semi-leptonic kaon decays with a similar degree of accuracy.",

      "summary": "When observing a quantum field via detectors with access to only the mixed states of spatially separated, local regions -- a ubiquitous experimental design -- the capacity to access the full extent of distributed entanglement can be limited, shrouded by classical correlations. By performing projective measurements of the field external to two detection patches and classically communicating the results, underlying pure states may be identified for which entanglement quantification is clear. In the Gaussian continuous-variable states of the free scalar field vacuum, this protocol uncovers a disparity between the spacelike entanglement established within the field and that which is locally detectable. This discrepancy is found to grow exponentially with the separation between observation regions. The protocol developed herein offers insight and practical guidance for clarifying the unavoidable distortion of quantum field correlations when viewed from the vantage of a pair of local observers.",

      "summary": "Numerical computations in strongly-interacting quantum field theories are often performed using Monte-Carlo sampling methods. A key task in these calculations is to estimate the value of a given physical quantity from the distribution of stochastic samples that are generated using the Monte-Carlo method. Typically, the sample mean and sample variance are used to define the expectation values and uncertainties of computed quantities. However, the Monte-Carlo sample distribution contains more information than these basic properties and it is useful to investigate it more generally. In this work, the exact form of the probability distributions of two-point correlation functions at zero momentum in O(N) lattice field theories in the disordered phase and in infinite volume are determined. These distributions allow for a robust investigation of the efficacy of the Monte-Carlo sampling procedure and are shown also to allow for improved estimators of the target physical quantity to be constructed. The theoretical expectations are shown to agree with numerical calculations in the O(2) model.",

This becomes a particular problem when extrapolated far from real energies, e.g. in the case of broad resonances like the $σ$, leading to large systematic uncertainties in the pole position. In this manuscript, we will show how dispersion relations can implement the additional constraints, using as input lattice--determined $ππ$ partial-wave scattering amplitudes with isospin--0,1,2. We will show that only certain combinations of amplitude parameterizations satisfy all constraints, and that when we restrict to these, the $σ$ pole position is determined with minimal systematic uncertainty. The evolution of the now well-constrained $σ$ pole with varying light quark mass is presented, showing how it transitions from a bound-state to a broad resonance.",

With the development of sophisticated techniques such as distillation, it is possible to carefully study two-pion scattering in order to constrain associated low-energy constants. In this work, correlation functions with multiparticle interpolating operators are constructed to compute pion scattering phase shifts and scattering lengths in the isospin 0 and 2 channels with both sea and valence quarks at physical mass. Contamination from vacuum and thermal contributions are explicitly quantified with dedicated calculations and the results obtained after subtracting these nuisance terms are compared with the traditional correlator time series subtraction method. Two physical point ensembles with different lattice actions are used, and our finest ensemble gives results for scattering lengths and phase shifts consistent with phenomenology to within the reported statistical uncertainty.",

Understanding TMDs requires a combination of theoretical techniques from quantum field theory, nonperturbative calculations using lattice QCD, and phenomenological analysis of experimental data. The handbook covers a wide range of topics, from theoretical foundations to experimental analyses, as well as recent developments and future directions.

Controlling the GFMC fermion-sign problem is crucial, as the signal-to-noise ratio decreases exponentially with Euclidean time, requiring significant computing resources. Inspired by similar scenarios in lattice quantum field theory and spin systems, in this work, we employ integration contour deformations to improve the GFMC signal-to-noise ratio. Machine learning techniques are used to select optimal contours with minimal variance from parameterized families of deformations. As a proof of principle, we consider the deuteron binding energies and Euclidean density response functions. We only observe mild signal-to-noise improvement for the binding energy case. On the other hand, we achieve an order of magnitude reduction of the variance for Euclidean density response functions, paving the way for computing electron- and neutrino-nucleus cross-sections of larger nuclei.",

Results for the scaling functions are fitted to the Widom-Griffiths form, using a parametrization also used in analytic calculations. We find good agreement on the level of scaling functions and the location of maxima in the universal part of susceptibilities. We also find that an earlier parametrization of the $O(4)$ scaling function, using 14 parameters, is well reproduced when using the Widom-Griffiths form with only three parameters. We furthermore show that finite size corrections to the scaling functions are distinctively different in the $Z(2)$ and $O(N)$ universality classes and determine the volume dependence of the peak locations in order parameter and mixed susceptibilities.",

We have focused on the three color theory on lattices of size $12^4$ and for 't Hooft couplings up to $λ=40.0$. Our lattice action is based on a discretization of the Marcus or GL twist of $N=4$ SYM and retains one exact supersymmetry for non-zero lattice spacing. We show that lattice theory exists in a single non-Abelian Coulomb phase for all 't Hooft couplings. Furthermore the static potential we obtain from correlators of Polyakov lines is in good agreement with that obtained from holography - specifically the potential has a Coulombic form with a coefficent that varies as the square root of the 't Hooft coupling.",

Results for the CKM matrix element may also shed light on the discrepancies seen between analyses of inclusive or exclusive decays. We calculate the decay form factors using lattice QCD with domain-wall light quarks and a relativistic $b$-quark. We analyze data at three lattice spacings with unitary pion masses down to $268\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$. Our numerical results are interpolated/extrapolated to physical quark masses and to the continuum to obtain the vector and scalar form factors $f_+(q^2)$ and $f_0(q^2)$ with full error budgets at $q^2$ values spanning the range accessible in our simulations. We provide a possible explanation of tensions found between results for the form factor from different lattice collaborations. Model- and truncation-independent $z$-parameterization fits following a recently proposed Bayesian-inference approach extend our results to the entire allowed kinematic range. Our results can be combined with experimental measurements of $B_s \\to D_s$ and $B_s\\to K$ semileptonic decays to determine $|V_{ub}|=3.8(6)\\times 10^{-3}$. The error is currently dominated by experiment. We compute differential branching fractions and two types of $R$ ratios, the one commonly used as well as a variant better suited to test lepton-flavor universality.",

We confirm expectations of weak repulsion in isospin--2, and the presence of a narrow $ρ$ resonance in isospin--1, and study the pion mass dependence of these channels. In isospin--0 we find that the two pion masses considered straddle the point at which the $σ$ transitions from being a stable bound-state to being either a virtual bound-state or a subthreshold resonance. We discuss the ability of lattice calculations like these to precisely determine the $σ$ pole location when it is a resonance, and propose an approach in which the full complement of amplitudes computed in this paper can be used simultaneously to provide more constraint.",

Extending techniques from the non-relativistic three-body scattering theory, we provide a detailed and general prescription for solving and analytically continuing integral equations describing the three-body reactions. We use these techniques to study a system with zero angular momenta described by a single scattering length leading to a bound state in a two-body sub-channel. We obtain bound-state--particle and three-particle amplitudes in the previously unexplored kinematical regime; in particular, for real energies below elastic thresholds and complex energies in the physical and unphysical Riemann sheets. We extract positions of three-particle bound-states that agree with previous finite-volume studies, providing further evidence for the consistency of the relativistic finite-volume three-body quantization conditions. We also determine previously unobserved virtual bound states in this theory. Finally, we find numerical evidence of the breakdown of the two-body finite-volume formalism in the vicinity of the left-hand cuts and argue for the generalization of the existing formalism.",

The algorithm is used to compute $π$ with and without a sign problem, a toy U(1) gauge theory model, and the Ising model. The effect of $R_{Z}$-gate synthesis errors on a future fault-tolerant quantum computer is investigated.",

      "summary": "When simulating a lattice system near its critical temperature, local algorithms for modeling the system's evolution can introduce very large autocorrelation times into sampled data. This critical slowing down places restrictions on the analysis that can be completed in a timely manner of the behavior of systems around the critical point. Because it is often desirable to study such systems around this point, a new algorithm must be introduced. Therefore, we turn to cluster algorithms, such as the Swendsen-Wang algorithm and the Wolff clustering algorithm. They incorporate global updates which generate new lattice configurations with little correlation to previous states, even near the critical point. We look to accelerate the rate at which these algorithm are capable of running by implementing and benchmarking a parallel implementation of each algorithm designed to run on GPUs under NVIDIA's CUDA framework. A 17 and 90 fold increase in the computational rate was respectively experienced when measured against the equivalent algorithm implemented in serial code.",

Utilizing the stochastic LapH method, we determine the spectrum of these systems on two CLS $N_f=2+1$ ensembles with pion masses of $200$ MeV and $340$ MeV, and include many levels in different momentum frames. We constrain the K matrices describing two- and three-particle interactions by fitting the spectrum to the results predicted by the finite-volume formalism, including up to $p$ waves. This requires also results for the $π^+π^+$ and $K^+ K^+$ spectrum, which have been obtained previously on the same configurations. We explore different fitting strategies, comparing fits to energy shifts with fits to energies boosted to the rest frame, and also comparing simultaneous global fits to all relevant two- and three-particle channels to those where we first fit two-particle channels and then add in the three-particle information. We provide the first determination of the three-particle K matrix in $π^+π^+K^+$ and $K^+ K^+ π^+$ systems, finding statistically significant nonzero results in most cases. We include $s$ and $p$ waves in the K matrix for $π^+ K^+$ scattering, finding evidence for an attractive $p$-wave scattering length. We compare our results to Chiral Perturbation Theory, including an investigation of the impact of discretization errors, for which we provide the leading order predictions obtained using Wilson Chiral Perturbation Theory.",

We derive the scale invariant expression for the pressure from the gravitational form factors (GFF) of QCD which results in consistent results for the mass and rest energy from the GFF and those from the trace and the Hamiltonian of the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) operators. It is shown that the energy-equilibrium correspondence of hadrons infers an equation of state where the trace anomaly matrix element, emerging from the glue condensate in the vacuum, gives a negative constant pressure that leads to confinement, much like the confinement mechanism for the vortices in type II superconductors where the negative constant pressure is due to the cost of depleting the superconducting condensate. We also note that both the trace anomaly in the QCD energy-momentum tensor and the cosmological constant in Einstein's equation are associated with the metric term which contributes to both energy and pressure. Their difference in terms of the role the pressure plays is discussed. Finally, we note that a lattice calculation of the trace anomaly distribution in the pion has addressed a question about the trace anomaly contribution to the pion mass and suggests that there might be a connection between the conformal symmetry breaking and chiral symmetry breaking in this case.",

Specifically, we study a chemical potential tuned quantum phase transition, along which we track the emergence of quasi-long-range order and critical softening of the single particle gap.

Numerical simulations are based on one ensemble with 2+1+1 flavors of highly improved staggered quarks action with lattice spacing $a=0.121$~fm from the MILC Collaboration, and one with 2 +1 flavor clover fermions and tree-level Symanzik gauge action generated by the CLS Collaboration with $a=0.098$~fm. As a key ingredient, the soft function is first obtained by incorporating the one-loop perturbative contributions and a proper normalization. Based on this and the equal-time quasi-TMDWFs simulated on the lattice, we extract the light-cone TMDWFs. The results are comparable between the two lattice ensembles and a comparison with phenomenological parametrization is made. Our studies provide a first attempt of $ab$ $initio$ calculation of TMDWFs which will eventually lead to crucial theory inputs for making predictions for exclusive processes under QCD factorization.",

Using chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order, volume effects are calculated for thermodynamic quantities: the chiral condensate, pressure anisotropy, and magnetization. The neutral pion effective action in a finite volume is additionally derived. For these charge neutral observables, volume and source averaging are shown to capitalize on magnetic periodicity, which is the remnant translational invariance of the finite-volume theory. For a fixed magnetic field strength, certain volume and source averaged quantities are independent of the size of the lattice transverse to the magnetic field. Despite this simplifying feature, finite volume corrections to the magnetic field dependence of the chiral condensate and neutral pion magnetic polarizability can be non-negligible. The pressure anisotropy at fixed magnetic flux, moreover, appears acutely sensitive to the lattice volume.",

In this Letter, we calculate the CS kernel for pion and proton targets and for quasi-TMDPDFs of leading and next-to-leading power. The calculations are carried out on the CLS ensemble H101 with dynamical $N_f=2+1$ clover-improved Wilson fermions. Our analyses demonstrate the consistency of different lattice extractions of the CS kernel for mesons and baryons, as well as for twist-two and twist-three operators, even though lattice artifacts could be significant. This consistency corroborates the universality of the lattice-determined CS kernel and suggests that a high-precision determination of it is in reach.",

      "summary": "On configurations with 2+1-flavor dynamical domain-wall fermions, we calculate the RI/(S)MOM renormalization constants (RC) of overlap quark bilinears. Hypercubic (HYP) smearing is used to construct the overlap Dirac operator. We investigate the possible effects of the smearing on discretization errors in the RCs by varying the level of smearing from 0 to 1 and 2. The lattice is of size $32^3\\times64$ and with lattice spacing $1/a=2.383(9)$ GeV. The RCs in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme at 2 GeV are given at the end, with the uncertainty of $Z_T$ reaching $\\le1$% for the tensor current. Results of the renormalized quark masses and hadron matrix elements show that the renormalization procedure suppresses the $\\sim$ 30% difference of the bare quantities with or without HYP smearing into the 3%-5% level.",

      "summary": "We present a study of lattice-QCD methods to determine the relevant hadronic form factors for radiative leptonic decays of pseudoscalar mesons. We provide numerical results for $D_s^+ \\to \\ell^+ νγ$. Our calculation is performed using a domain-wall action for all quark flavors and on a single RBC/UKQCD lattice gauge-field ensemble. The first part of the study is how to best control two sources of systematic error inherent in the calculation, specifically the unwanted excited states created by the meson interpolating field, and unwanted exponentials in the sum over intermediate states. Using a 3d sequential propagator allows for better control over unwanted exponentials from intermediate states, while using a 4d sequential propagator allows for better control over excited states. We perform individual analyses of the 3d and 4d methods as well as a combined analysis using both methods, and find that the 3d sequential propagator offers good control over both sources of systematic uncertainties for the smallest number of propagator solves. From there, we further improve the use of a 3d sequential propagator by employing an infinite-volume approximation method, which allows us to calculate the relevant form factors over the entire allowed range of photon energies. We then study improvements gained by performing the calculation using a different three-point function, using ratios of three-point functions, averaging over positive and negative photon momentum, and using an improved method for extracting the structure-dependent part of the axial form factor. The optimal combination of methods yields results for the $D_s^+ \\to \\ell^+ νγ$ structure-dependent vector and axial form factors in the entire kinematic range with statistical plus fitting uncertainties of order 5%, using 25 gauge configurations with 64 samples per configuration.",

A leading renormalon resummation in renormalization as well as the perturbative matching kernel in the framework of large momentum expansion generates the power accuracy of the matching to the light-cone amplitude. Meanwhile, a small momentum log resummation is implemented for both the quark momentum $xP_z$ and the antiquark momentum $(1-x)P_z$ inside a meson of boost momentum $P_z$ up to 1.72 GeV along the $z$ direction, allowing us to have more accurate determination of the $x$-dependence in the middle range. Finally, we use the complementarity between the short-distance factorization and the large momentum expansion to constrain the endpoint regions $x\\sim 0, 1$, thus obtaining the full-range $x$-dependence of the amplitude.",

      "summary": "A study of two-pion scattering for the isospin channels, $I=0$ and $I=2$, using lattice QCD is presented. Möbius domain wall fermions on top of the Iwasaki-DSDR gauge action for gluons with periodic boundary conditions are used for the lattice computations which are carried out on two ensembles of gauge field configurations generated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations with physical masses, inverse lattice spacings of 1.023 and 1.378 GeV, and spatial extents of $L=4.63$ and 4.58 fm, respectively. The all-to-all propagator method is employed to compute a matrix of correlation functions of two-pion operators. The generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) is solved for a matrix of correlation functions to extract phase shifts with multiple states, two pions with a non-zero relative momentum as well as two pions at rest. Our results for phase shifts for both $I=0$ and $I=2$ channels are consistent with and the Roy Equation and chiral perturbation theory, though at this preliminary stage our errors for $I=0$ are large. An important outcome of this work is that we are successful in extracting two-pion excited states, which are useful for studying $K\\toππ$ decay, on physical-mass ensembles using GEVP.",

Our calculation uses the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action for sea and valence quarks, and ensembles with up, down, strange, and charm quarks in the sea. Using a highly improved action with the MILC Collaboration's gauge ensembles with lattice spacings down to $a\\approx0.03$ fm, allows the heavy valence quarks to be treated with the same discretization as the light and strange quarks. This unified treatment of the valence quarks allows for absolutely normalized vector currents, bypassing the need for perturbative matching, which has been a source of uncertainty in previous calculations of $B$-meson decay form factors by our collaboration.

      "summary": "We present a lattice-QCD calculation of the light-quark connected contribution to window observables associated with the leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_μ^{\\mathrm{HVP,LO}}$. We employ the MILC Collaboration's isospin-symmetric QCD gauge-field ensembles, which contain four flavors of dynamical highly-improved-staggered quarks with four lattice spacings between $a\\approx 0.06$-$0.15$~fm and close-to-physical quark masses. We consider several effective-field-theory-based schemes for finite-volume and other lattice corrections and combine the results via Bayesian model averaging to obtain robust estimates of the associated systematic uncertainties. After unblinding, our final results for the intermediate and ``W2'' windows are $a^{ll,{\\mathrm W}}_μ(\\mathrm{conn.})=206.6(1.0) \\times 10^{-10}$ and $a^{ll,\\mathrm {W2}}_μ(\\mathrm{conn.}) = 100.7(3.2)\\times 10^{-10}$, respectively.",

      "summary": "This talk summarizes the progress made since Lattice 2021 in understanding and controlling the contributions of towers of multihadron excited states with mass gaps starting lower than of radial excitations, and in increasing our confidence in the extraction of ground state nucleon matrix elements. The most clear evidence for multihadron excited state contributions (ESC) is in axial/pseudoscalar form factors that are required to satisfy the PCAC relation between them. The talk examines the broader question--which and how many of the theoretically allowed positive parity states $N(\\textbf p)π(-\\textbf p)$, $N(\\textbf 0)π(\\textbf 0)π(\\textbf 0)$, $N(\\textbf p)π(\\textbf 0)$, $N(\\textbf 0)π(\\textbf p),\\ \\ldots$ make significant contributions to a given nucleon matrix element? New data for the axial, electric and magnetic form factors are presented. They continue to show trends observed in Ref[1]. The N${}^2$LO $χ$PT analysis of the ESC to the pion-nucleon sigma term, $σ_{πN}$, has been extended to include the $Δ$ as an explicit degree of freedom [2]. The conclusion reached in Ref [3] that $N π$ and $N ππ$ states each contribute about 10 MeV to $σ_{πN}$, and the consistency between the lattice result with $N π$ state included and the phenomenological estimate is not changed by this improvement.",

In particular, we consider the Taylor coupling given by the product of ghost and gluon dressing functions. Assuming spectral representations for the latter, we first show that also the coupling obeys such a representation. The subsequent spectral reconstruction of the coupling data, obtained from 2+1 flavour lattice QCD results for the ghost and gluon, is based on a probabilistic inversion of this representation using Gaussian process regression with analytically enforced asymptotics. In contradistinction, our direct calculation relies on earlier reconstruction results for the ghost and gluon spectral functions themselves, as well as data obtained in functional QCD. Apart from its relevance for studies of resonances or scattering processes, the calculation also serves as a non-trivial benchmark of our reconstruction approach. The results show remarkable agreement, testifying to the reliability of the method.",

      "summary": "We test here our recently introduced new lattice method for the $β$-function defined over infinite Euclidean space-time in the continuum from scale changes generated by infinitesimal or finite steps of the renormalized gauge coupling on the gradient flow. Harlander and Neumann calculated in this scheme the three-loop approximation to the continuum $β$-function. Our goal is the nonperturbative lattice implementation of the scheme which we tested originally in the chiral limit of the sextet model and in multi-flavor QCD with ten and twelve flavors of massless fermions. Results are reported here in the SU(3) Yang-Mills gauge sector without dynamical fermions and in ten-flavor QCD with massless femions. The three-loop gradient flow based $β$-function of Harlander and Neumann is used to connect the $Λ_{\\overline{\\rm MS}}$ scale of the SU(3) Yang-Mills gauge theory with the nonperturbative flow time scale $t_0$, or the equivalent Sommer scale $r_0$. Similarly, the $Λ_{\\overline{\\rm MS}}$ scale is connected with a selected nonperturbative scale in the ten-flavor theory, a pilot study of our new lattice based nonperturbative $β$-function for high precision determination of the strong coupling $α_s$ at the Z-boson pole in QCD with three massless fermion flavors. This goal is an important alternative to results from the finite volume based step $β$-function of the Alpha collaboration. Work is ongoing on direct application of the method to QCD with three massless fermion flavors.",

Snowmass 2021 was a scientific study that provided an opportunity for the entire U.S. particle physics community, along with its international partners, to identify the most important scientific questions in High Energy Physics for the following decade, with an eye to the decade after that, and the experiments, facilities, infrastructure, and R&D needed to pursue them. This Snowmass summary report synthesizes the lessons learned and the main conclusions of the Community Planning Exercise as a whole and presents a community-informed synopsis of U.S. particle physics at the beginning of 2023. This document, along with the Snowmass reports from the various subfields, will provide input to the 2023 Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) subpanel of the U.S. High-Energy Physics Advisory Panel (HEPAP), and will help to guide and inform the activity of the U.S. particle physics community during the next decade and beyond.",

      "summary": "Gauge covariant smearing based on the 3D lattice Laplacian can be used to create extended operators that have better overlap with hadronic ground states. For staggered quarks, we make use of two-link parallel transport to preserve taste properties. We have implemented the procedure in QUDA. We present the performance of this code on the NVIDIA A100 GPUs in Indiana University's Big Red 200 supercomputer and on the AMD MI250X GPUs in Oak Ridge Leadership Computer Facility's (OLCF's) Crusher and discuss its scalability. We also study the performance improvement from using NVSHMEM on OLCF's Summit. Reusing precomputed two-link products for all sources and sinks, it reduces the total smearing time for a baryon correlator measurement by a factor of 100-120 as compared with the original MILC code and reduces the overall time by 60-70%.",

      "summary": "Polarizabilities reveal valuable information on the internal structure of hadrons in terms of charge and current distributions. For neutral hadrons, the standard approach is the background field method. But for a charged hadron, its acceleration under the applied field complicates the isolation of the polarization energy. In this work, we explore an alternative method based on four-point functions in lattice QCD. The approach offers a transparent picture on how polarizabilities arise from photon, quark, and gluon interactions. We carry out a proof-of-concept simulation on the electric polarizability of a charged pion, using quenched Wilson action on a $24^3\\times 48$ lattice at $β=6.0$ with pion mass from 1100 to 370 MeV. We show in detail the evaluation and analysis of the four-point correlation functions and report results on charge radius and electric polarizability. Our results from connected diagrams suggest that charged pion $α_E$ is due to a cancellation between elastic and inelastic contributions. It would be interesting to see how the cancellation plays out at smaller pion masses in future simulations.",

      "title": "Neutrino Oscillation and Lattice QCD",
      "summary": "Next generation high-precision neutrino scattering experiments have the goal of measuring the as-of-yet unknown parameters governing neutrino oscillation. This effort is hampered by the use of large nuclear targets: secondary interactions within a nucleus can confuse the interpretation of experimental data, leading to ambiguities about the initial neutrino interaction in scattering events. The distribution of energies for neutrino events must instead be inferred from the responses of a sum of dissimilar event topologies. For this reason, precise neutrino cross sections on nucleon targets are of vital importance to the neutrino oscillation experimental program. On the other hand, the necessary experimental data for neutrino scattering with elementary targets are scarce because of the weak interaction cross section, which leads to poorly-constrained nucleon and nuclear cross sections. Lattice QCD is uniquely positioned to provide the requisite nucleon amplitudes needed to enable high-precision oscillation experiments. In particular, LQCD has the ability to probe axial matrix elements that are challenging to isolate or completely inaccessible to experiments. In these proceedings, I will discuss some of my work to quantify neutrino cross sections with realistic uncertainty estimates, primarily focusing on neutrino quasielastic scattering and the nucleon axial form factor. I will also outline how the needs of next-generation neutrino oscillation experimental programs can be met with modern dedicated LQCD computations.",

      "summary": "We calculate the nucleon electric dipole moment (EDM) from the $θ$ term with overlap fermions on three domain wall lattices with different sea pion masses at lattice spacing 0.11 fm. Due to the chiral symmetry conserved by the overlap fermions, we have well defined topological charge and chiral limit for the EDM. Thus, the chiral extrapolation can be carried out reliably at nonzero lattice spacings. We use three to four different partially quenched valence pion masses for each sea pion mass and find that the EDM dependence on the valence and sea pion masses behaves oppositely, which can be described by partially quenched chiral perturbation theory. With the help of the cluster decomposition error reduction (CDER) technique, we determine the neutron and proton EDM at the physical pion mass to be $d_{n}=-0.00148\\left(14\\right)\\left(31\\right)\\barθ$ e$\\cdot$fm and $d_{p}=0.0038\\left(11\\right)\\left(8\\right)\\barθ$ e$\\cdot$fm. This work is a clear demonstration of the advantages of using chiral fermions in the nucleon EDM calculation and paves the road to future precise studies of the strong $CP$ violation effects.",

The singularity structure of QCD in the complex $μ_B$ plane is probed using conserved charges calculated at imaginary $μ_B$. The location of the singularities is determined by studying the (uncancelled) poles of multi-point Padé approximants. We show that close to the Roberge-Weiss (RW) transition, the location of the LYE singularities scales according to the $3$-$d$ $Z(2)$ universality class. By combining the new $N_τ= 6$ data with the $N_τ= 4$ data from our previous analysis we extract a rough estimate for the RW temperature in the continuum limit. We also discuss some preliminary results for the singularities close to the chiral phase transition obtained from simulations on $N_τ= 6, 8$ lattices.",

In these proceedings, we lay the foundation for lattice QCD calculations of GPDs in \"asymmetric\" frames, where the transferred momentum is not symmetrically distributed between the incoming/outgoing hadrons. The novelty of our work relies on the parameterization of the matrix elements in terms of Lorentz-invariant amplitudes, which not only helps in establishing relations between the said frames but also helps in isolating higher-twist contaminations. As an example, we focus on the unpolarized GPDs for spin-1/2 particles.",
