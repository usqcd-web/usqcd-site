      "summary": "We explore the phase diagram of a lattice fermion model that exhibits three distinct phases: a massless fermion (MF) phase; a massive fermion phase with spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) induced by a fermion bilinear condensate; and a massive fermion phase with symmetric mass generation (SMG). Using the fermion-bag Monte Carlo method on large cubical lattices, we find evidence for traditional second-order critical points separating the first two and the latter two phases. Remarkably, these critical points appear to merge at a multicritical point with enhanced symmetry when the symmetry breaking parameter is tuned to zero, giving rise to the recently discovered direct second-order transition between the massless and symmetric massive fermion phases.",

      "summary": "We describe in detail the implementation of the relativistic three-neutron finite-volume quantization condition derived in Ref. [1]. In particular, we show how the complications due to Wigner rotations acting on spins are included, and present concrete formulas for the case when the angular momenta within pairs is restricted to be less than 2. We describe the symmetries of the matrices appearing in the quantization condition, and decompose solutions into irreducible representations of the appropriate doubled finite-volume symmetry groups. We present an implementation of the three-particle K matrix, keeping the two lowest-order terms in the threshold expansion. We provide numerical predictions for the finite-volume spectrum for a setup with nearly physical parameters, including two-particle interactions that are based on experimental results. This exploratory study shows the how lattice QCD calculations of the three-neutron spectrum with sufficient precision can provide detailed information on both two- and three-particle interactions.",

      "summary": "We report a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation of the total gluon helicity contribution to the proton spin, $ΔG$. The calculation is done on ensembles with three different lattice spacings $a=\\{0.08, 0.09, 0.11\\}$ fm. By employing distillation and momentum smearing for proton external states, we extract the bare matrix elements of the topological current $K^μ$ using 5-HYP smeared Coulomb gauge fixing configurations. Furthermore, we apply a non-perturbative $\\mathrm{RI/MOM}$ renormalization scheme augmented by the Cluster Decomposition Error Reduction (CDER) technique to determine the renormalization constants of $K^μ$. The results obtained from different components $K^{t,i}$ (with $i$ being the direction of proton momentum or polarization) are consistent with Lorentz covariance within uncertainties. After extrapolating to the continuum limit, $ΔG$ is found to be $ΔG = 0.231(17)^{\\mathrm{sta.}}(44)^{\\mathrm{sym.}}$ at the $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ scale $μ^2=10\\ \\mathrm{GeV}^2$, which constitutes approximately $46(9)\\%$ of the proton spin.",

      "summary": "We study the quantum Ising model on (2+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter space using Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPOs). Our spatial lattices correspond to regular tessellations of hyperbolic space with coordination number seven. We find the ground state of this model using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm which allowed us to probe lattices that range in size up to 232 sites. We explore the bulk phase diagram of the theory and find disordered and ordered phases separated by a phase transition. We find that the boundary-boundary spin correlation function exhibits power law scaling deep in the disordered phase of the Ising model consistent with the anti-de Sitter background. By tracing out the bulk indices, we are able to compute the density matrix for the boundary theory. At the critical point, we find the entanglement entropy exhibits the logarithmic dependence of boundary length expected for a one-dimensional CFT but away from this, we see a linear scaling. In comparison, the full system exhibits a volume law scaling, which is expected in chaotic and highly connected systems. We also measure Out-of-time-Ordered-Correlators (OTOCs) to explore the scrambling behavior of the theory.",

      "title": "Three-dimensional imaging of hadrons with hard exclusive reactions: advances in experiment, theory, phenomenology, and lattice QCD",
      "summary": "Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) have emerged as a powerful framework for exploring the internal structure of hadrons in terms of their partonic constituents. Over the past three decades, the field has witnessed significant theoretical and experimental advancements. The interpretation of GPDs in impact parameter space offers a vivid three-dimensional visualization of hadron structure, correlating longitudinal momentum and transverse spatial distributions, thereby enabling tomographic imaging of hadrons. Furthermore, the link between GPDs and the matrix elements of the QCD energy-momentum tensor provides access to fundamental properties of hadrons, including spin decomposition and internal pressure distributions. Notably, recent analyses of Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) data have enabled the empirical extraction of the quark pressure profile inside the proton. This white paper presents an overview of recent developments in GPD theory and phenomenology, as well as progress in lattice QCD studies. It outlines the prospects for advancing our understanding of hadron structure through the next generation of dedicated experiments, including the extension of the Jefferson Lab 12~GeV program (and its potential 22~GeV upgrade), J-PARC, COMPASS/AMBER, LHC ultra-peripheral collisions, and the future electron-ion colliders EIC and EicC.",

Here we demonstrate that we can access finite density QCD in the canonical formulation with physical quark masses. We present first results with both the strangeness ($n_S$) and baryon ($n_B$) densities as parameters.

      "summary": "In this work, we present a first-principles lattice-QCD calculation of the unpolarized quark PDF for the pion and the kaon. The lattice data rely on matrix elements calculated for boosted mesons coupled to non-local operators containing a Wilson line. The calculations on this lattice ensemble correspond to two degenerate light, a strange, and a charm quark ($N_f=2+1+1$), using maximally twisted mass fermions with a clover term. The lattice volume is $32^3\\times 64$, with a lattice spacing of 0.0934 fm, and a pion mass of 260 MeV. Matrix elements are calculated for hadron boosts of $|P_3| = 0,~0.41,~0.83,~1.25,~1.66,$ and 2.07 GeV. To match lattice QCD results to their light-cone counterparts, we employ two complementary frameworks: the large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) and the short-distance factorization (SDF). Using these approaches in parallel, we also test the lattice data to identify methodology-driven systematics. Results are presented for the standard quark PDFs, as well as the valence sector. Beyond obtaining the PDFs, we also explore the possibility of extracting information on SU(3) flavor-symmetry-breaking effects. For LaMET, we also parametrize the momentum dependence to obtain the infinite-momentum PDFs.",

      "summary": "Large superconducting quantum circuits have a number of important applications in quantum computing. Accurately predicting the performance of these devices from first principles is challenging, as it requires solving the many-body Schrödinger equation. This work introduces a new, general ab-initio method for analyzing large quantum circuits based on lattice field theory, a tool commonly applied in nuclear and particle physics. This method is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques such as tensor networks, but avoids introducing systematic errors due to truncation of the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space associated with superconducting phases. The approach is applied to fluxonium, a specific many-component superconducting qubit with favorable qualities for quantum computation. A systematic study of the influence of impedance on fluxonium is conducted that parallels previous experimental studies, and ground capacitance effects are explored. The qubit frequency and charge noise dephasing rate are extracted from statistical analyses of charge noise, where thousands of instantiations of charge disorder in the Josephson junction array of a fixed fluxonium qubit are explicitly averaged over at the microscopic level. This is difficult to achieve with any other existing method.",

      "title": "A Framework for Quantum Simulations of Energy-Loss and Hadronization in Non-Abelian Gauge Theories: SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory in 1+1D",
      "summary": "Simulations of energy loss and hadronization are essential for understanding a range of phenomena in non-equilibrium strongly-interacting matter. We establish a framework for performing such simulations on a quantum computer and apply it to a heavy quark moving across a modest-sized 1+1D SU(2) lattice of light quarks. Conceptual advances with regard to simulations of non-Abelian versus Abelian theories are developed, allowing for the evolution of the energy in light quarks, of their local non-Abelian charge densities, and of their multi-partite entanglement to be computed. The non-trivial action of non-Abelian charge operators on arbitrary states suggests mapping the heavy quarks to qubits alongside the light quarks, and limits the heavy-quark motion to discrete steps among spatial lattice sites. Further, the color entanglement among the heavy quarks and light quarks is implemented using hadronic operators, and Domain Decomposition is shown to be effective in quantum state preparation. Scalable quantum circuits that account for the heterogeneity of non-Abelian charge sectors across the lattice are used to prepare the interacting ground-state wavefunction in the presence of heavy quarks. The discrete motion of heavy quarks between adjacent spatial sites is implemented using fermionic SWAP operations. Quantum simulations of the dynamics of a system on $L=3$ spatial sites are performed using IBM's ${\\tt ibm\\_pittsburgh}$ quantum computer using 18 qubits, for which the circuits for state preparation, motion, and one second-order Trotter step of time evolution have a two-qubit depth of 398. A suite of error mitigation techniques are used to extract the observables from the simulations, providing results that are in good agreement with classical simulations. The framework presented here generalizes straightforwardly to other non-Abelian groups, including SU(3) for quantum chromodynamics.",

      "summary": "We present lattice QCD results for ratios of net-baryon number cumulants along the pseudo-critical line and compare them with STAR measurements from the RHIC BES-II program. The ratio of first and second order cumulants, $R_{12}^B$, agrees well with corresponding net-proton number cumulants down to $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=11.5$ GeV or baryon chemical potentials $μ_B/T \\le 2$. Likewise higher-order cumulant ratios, $R_{31}^B$ and $R_{42}^B$, show no sign for the existence of a critical point in the parameter range explored with these cumulant ratios. A QCD critical point is unlikely to occur within the BES-II range in collider mode. Moreover, the results demonstrate that a non-interacting HRG description breaks down for $μ_B/T > 1$. We further analyze baryon-strangeness correlations normalized by strangeness fluctuations, finding consistency with STAR data at large beam energies but deviations at lower energies. Comparisons of electric-charge and strangeness correlations with STAR and ALICE data also show agreement at high energies, while the deviations at lower energies emphasize the role of unobserved strange resonances and the need for controlled feed-down corrections in baryon-strangeness correlations.",

To deal with the suppression of the false vacuum state in the Euclidean path integral, we develop a new sampling method which combines results from multiple Monte Carlo simulations.

The necessary condition for such a phase, referred to as Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG), is the cancellation of all (continuous and discrete) 't~Hooft anomalies. In 3+1 dimensions this occurs in systems containing a multiple of 16 massless Weyl fermions. SMG was originally discovered in lower dimensional condensed matter systems. We present results investigating four dimensional field theories with gauge group SU(3). Our findings suggest that SU(3) with $N_f=8$ fundamental fermions exhibits an SMG phase not only on the lattice but also in the infinite cutoff continuum limit. If confirmed, SMG could provide a new UV completion of the standard model and give rise to new scenarios for beyond standard model physics.",

      "summary": "The Collins-Soper (CS) kernel governs the rapidity evolution of transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) parton distributions, a cornerstone for QCD factorization and linking nucleon structure data across scales. Its nonperturbative behavior at large transverse separations ($b_{\\perp}$) remains weakly constrained due to phenomenological model dependencies. We present a first-principles determination of the CS kernel at the continuum limit and physical pion mass from lattice QCD in the large-momentum effective theory framework. Using (2+1)-flavor configurations (lattice spacings $a =(0.052-0.105$) fm, and pion mass $m_π \\approx (136, 230, 300, 320)$ MeV), we simulating the nonlocal equal-time correlation function and extract the quasi-TMD wave functions. Taking into account systematic improvements including hypercubic smearing, nonperturbative renormalization, and a $b_{\\perp}$-unexpanded matching kernel, we obtain the CS kernel at the continuum, chiral, and infinite-momentum limits. Our results are determined up to $b_{\\perp} \\sim 1$ fm, with controllable uncertainties, and agree with perturbative QCD at small $b_{\\perp}$ and global TMD phenomenological extractions. We conduct a global analysis integrated with phenomenological fits and demonstrate the impact of our results on such fits. This work yields the most precise nonperturbative constraint on the CS kernel's long-distance behavior from Lattice QCD, which not only bridges Lattice QCD, perturbation theory, and nucleon structure experiments for TMD studies, but also boosts the utility of our constraint for future global TMD analyses.",

      "summary": "Quantum Monte Carlo methods are powerful tools for studying quantum many-body systems but face difficulties in accessing excited states and in treating sign problems. We present a continuous-time path-integral Monte Carlo method for computing the low-lying spectrum of generic quantum Hamiltonians within a projection subspace. The method projects the thermal density matrix onto a subspace spanned by a chosen set of linearly independent states. It is free of Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states which have finite overlap with the projection subspace as the $β$ parameter increases. While most effective for systems without a sign problem, the method also yields information about low-energy spectra when sign problems are present. We illustrate the approach on two problems. For the sign-free case, we compute the first four low-energy levels in the scaling limit of the one-dimensional Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, demonstrating the flow from the conformal limit to the massive $E_8$ quantum field theory. For the sign-problem case, we apply the method to the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model and benchmark it against exact diagonalization on small lattices. We also present results for larger systems beyond the lattice sizes accessible to exact diagonalization, while limited to small $β$ where sign problems occur. Our method provides a general route toward quantum Monte Carlo spectroscopy for lattice Hamiltonians.",

      "summary": "Quantum data learning (QDL) provides a framework for extracting physical insights directly from quantum states, bypassing the need for any identification of the classical observable of the theory. A central challenge in many-body physics is that the identity of quantum phases, especially those with topological order, are often inaccessible through local observables or simple symmetry-breaking diagnostics. Here, we apply QDL techniques to the 2+1-dimensional toric-code loop-gas model in a magnetic field. Ground states are generated across multiple lattice sizes using a parametrized loop-gas circuit (PLGC) with a variational quantum-eigensolver (VQE) approach. We then train a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) across the full field-parameter range to perform phase classification and capture the overall phase structure. We also employ a physics-aware training protocol that excludes the near-critical region (0.2 <= x <= 0.4)) around (x_c = 0.25), the phase-transition point estimated by quantum Monte Carlo, reserving this window for testing to evaluate the ability of the model to learn the phase transition. In parallel, we implement an unsupervised quantum k-means method based on state overlaps, which partitions the dataset into two phases without prior labeling. Our supervised QDL approach recovers the phase structure and accurately locates the phase transition, in close agreement with previously reported values; the unsupervised QDL approach recovers the phase structure and locates the phase transition with a small offset as expected in finite volumes; both QDL methods outperform classical alternatives. These findings establish QDL as an effective framework for characterizing topological quantum matter, studying finite volume effects, and probing phase diagrams of higher-dimensional systems.",

      "summary": "We present a systematic study of the nucleon gluon parton distribution function (PDF) using the self-renormalized large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) approach in lattice QCD. This work extends previous gluon-PDF extractions by performing a detailed analysis of key systematic effects, including gauge-link smearing, lattice spacing, pion mass, and nucleon boost momentum. The self-renormalization framework mitigates ultraviolet divergences associated with Wilson-line self-energy and renormalon contributions by combining lattice matrix elements with perturbative short-distance information, thereby preserving the correct infrared structure. Calculations are performed on $N_f=2+1+1$ HISQ ensembles generated by the MILC Collaboration at three lattice spacings and two pion masses, with boosted nucleon states reaching momenta up to 2.2~GeV. We determine renormalization factors from zero-momentum matrix elements and apply hybrid renormalization to suppress discretization artifacts. After extrapolating large-separation behavior and performing Fourier transforms, we reconstruct quasi-PDFs and match them to lightcone PDFs using next-to-leading order Wilson coefficients. Our results demonstrate that smearing and lattice-spacing effects are under control, and pion-mass and lattice-spacing dependence is mild relative to the current $O(10^6)$ statistics; however, momentum dependence remains a significant source of uncertainty. Future work including even larger boost momenta will be essential to reduce systematics in lattice determinations of the gluon PDF and to advance toward precision QCD phenomenology at the LHC and the future Electron-Ion Collider.",

      "summary": "Critical slowing down, where autocorrelation grows rapidly near the continuum limit due to Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) moving through configuration space inefficiently, still challenges lattice gauge theory simulations. Combining neural field transformations with HMC (NTHMC) can reshape the energy landscape and accelerate sampling, but the choice of neural architectures has yet to be studied systematically. We evaluate NTHMC on a two-dimensional U(1) gauge theory, analyzing how it scales and transfers to larger volumes and smaller lattice spacing. Controlled comparisons let us isolate architectural contributions to sampling efficiency. Good designs can reduce autocorrelation and boost topological tunneling while maintaining favorable scaling. More broadly, our study highlights emerging design guides, such as wider receptive fields and channel-dependent activations, paving the way for systematic extensions to four-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory.",

We adopt the infinite volume reconstruction (IVR) method, which extends lattice data to infinite volume and effectively controls the finite volume effects. This study represents a first step toward a complete calculation of radiative corrections to leptonic decays using the IVR method, including both real photon emissions and virtual photon loops. For decays involving a final state electron, collinear radiative corrections, enhanced by the large logarithmic factors such as $\\ln(m_π^2/m_e^2)$ and $\\ln(m_K^2/m_e^2)$, can reach the level of $O(10\\%)$ and are essential at the current level of theoretical and experimental precision. After including these corrections, our result for $π\\to eν_eγ$ agrees with the PIBETA measurement; for \\(K \\to eν_eγ\\), our results are consistent with the KLOE data and exhibit a $1.7σ$ tension with E36; and for $K \\to μν_μγ$, where radiative corrections are negligible, our results confirm the previously observed discrepancies between lattice results and the ISTRA/OKA measurements at large photon energies, and with the E787 results at large muon photon angles.",

As a testing ground, we employ SU($3$) isosymmetric gauge configurations generated by the OpenLat initiative with a pseudoscalar mass of $m_π\\simeq 411~\\text{MeV}$. Our analysis uses four lattice spacings and a nonperturbatively improved action, enabling full control over the continuum extrapolation, and the limit of vanishing flow time, $t\\to0$. The flowed ratios exhibit O($a^2$) scaling across the ensembles, and the continuum-extrapolated results, matched to the $\\overline {\\text{MS}}$ scheme at $μ= 2$ GeV using next-to-next-to-leading order matching coefficients, show only mild residual flow-time dependence. The resulting ratios, computed with a relatively small number of configurations, are consistent with phenomenological expectations for the pion's valence distribution, with statistical uncertainties that are competitive with modern global fits. These findings demonstrate that the gradient flow provides an efficient and systematically improvable method to access partonic quantities from first principles. Future extensions of this work will target lighter pion masses toward the physical point, and applications to nucleon structure such as the proton PDFs and the gluon and sea-quark distributions.",

      "title": "Finite density QCD phase structure from strangeness fluctuations",
      "summary": "Charting the phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at large density is a challenging task due to the complex action problem in lattice simulations. Through simulations at imaginary baryon chemical potential $μ_B$ we observe that, if the strangeness neutrality condition is imposed, both the strangeness chemical potential $μ_S/μ_B$ and the strangeness susceptibility $χ_2^S$ take on constant values at the chiral transition for varying $μ_B$. We present new lattice data to extrapolate contours of constant $μ_S/μ_B$ or $χ_2^S$ to finite baryon chemical potential. We argue that they are good proxies for the QCD crossover because, as we show, they are only mildly influenced by criticality and by finite volume effects. We obtain continuum limits for these proxies up to $μ_B = 400$ MeV, through a next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO) Taylor expansion based on large-statistics data on $16^3 \\times 8$, $20^3 \\times 10$ and $24^3 \\times 12$ lattices with our 4HEX improved staggered action. We show that these are in excellent agreement with existing results for the chiral transition and, strikingly, also with analogous contours obtained with the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model. On the $16^3 \\times 8$ lattice, we carry out the expansion up to next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^4$LO), and extend the extrapolation beyond $μ_B=500$ MeV, again finding perfect agreement with the HRG model. This suggests that the crossover line constructed from this proxy starts deviating from the chemical freeze-out line near $μ_B\\approx500$ MeV, as expected but not yet observed.",

Nonetheless, preparing non-trivial initial states remains a major obstacle. Euclidean-time Monte-Carlo methods yield ground-state spectra and static correlation functions that can, in principle, guide state preparation. In this work, we exploit this classical information to bridge Euclidean and Minkowski descriptions for a (1+1)-dimensional interacting scalar field theory. We propose variational ansatz families which achieve comparable ground-state energies, yet exhibit distinct correlations and local non-Gaussianity. By optimizing selected wavefunction moments with Monte-Carlo data, we obtain ansatzes that can be efficiently translated into quantum circuits. Our algorithmic cost analysis shows these circuits' gate complexity scales polynomially in system size. Our work paves the way for systematically leveraging classically-computed information to prepare initial states in quantum field theories of interest in nature.",

By formulating quantum chromodynamics on a space-time lattice in imaginary time, such integrations can be carried out non-perturbatively using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo method with importance sampling. The energies of stationary states in the finite volume of the lattice can be extracted from the temporal correlations. A quantization condition involving the scattering $K$-matrix and a complicated ``box matrix'' also yields a finite-volume energy spectrum. By appropriately parametrizing the scattering $K$-matrix, the best-fit values of the $K$-matrix parameters are those that produce a finite-volume spectrum which most closely matches that obtained from the Monte Carlo computations. Results for the $Δ$ resonance are presented, and a study of scattering for energies near the $Λ(1405)$ resonance is outlined, showing a two pole structure. The prospects for applying this methodology to the Roper resonance are discussed.",

High statistics calculations with boost momentum $P_z \\approx 2.0$-$2.2$~GeV are performed at lattice spacings of $a \\approx \\{ 0.15, 0.12, 0.09 \\}$~fm, a pion mass of $M_π\\approx 310$~MeV, with $N_f=2+1+1$ quark flavors. We apply gradient flow smearing with $\\mathcal{T}_\\text{W} = 3a^2$, finding that self-renormalization remains stable. The renormalized gluon matrix elements and PDFs show consistent behavior across lattice spacings, with the $a \\approx 0.09$~fm results statistically compatible with the continuum limit. Our final LaMET gluon PDF compares reasonably with select global-fit determinations, specifically preferring analyses which have near-zero gluonic density in the $x \\gtrsim 0.6$ region.",

With the overlap fermion, it is numerically verified that the important symmetries of the theory can be realized on the lattice. The analytic correlators are derived and compared to the lattice results, which agree including the overall normalization. The $O(a^2)$-scaling is confirmed toward the analytic value in the continuum limit, and the number of reproduced excited states is estimated heuristically for the first few refinement levels. Our study helps us identify the features of the theory that we can study on the icosahedral lattice without fine-tuning.",

Using strong-coupling perturbation theory as a guide, we develop simple ansatz circuits for ground state preparation and test them via classical simulation on small lattices, including the $2\\times 2$ plaquette lattice in $d=2$ and the cube in $d=3$. We contrast state fidelities and resource requirements of variational methods against adiabatic state preparation and introduce a method that hybridizes the two approaches. Finally, we report on the public release of \\texttt{ymcirc} -- a package of tools for building $SU(3)$ circuits and processing measurements -- and \\texttt{pyclebsch}, a package for efficiently computing $SU(N)$ Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.",

      "summary": "We extend the relativistic field theoretic finite-volume formalism to $N ππ$ scattering states at maximal isospin, $I=5/2$. As in previous work using the relativistic field theory approach, we work to all orders in a generic low-energy effective theory, and determine the quantization condition that relates finite-volume energies to intermediate K matrices, and the integral equations connecting the latter to the physical scattering amplitudes. We discuss the parametrization of the K matrices, and explain in detail the new features that arise in implementing the quantization condition due to the spin of the nucleon in combination with the use of non-degenerate particles. As a concrete example, we provide a sample numerical application including the $Δ$ resonance in the $Nπ$ subchannel. The extension to the $I=3/2$ and $1/2$ channels is more involved, due to mixing with $Nπ$ states, and we do not provide a complete formalism for these cases. We explain why $Nπ$ states cannot be included by treating the nucleon as a pole in $p$-wave $Nπ$ scattering, an approach that has been successful in studying $D D^*$ scattering using the three-particle $DDπ$ formalism. We additionally provide results for all isospins under the assumption of no two-to-three mixing, thereby laying the groundwork for a follow-up paper in which all $Nππ\\leftrightarrow Nπ$ systems are fully treated. Finally, we study the singularities in $Nππ$ amplitudes arising from $Nπππ$ intermediate states, and find that our subthreshold cutoff functions must be modified to avoid such singularities.",

The fidelity of the $2T$-quoctit is benchmarked against other bosonic qudits for different noise models and find it compare favorably when power constraints are considered.

We present a unified neural-network approach that learns these distributions directly from matrix elements calculated via numerical simulations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) on the lattice by fitting two complementary inputs simultaneously: data matched to physical quantities via known momentum-space and coordinate-space formalisms. Utilizing data from both methods stabilizes the extraction and mitigates biases that can arise when either is used alone. We validate the method on controlled mock data and apply it to lattice-QCD matrix elements to extract parton distribution functions (PDFs). We show benefits of such an approach for determining the physical quantities. We further extend the framework to zero-skewness generalized parton distributions and demonstrate nucleon tomography within the same neural-network parameterization. Our results provide an adaptable and systematically improvable approach for extracting partonic distributions from Euclidean correlators. It can incorporate polarization, additional channels, and future experimental constraints from current and future facilities, such as the Electron-Ion Collider.",

      "summary": "Simulating out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum field theories in nature is challenging with classical methods, but is a promising application for quantum computers. Unfortunately, simulating interacting bosonic fields involves a high boson-to-qubit encoding overhead. Furthermore, when mapping to qubits, the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of bosons is necessarily truncated, with truncation errors that grow with energy and time. A qubit-based quantum computer, augmented with an active bosonic register, and with qubit, bosonic, and mixed qubit-boson quantum gates, offers a more powerful platform for simulating bosonic theories. We demonstrate this capability experimentally in a hybrid analog-digital trapped-ion quantum computer, where qubits are encoded in the internal states of the ions, and the bosons in the ions' motional states. Specifically, we simulate nonequilibrium dynamics of a (1+1)-dimensional Yukawa model, a simplified model of interacting nucleons and pions, and measure fermion- and boson-occupation-state probabilities. These dynamics populate high bosonic-field excitations starting from an empty state, and the experimental results capture well such high-occupation states. This simulation approaches the regime where classical methods become challenging, bypasses the need for a large qubit overhead, and removes truncation errors. Our results, therefore, open the way to achieving demonstrable quantum advantage in qubit-boson quantum computing.",

Solving the Hermitian positive definite systems, which are sparse but ill-conditioned, involves using iterative methods, such as Conjugate Gradient (CG), which are time-consuming and computationally expensive. Preconditioners can effectively accelerate this process, with the state-of-the-art being multigrid preconditioners. However, constructing useful preconditioners can be challenging, adding additional computational overhead, especially in large linear systems. We propose a framework, leveraging operator learning techniques, to construct linear maps as effective preconditioners. The method in this work does not rely on explicit matrices from either the original linear systems or the produced preconditioners, allowing efficient model training and application in the CG solver. In the context of the Schwinger model U(1) gauge theory in 1+1 spacetime dimensions with two degenerate-mass fermions), this preconditioning scheme effectively decreases the condition number of the linear systems and approximately halves the number of iterations required for convergence in relevant parameter ranges. We further demonstrate the framework learns a general mapping dependent on the lattice structure which leads to zero-shot learning ability for the Dirac operators constructed from gauge field configurations of different sizes.",

      "summary": "We show how to construct Hamiltonian lattice theories with one exact supersymmetry on arbitrary triangulations of curved space in any number of dimensions. Both bosons and fermions satisfy discrete Kähler-Dirac equations. The quantization of the fermions proceeds by imposing conventional anti-commutation relations while the bosons require a modification of the usual canonical commutator. On regular lattices we construct parity, time reversal and translation-by-one (shift) symmetries. We argue that the latter are generically non-invertible symmetries. We also show how to couple these degrees of freedom to background gauge fields which leads to a theory with enhanced supersymmetry.",

Using a conformal moment space parametrization, we achieve a unified description across low- and high-$x$ regions at next to leading order (NLO) accuracy in perturbative corrections. The results provide state-of-the-art GPDs consistent with almost all known facts, enabling three-dimensional nucleon imaging in impact parameter space and, at the same time, establishing a benchmark for future theoretical and experimental studies of the nucleon structure.",

These simulators, primarily based on neutral atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting circuits, hold the potential to address long-standing questions in nuclear, high-energy, and condensed-matter physics, and may ultimately allow first-principles studies of matter evolution in settings ranging from the early universe to high-energy collisions. Research in this rapidly growing field is also driving the convergence of concepts across disciplines and uncovering new phenomena. In this Review, we highlight recent experimental and theoretical developments, focusing on phenomena accessible in current and near-term quantum simulators, including particle production and string breaking, collision dynamics, thermalization, ergodicity breaking, and dynamical quantum phase transitions. We conclude by outlining promising directions for future research and opportunities enabled by available quantum hardware.",

It is known that $\\langle \\barψ ψ\\rangle$ can be usefully scale-decomposed via spectral density $ρ(λ)$ of Dirac modes. Here I give such formula for $\\langle F^2 \\rangle$, which reveals that gluon condensate is a strictly UV quantity. For the recently-found IR phase [1,2], where the infrared (IR) degrees of freedom separate out and become independent of the system's bulk, it implies that $\\langle F^2 \\rangle$ due to this IR part vanishes. Its glue thus doesn't contribute to scale anomaly of the entire system and is, in this sense, scale invariant consistently with the original claim. Associated formulas are used to define IR decoupling of glue, which may serve as an alternative indicator of IR phase transition. Using the simplest form of coherent lattice QCD, we express the effective action of full QCD entirely via Dirac spectral density.",

      "summary": "Large Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET) provides a general framework for computing the multi-dimensional partonic structure of the proton from first principles using lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In this effective field theory approach, LaMET predicts parton distributions through a power expansion and perturbative matching of a class of Euclidean observables -- quasi-distributions -- evaluated at large proton momenta. Recent advances in lattice renormalization, such as the hybrid scheme with leading-renormalon resummation, together with improved matching kernel that incorporates higher-loop corrections and resummations, have enhanced both the perturbative and power accuracy of LaMET, enabling a reliable quantification of theoretical uncertainties. Moreover, the Coulomb-gauge correlator approach further simplifies lattice analyses and improves the precision of transverse-momentum-dependent structures, particularly in the non-perturbative region. State-of-the-art LaMET calculations have already yielded certain parton observables with significant phenomenological impact. In addition, the recently proposed kinematically enhanced lattice interpolation operators promise access to unprecedented proton momenta with greatly improved signal-to-noise ratios, which will extend the range of LaMET prediction and further suppress the power corrections. The remaining challenges, such as controlling excited-state contamination in lattice matrix elements and extracting gluonic distributions, are expected to benefit from emerging lattice techniques for ground-state isolation and noise reduction. Thus, lattice QCD studies of parton physics have entered an exciting stage of precision control and systematic improvement, which will have a broader impact for nuclear and particle experiments.",

In particular, the empirical distributions of importance-sampling Monte-Carlo samples of these correlation functions are examined as a function of the spacetime separation between the two points and the baryon number. While the exact forms of these distributions are not known for QCD, recent work has determined asymptotic expressions for analogous correlation function distributions in simpler theories such as scalar field theory and the disordered phase of the $O(N)$ model. The theoretical O(N) model distributions are found to provide an accurate description of the empirical QCD distributions at zero momentum over a wide range of temporal separations for each baryon number when assessed with a range of different statistical tests. In particular, the behaviour of the baryon number $B$ QCD correlation function at large temporal separation is well-reproduced by the $O(N \\sim 2/B)$ model distribution.",

      "summary": "The primary goal of this project is the reconstruction of quarkonium spectral functions from thermal lattice correlators, relevant for the study of Quark-Gluon Plasma in heavy-ion collisions. To this end, we pursue the generation of fully dynamical anisotropic HISQ (aHISQ) ensembles, aiming at a physical strange quark and a heavier-than-physical light quark mass, corresponding to a 300 MeV continuum pion mass. We report on tuning the gauge anisotropy and the lattice spacing of anisotropic pure gauge ensembles with the tree-level Symanzik-improved action using the gradient flow and compare various tuning schemes. We also discuss the simultaneous tuning of the strange quark mass and the quark anisotropy with aHISQ, using spectrum measurements on quenched ensembles. We compare different ways to tune the quark anisotropy and discuss pion taste splittings for aHISQ at anisotropies up to 8. Finally, we present the expressions for the aHISQ fermion force required for dynamical simulations.",

      "summary": "We extend the formalism of asymmetric frames of reference for generalized parton distributions (GPDs) to the case of nonzero skewness, i.e., including longitudinal momentum transfer. The framework, based on Lorentz-invariant amplitudes and previously developed and numerically implemented for unpolarized, helicity and transversity GPDs at zero skewness, gives efficient access to a broad range of kinematics, making full mapping of GPDs from the lattice realistic. The general-skewness formalism is tested using lattice data with both transverse and longitudinal or only longitudinal momentum transfer, the latter being a special case with a reduced number of independent amplitudes. We extract the amplitudes in coordinate space and express the GPDs $H$ and $E$ in terms of these amplitudes. This is followed by reconstruction of quasi-distributions and their matching to the light cone. We further identify and discuss the principal challenges for nonzero skewness GPDs.",

      "summary": "Momentum current density (MCD) $T^{ij}$ is a general physics concept describing the momentum conservation through momentum flow generated from both the kinetic motion of particles and the interacting forces among them. It has been suggested by M. Polyakov et al. that the MCD in the nucleon, characterized by the form factor $C/D$ of the QCD energy-momentum tensor, can be interpreted as the pressure and shear forces between adjacent parts of the system because the nucleon interior approximates a continuous medium. While intuitively appealing, we find that the interpretation is hard to justify from a detailed examination of the physical mechanisms for the momentum flow in QCD. After reviewing through a broad range of classical and quantum systems, we find that while thermal and/or quantum average of isotropic motion contributes to kinetic MCD a pressure term proportional to $δ^{ij}$, when there is an anisotropic motion, the pressure cannot simply be identified from the MCD tensor. Furthermore, kinetic pressure cannot be considered as the surface force between adjacent parts of a system. More importantly, at the scale of the nucleon dimension, the color forces among quarks and gluons is by no means short-ranged as in a continuous medium, and the resulting interaction MCD cannot be interpreted as normal or shear ``stress'' force, although an isotropic term from the QCD trace anomaly may be interpreted as a ``vacuum pressure.'' Following our previous study of force densities through divergences of kinetic MCDs, we affirm that the vacuum pressure term provides a confining potential on the quarks through color Lorentz forces.",

The aim is to explore and demonstrate the challenges in applying the formalism to more practical settings. Specifically, Monte Carlo simulations of a complex $φ^4$ relativistic field model are carried out in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions on lattices of varying sizes, and phaseshifts for the contact interaction are extracted from the formalism using modest computing resources.",

Using the generic-isospin extension of the RFT formalism and applying our open-source Python library to implement the framework, we predict a range of three-pion energies for illustrative values of the two-to-two scattering amplitudes for various finite-volume irreps also with non-zero total momentum $\\boldsymbol P$ in the finite-volume frame. The results restrict attention to the case of a vanishing intrinsic three-body interaction so that the spectra can be understood as a baseline. In future lattice QCD calculations, deviations from these values will be translated into evidence for intrinsic three-body effects in the various scattering channels.",

This result and constraints from Gauss's law are used to prove that weakly-coupled pNRQCD van der Waals potentials in generic non-Abelian gauge theories with only heavy quarks are too weak to form bound states whose color state is a product of color-singlets. Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of four, five, and six quarks with equal masses provide numerical evidence that exotic color configurations are higher energy than products of color-singlet hadrons, suggesting that equal-mass fully-heavy tetraquark, pentaquark, and hexaquark bound states do not exist at next-to-leading order in pNRQCD and at all orders in QCD-like theories in which all quark masses are asymptotically large. Mechanisms for generating hadron-hadron bound states are identified, which necessarily involve large quark-mass hierarchies, relativistic effects arising from the presence of sufficiently light quarks, or nonperturbative effects outside the scope of weakly-coupled pNRQCD.",

      "summary": "Lightcone distribution amplitudes for a light baryon can be extracted through the simulation of the quasi-distribution amplitudes (quasi-DAs) on the lattice. We implement the hybrid renormalization for the quasi DAs of light baryons. Lattice simulations are performed using $N_f = 2+1$ stout-smeared clover fermions and a tree-level Symanzik-improved gauge action, with three lattice spacings of ${0.105, 0.077, 0.052}$ fm. By analyzing zero-momentum matrix elements for different lattice spacings, we extract the linear divergence associated with the Wilson-line self-energy. Matching to perturbative matrix elements in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme yields the residual self-renormalization factors. Using these factors, we renormalize the quasi-DAs within the hybrid scheme, which combines self-renormalization at large separations and the ratio scheme at short distances. The renormalized results demonstrate effective cancellation of linear divergences and yield smooth, continuum-like coordinate-space distributions suitable for subsequent Fourier transformation and perturbative matching. These results establish the viability of both self and hybrid renormalization frameworks for light baryon quasi-DAs, providing a robust foundation for LaMET-based determinations of light-cone distribution amplitudes.",

      "summary": "Massless overlap fermions in the real representation of two dimensional $SU(N_c)$ gauge theories exhibit a mod($2$) index due to the rigidity of its spectrum when viewed as a function of the background gauge field - lattice gauge fields on a periodic torus come under two classes; ones that have one set of chirally paired zero modes and ones that do not. Focusing on $SU(2)$ and a single Majorana fermion in an integer representation, $J$; we present numerical evidence that shows only one of these classes survives the continuum limit and this depends on the boundary conditions of the fermion and the gauge field. As such, two of the four possible partition functions are zero in the continuum limit. By defining modified partition functions which do not include the zero modes of the overlap fermions in the fermion determinant, we are able to define an expectation value for a fermion bilinear as ratios of two mixed partition functions. This observable is referred to as the topological condensate and has a non-zero expectation value on any finite physical torus and also has a non-zero limit as the size of the torus is taken to infinity. We study the spectral density of fermions and the scaling of the lowest eigenvalue with the size of the torus to show the absence of any spontaneous symmetry breaking but the emergence of zero modes in the infinite volume limit where it is prohibited in finite volume. These results remain the same for $J = 1, 2, 3, 4$. These results motivate us to propose an independent plaquette model which reproduces the correct physics in the infinite volume limit using a single partition function.",

The analysis focuses on systematically obtaining these eigenvalues to understand better the behavior of the pion under different kinematic conditions. Once extracted, these energy eigenvalues obtained through plateau fitting of the Energy vs Time graph, are utilized to plot the dispersion relation of the pion. This resulting dispersion relation is then compared with theoretical predictions to assess the accuracy and validity of the computational approach.

These results are corrected for QED by including (quenched) QED in the simulations. They are among the most accurate values by any method to date. We give a detailed analysis of finite lattice-spacing errors that shows why the HISQ discretization of the quark action is particularly useful for $b$-quark simulations even for lattices where $am_b\\approx1$.

      "summary": "Neutrinoless double-beta ($0νββ$) decays provide an excellent probe for determining whether neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana fermions. The short-range matrix elements associated with the $π^- \\to π^+ ee$ process contribute at leading order in the $0νββ$ decay channel $nn \\to ppee$ through pion exchange between nucleons. However, current lattice calculations show notable discrepancies in predicting these short-range contributions. To address this issue, we perform a lattice QCD calculation of the $π^- \\to π^+ ee$ matrix elements using domain wall fermion ensembles at the physical pion mass generated by the RBC and UKQCD Collaborations. To mitigate contamination from around-the-world effects, we develop a new method to reconstruct and subtract them directly from lattice data. We then perform a nonperturbative renormalization using the RI/SMOM scheme. Compared with previous studies, this work reduces the uncertainties in the matrix elements and provides an independent cross-check that helps to reconcile the discrepancies among previous lattice calculations.",

      "summary": "Numerical analytic continuation arises frequently in lattice field theory, particularly in spectroscopy problems. This work shows the equivalence of common spectroscopic problems to certain classes of moment problems that have been studied thoroughly in the mathematical literature. Mathematical results due to Kovalishina enable rigorous bounds on smeared matrix-valued spectral functions, which are implemented numerically for the first time. The required input is a positive-definite matrix of Euclidean-time correlation functions; such matrices are routinely computed in variational spectrum studies using lattice quantum chromodynamics. This work connects the moment-problem perspective to recent developments using the Rayleigh--Ritz method and Lanczos algorithm. Possible limitations due to finite numerical precision are discussed.",

      "summary": "Pump-probe spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing response dynamics of quantum many-body systems in and out-of-equilibrium. Quantum computers have proved useful in simulating such experiments by exciting the system, evolving, and then measuring observables to first order, all in one setting. Here, we use this approach to investigate the mixed-field Ising model, where the longitudinal field plays the role of a confining potential that prohibits the spread of the excitations, spinons, or domain walls into space. We study the discrete bound states that arise from such a setting and their evolution under different quench dynamics by initially pumping the chain out of equilibrium and then probing various non-equal time correlation functions. Finally, we study false vacuum decay, where initially one expects unhindered propagation of the ground state, or true vacuum, bubbles into the lattice, but instead sees the emergence of Bloch oscillations that are directly the reason for the long-lived oscillations in this finite-size model. Our work sets the stage for simulating systems out-of-equilibrium on classical and quantum computers using pump-probe experiments without needing ancillary qubits.",

      "summary": "A hallmark of the computational campaign in nuclear and particle physics is the lattice-gauge-theory program. It continues to enable theoretical predictions for a range of phenomena in nature from the underlying Standard Model. The emergence of a new computational paradigm based on quantum computing, therefore, can introduce further advances in this program. In particular, it is believed that quantum computing will make possible first-principles studies of matter at extreme densities, and in and out of equilibrium, hence improving our theoretical description of early universe, astrophysical environments, and high-energy particle collisions. Developing and advancing a quantum-computing based lattice-gauge-theory program, therefore, is a vibrant and fast-moving area of research in theoretical nuclear and particle physics.\n  These lecture notes introduce the topic of quantum computing lattice gauge theories in a pedagogical manner, with an emphasis on theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the program, and on the most common approaches and practices, to keep the presentation focused and useful. Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theories is introduced within the Kogut-Susskind framework, the notion of Hilbert space and physical states is discussed, and some elementary numerical methods for performing Hamiltonian simulations are discussed. Quantum-simulation preliminaries and digital quantum-computing basics are presented, which set the stage for concrete examples of gauge-theory quantum-circuit design and resource analysis. A step-by-step analysis is provided for a simpler Abelian gauge theory, and an overview of our current understanding of the quantum-computing cost of quantum chromodynamics is presented in the end. Examples and exercises augment the material, and reinforce the concepts and methods introduced throughout.",

We demonstrate this with the quantum Ising model, lattice $λφ^4$ approximated with qutrits, and arrays of Rydberg atoms. To do so we make use of multipartite compositions of entanglement quantities for different parts combined to form the strong subadditivity, weak monotonicity, and a convex combination of these with conformal properties. These quantities display some remarkable properties. We will demonstrate how the entanglement of individual parts together displays behavior at phase boundaries, but the combination of these in the aforementioned quantities sharpens and localizes this behavior to the boundaries even better. We will show that we can extend a scheme for approximating the entanglement with the mutual information, and that this acts as a lower bound which will also follow the changes in the entanglement for the above quantities, despite the additional contributions of different signs. This mutual information approximation to the identifying quantities can have its lower probabilities removed in a process we call filtering, and despite the combination of terms will respond well to the filtering and offer improvements to the lower bound.",

We demonstrate that by using a few thousand shots from a single copy of the ladder simulator it is possible to estimate the bipartite quantum von Neumann entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. The estimation relies on an optimized filtration of the mutual information associated with the bitstrings obtained from public facilities of configurable Rydberg arrays named Aquila. We discuss the limitations associated with finite sampling, sorting fidelity, adiabatic preparation, ramp-down of the Rabi frequency before measurement, and readout errors. We use cumulative probability distribution to compare Aquila results with high accuracy density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) or exact results. The state preparation appears to be the main source of error. We discuss the large volume behavior of the cumulative probability distribution and show examples where for a finite number of shots, there appears to be some large enough size for which, with high probability, any given state is seen at most once. We show that the results presented can be extended to multipartite entanglement. We briefly discuss the cost of the calculations for large square arrays in the context of obtaining quantum advantage in the near future.",

However, these amplitudes are typically expressed in an asymmetric basis, where one of the initial and final state particles is singled out, and all quantum numbers are defined relative to this spectator. In this work, we show how to construct symmetric partial wave amplitudes, which have been symmetrized over all possible spectator combinations, using their asymmetric counterparts and sets of recoupling coefficients. We derive these recoupling coefficients for arbitrary angular momentum and isospin for arbitrary systems of spinless particles with SU(2) flavor symmetry. We propose a simple intensity observable suitable for visualizing the structure of three-body dynamics in Dalitz distributions. Finally, we provide some numerical examples of Dalitz distributions relevant for future lattice QCD calculations of $3π$ systems and provide numerical evidence that the symmetrization procedure is consistent with expected symmetries of Dalitz plots.",

      "summary": "We have performed high-statistics lattice simulations using 4HEX improved staggered fermions on $16^3 \\times 8$ lattices. We calculated the Taylor expansion coefficients of the pressure with respect to the baryochemical potential to the tenth order at zero, and fourth order at purely imaginary chemical potentials. We used this data to construct rational function approximations of the free energy. We use a rational ansatz that explicitly satisfies the charge conjugation symmetry and the Roberge-Weiss periodicity, which are exact properties of the QCD free energy. We use this ansatz to estimate the position of Lee-Yang zeros in the complex chemical potential plane. The temperature dependence of the imaginary part of the Lee-Yang zeros is then fitted with ansätze motivated by the universal behavior of the free energy near a 3D Ising critical point. In principle, this allows one to estimate the temperature of the critical endpoint. We consider several sources of systematic errors. On this single lattice spacing we find that with $84\\%$ probability, the chiral critical endpoint is either below $103$~MeV temperature or it does not exist. We also identify some caveats of the method, which do not disappear even with the extremely high statistics of this present study. We discuss to what extent these can be eliminated by future high statistics lattice analyses.",

      "summary": "In arXiv:2504.17706 {Dutrieux:2025jed} we criticized the excessive model-dependence introduced by rigid few-parameter fits to extrapolate lattice data in the large momentum effective theory (LaMET) when the data are noisy and lose signal before an exponential asymptotic behavior of the space-like correlators is established. In reaction, arXiv:2505.14619 {Chen:2025cxr} claims that even when the data is of poor quality, rigid parametrizations are better than attempts at representing the uncertainty using what they call \"inverse problem methods\". We clarify the fundamental differences in our perspectives regarding how to meaningfully handle noisy lattice matrix elements, especially when they exhibit a strong sensitivity to the choice of regularization in the inverse problem. We additionally correct misunderstandings of {Chen:2025cxr} on our message and methods.",

      "summary": "In a pure Gaussian tripartition, a range of entanglement between two parties ($AB$) can be purified through classical communication of Gaussian measurements performed within the third ($C$). To begin, this work introduces a direct method to calculate a hierarchic series of projective $C$ measurements for the removal of any $AB$ Gaussian noise, circumventing divergences in prior protocols. Next, a multimode conic framework is developed for pursuing the maximum (Gaussian entanglement of assistance, GEOA) or minimum (Gaussian entanglement of formation, GEOF) pure entanglement that may be revealed or required between $AB$. Within this framework, a geometric necessary and sufficient entanglement condition emerges as a doubly-enclosed conic volume, defining a novel distance metric for conic optimization. Extremizing this distance for spacelike vacuum entanglement in the massless and massive free scalar fields yields (1) the highest known lower bound to GEOA, the first that decays slower than the two-point correlation functions and (2) the lowest known upper bound to GEOF, the first that decays exponentially mirroring the mixed $AB$ negativity. Furthermore, combination of the above with a generalization of previous partially-transposed noise filtering techniques allows calculation of a single $C$ measurement that maximizes the purified $AB$ entanglement. Beyond expectation that these behaviors of spacelike GEOA and GEOF persist in interacting theories, the present measurement and optimization techniques are applicable to physical many-body Gaussian states beyond quantum fields.",

We present lattice QCD results for this isothermal compressibility, expressed in terms of fluctuations of conserved charges that are related to baryon ($B$), electric charge ($Q$) and strangeness ($S$) quantum numbers. This generalized isothermal compressibility is compared with hadron resonance gas model calculations as well as with heavy-ion collision data obtained at RHIC and the LHC. We find $κ_{T,σ_Q^2}=13.8(1.3)$~fm$^3$/GeV at $T_{pc,0}=156.5(1.5)$~MeV and $\\hatμ_B=0$. This finding is consistent with the rescaled result of the ALICE Collaboration, where we replaced the number of charged hadrons ($N_{\\rm ch}$) by the total number of hadrons ($N_{\\rm tot}$) at freeze-out. Normalizing this result with the QCD pressure ($P$) we find that the isothermal compressibility on the pseudo-critical line stays close to that of an {\\it ideal gas}, {\\it i.e.} $P κ_{T,σ_Q^2}\\simeq 1$.",

      "summary": "We propose a new and simple method for determining the renormalized quark masses from lattice simulations. Renormalized quark masses are an important input to many phenomenological applications, including searching/modeling physics beyond the Standard Model. The non-perturbative renormalization is performed using gradient flow combined with the short-flow-time expansion that is improved by renormalization-group (RG) running to match to the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$-scheme. RG running connects the lattice scale to higher energies thus improving the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$-scheme matching. Implementing the RG running perturbatively, we demonstrate this method works reliably at least up to the charm-quark mass and is not exhibiting any signs of the usual ``window problem''. Using \\abbrev{RBC/UKQCD}'s (2+1)-flavor Shamir domain-wall fermion ensembles with Iwasaki gauge action, we find $m_s^\\overline{\\text{MS}}(μ=2 \\text{ GeV}) = 90(3)$ MeV and $m_c^\\overline{\\text{MS}}(μ=3 \\text{ GeV}) = 975(10)$ MeV. These results predict the scale-independent ratio $m_c/m_s= 12.0(4)$. Generalization to other observables is possible, providing an efficient approach to determine non-perturbatively renormalized fermionic observables like form factors or bag parameters from lattice simulations.",

As an entry point to these challenges, we address the simulation of SU(2) lattice gauge theory. Using qudit registers to encode the digitized gauge field, we provide quantum resource estimates, in terms of elementary qudit gates, for arbitrarily high local gauge field truncations. We then demonstrate an end-to-end simulation of real-time, qutrit-digitized SU(2) dynamics on a cube. Through optimizing the simulation, we improved circuit decompositions for uniformly-controlled qudit rotations, an algorithmic primitive for general applications of quantum computing. The decompositions also apply to mixed-dimensional qudit systems, which we found advantageous for compiling lattice gauge theory simulations. Furthermore, we parallelize the evolution of opposite faces in anticipation of similar opportunities arising in three-dimensional lattice volumes. This work details an ambitious executable for future qudit hardware and attests to the value of codesign strategies between lattice gauge theory simulation and quantum compilation.",

We access it reliably by using variationally optimized operators, use of which also improves the purity of the $J/ψ$ and $η$ signals, reducing systematic uncertainties. High quality results at a large number of kinematic points are obtained in a typically noisy disconnected process by using a novel correlator averaging procedure.

A transformation that relates the Butcher tableaux of the pairs is found and the fact that the c-reflected method satisfies the same order conditions as the original one is proven. Numerical evidence that validates the analytic results is presented. Branches of solutions for (5,4) methods, first explored by Carpenter and Kennedy, are constructed numerically. Four new (5,4) schemes with coefficients expressed in radicals and one with rational coefficients are examined for illustration. Eight new (6,4) schemes, some of which can be expressed in rationals or radicals, and one (8,4) scheme, are studied to understand the practical implications of the c-reflection symmetry for methods with higher number of stages. In the absence of closed-form analytic solutions for 2N-storage Runge-Kutta methods of order four and above, the general symmetry properties, as well as some specific analytic solutions presented here, may help in development and optimization of 2N-storage schemes.",

This provides a new framework for computing scattering observables in lattice formulations of strongly interacting theories, such as lattice quantum chromodynamics. In this paper, we prove that the proposal of real-time estimators of scattering observables is universally applicable to all scattering observables of gapped quantum field theories. All finite-volume errors are exponentially suppressed, and the rate of this suppression is controlled by the regulator considered, namely, a displacement of the spectrum of the theory into the complex plane. A partial restoration of Lorentz symmetry by averaging over different boosts gives an additional suppression of finite volume errors. Our results also apply to the simulation of wavepacket scattering, where a similar averaging is performed to construct the wavepackets that regulate the finite volume effects. We also comment on potential applications of our results to traditional computational schemes.",

      "summary": "We present results from co-designed quantum simulations of the neutrinoless double-$β$ decay of a simple nucleus in 1+1D quantum chromodynamics using IonQ's Forte-generation trapped-ion quantum computers. Electrons, neutrinos, and up and down quarks are distributed across two lattice sites and mapped to 32 qubits, with an additional 4 qubits used for flag-based error mitigation. A four-fermion interaction is used to implement weak interactions, and lepton-number violation is induced by a neutrino Majorana mass. Quantum circuits that prepare the initial nucleus and time evolve with the Hamiltonian containing the strong and weak interactions are executed on IonQ Forte Enterprise. A clear signal of neutrinoless double-$β$ decay is measured, making this the first quantum simulation to observe lepton-number violation in real time. This was made possible by co-designing the simulation to maximally utilize the all-to-all connectivity and native gate-set available on IonQ's quantum computers. Quantum circuit compilation techniques and co-designed error-mitigation methods, informed from executing benchmarking circuits with up to 2,356 two-qubit gates, enabled observables to be extracted with high precision. We discuss the potential of future quantum simulations to provide yocto-second resolution of the reaction pathways in these, and other, nuclear processes.",

      "summary": "The strong force which binds hadrons is described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Determining the character and manifestations of QCD is one of the most important and challenging outstanding issues necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the structure of hadrons. Within the context of the QCD parton picture, the parton distribution functions (PDFs) have been remarkably successful in describing a wide variety of processes. However, these PDFs have generally been confined to the description of collinear partons within the hadron. New experiments and facilities provide the opportunity to additionally explore the three-dimensional structure of hadrons, which can be described by generalized parton distributions (GPDs), for example. In recent years, a breakthrough was made in calculating the Bjorken-$x$ dependence of PDFs in lattice QCD by using large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) and other similar frameworks. The breakthrough has led to the emergence and rapid development of direct calculations of Bjorken-$x$--dependent structure. In this review article, we show some of the recent progress made in lattice QCD in PDFs and GPDs and discuss future challenges.",

      "summary": "Quantum simulators offer great potential for investigating dynamical properties of quantum field theories. However, preparing accurate non-trivial initial states for these simulations is challenging. Classical Euclidean-time Monte-Carlo methods provide a wealth of information about states of interest to quantum simulations. Thus, it is desirable to facilitate state preparation on quantum simulators using this information. To this end, we present a fully classical pipeline for generating efficient quantum circuits for preparing the ground state of an interacting scalar field theory in 1+1 dimensions. The first element of this pipeline is a variational ansatz family based on the stellar hierarchy for bosonic quantum systems. The second element of this pipeline is the classical moment-optimization procedure that augments the standard variational energy minimization by penalizing deviations in selected sets of ground-state correlation functions (i.e., moments). The values of ground-state moments are sourced from classical Euclidean methods. The resulting states yield comparable ground-state energy estimates but exhibit distinct correlations and local non-Gaussianity. The third element of this pipeline is translating the moment-optimized ansatz into an efficient quantum circuit with an asymptotic cost that is polynomial in system size. This work opens the way to systematically applying classically obtained knowledge of states to prepare accurate initial states in quantum field theories of interest in nature.",

The original formalism cannot be applied due to different divergent asymptotic behavior resulting from the long-range nature of the Coulomb force. We show that a modified formula in which the difference of integrated correlation functions between particles interacting with Coulomb plus short-range interaction and with Coulomb interaction alone is free of divergence, and has rapid approach to its infinite volume limit.

      "title": "The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in the Standard Model: an update",
      "summary": "We present the current Standard Model (SM) prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment, $a_μ$, updating the first White Paper (WP20) [1]. The pure QED and electroweak contributions have been further consolidated, while hadronic contributions continue to be responsible for the bulk of the uncertainty of the SM prediction. Significant progress has been achieved in the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution using both the data-driven dispersive approach as well as lattice-QCD calculations, leading to a reduction of the uncertainty by almost a factor of two. The most important development since WP20 is the change in the estimate of the leading-order hadronic-vacuum-polarization (LO HVP) contribution. A new measurement of the $e^+e^-\\toπ^+π^-$ cross section by CMD-3 has increased the tensions among data-driven dispersive evaluations of the LO HVP contribution to a level that makes it impossible to combine the results in a meaningful way. At the same time, the attainable precision of lattice-QCD calculations has increased substantially and allows for a consolidated lattice-QCD average of the LO HVP contribution with a precision of about 0.9%. Adopting the latter in this update has resulted in a major upward shift of the total SM prediction, which now reads $a_μ^\\text{SM} = 116\\,592\\,033(62)\\times 10^{-11}$ (530 ppb). When compared against the current experimental average based on the E821 experiment and runs 1-6 of E989 at Fermilab, one finds $a_μ^\\text{exp} - a_μ^\\text{SM} =38(63)\\times 10^{-11}$, which implies that there is no tension between the SM and experiment at the current level of precision. The final precision of E989 (127 ppb) is the target of future efforts by the Theory Initiative. The resolution of the tensions among data-driven dispersive evaluations of the LO HVP contribution will be a key element in this endeavor.",

The angular distributions of $c\\bar{c}$ in conventional charmonia are found to be in accordance with the expectation of two-body systems, while that of the $1^{-+}$ state exhibits an $S$-wave feature. However, the $c\\bar{c}$ radial distributions turn out to be strikingly different from the non-relativistic quark model and can be understood by the Dirac theory of two-body bound states. These results provide the first gauge invariant and model-independent three-dimensional portraits of charmonium(like) states.",

We prepare well-separated single-particle wave packets with desired momentum-space wavefunctions, and simulate their collision through digitized time evolution. Multiple hadronic wave packets can be produced using the efficient, systematically improvable algorithm of this work, achieving high fidelity with the target initial state. Specifically, employing a trapped-ion quantum computer (IonQ Forte), we prepare up to three meson wave packets using 11 and 27 system qubits, and simulate collision dynamics of two meson wave packets for the smaller system. Results for local observables are consistent with numerical simulations at early times, but decoherence effects limit evolution into long times. We demonstrate the critical role of high-fidelity initial states for precision measurements of state-sensitive observables, such as $S$-matrix elements. Our work establishes the potential of quantum computers in simulating hadron-scattering processes in strongly interacting gauge theories.",

      "summary": "We present the first lattice QCD calculations of the isovector helicity transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) and the flavor-dependent unpolarized TMDPDFs for up and down quarks in the proton. Our computations utilize domain-wall fermion discretization with physical quark masses. Employing Coulomb-gauge-fixed quark correlation functions within the large-momentum effective theory framework, we access nonperturbative transverse quark separations $b_T$ up to approximately 1 fm, corresponding to transverse momenta as low as 200 MeV. Based on the quasi-TMD factorization theorem, we construct renormalization-group-invariant ratios that are equal to the corresponding light-cone TMDPDF ratios. At moderate $x$, our results reveal that the isovector helicity and unpolarized TMDPDFs exhibit nearly identical transverse structure up to a normalization factor, and the unpolarized distributions display only mild flavor dependence. These findings not only support key trends observed in recent global analyses but also provide robust, nonperturbative constraints that can distinguish between different parameterizations. This work establishes a first-principles benchmark for TMDPDFs, offering valuable input for ongoing and future experimental efforts to map the proton's three-dimensional structure.",

      "summary": "Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide a framework for describing dynamical systems ranging from nuclei to materials. LGTs that host concatenated conservation laws can exhibit Hilbert space fragmentation, where each subspace may be labeled by a conserved quantity with nonlocal operator support. It is expected that nonlocal conservation laws will not impede thermalization locally. However, this expectation has recently been challenged by the notion of statistical localization, wherein particular motifs of microscopic configurations may remain frozen in time due to strong Hilbert space fragmentation. Here, we report the first experimental signatures of statistically-localized behavior. We realize a novel constrained LGT model using a facilitated Rydberg atom array, where atoms mediate the dynamics of electric charge clusters whose nonlocal pattern of net charges remains invariant. By experimentally reconstructing observables sampled from a temporal ensemble, we probe the spatial distribution of each conserved quantity. We find that as a result of strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the expectation values of all conserved quantities remain locally distributed in typical quantum states, even though they are described by nonlocal string-like operators. Our work opens the door to high-energy explorations of cluster dynamics and low-energy studies of strong zero modes that persist in infinite-temperature topological systems.",

      "summary": "We perform a lattice calculation of the correlators of two chromoelectric fields in the adjoint representation connected by adjoint Wilson lines at non-zero temperature. These correlators arise in the study of quarkonium dynamics and of adjoint heavy quark diffusion in deconfined matter. We work in SU(3) gauge theory using either gradient flow or multi-level algorithms for noise reduction, and discuss the renormalization of the correlators on the lattice. We find that a Casimir factor rescaling relates the adjoint correlators corresponding to the diffusion of an adjoint heavy quark and the octet-octet quarkonium transitions to the chromoelectric correlator in the fundamental representation describing the diffusion of a heavy quark.",

Instead of mapping the second quantization of the system Hamiltonian to qubit Pauli gates representation via the Jordan-Wigner transform, we propose to use the few-body Hamiltonian matrix under the statevector basis representation which is more economical on the required number of quantum registers. For a single-particle excitation state on a one-dimensional chain, $Γ$ qubits can simulate $N=2^Γ$ number of sites, in comparison to $N$ qubits for $N$ sites via the Jordan-Wigner approach. A two-band diatomic tight-binding model is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the statevector basis representation. Both one-particle and two-particle quantum circuits are constructed and some numerical tests on IBM hardware are presented.",

      "summary": "Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET) is a physics-guided systematic expansion to calculate light-cone parton distributions, including collinear (PDFs) and transverse-momentum-dependent ones, at any fixed momentum fraction $x$ within a range of $[x_{\\rm min}, x_{\\rm max}]$. It theoretically solves the ill-posed inverse problem that afflicts other theoretical approaches to collinear PDFs, such as short-distance factorizations. Recently, arXiv:2504.17706 [1] raised practical concerns about whether current or even future lattice data will have sufficient precision in the sub-asymptotic correlation region to support an error-controlled extrapolation -- and if not, whether it becomes an inverse problem where the relevant uncertainties cannot be properly quantified. While we agree that not all current lattice data have the desired precision to qualify for an asymptotic extrapolation, some calculations do, and more are expected in the future. We comment on the analysis and results in Ref. [1] and argue that a physics-based systematic extrapolation still provides the most reliable error estimates, even when the data quality is not ideal. In contrast, re-framing the long-distance asymptotic extrapolation as a data-driven-only inverse problem with ad hoc mathematical conditioning could lead to unnecessarily conservative errors.",

      "summary": "A modification to the setup algorithm for the multigrid preconditioner of Wilson fermions in lattice QCD is presented. A larger basis of test vectors than that used in conventional multigrid is calculated by the smoother and truncated by singular value decomposition on the chiral components of the test vectors. The truncated basis is used to form the prolongation and restriction matrices of the multigrid hierarchy. This modification of the setup method is demonstrated to increase the convergence of linear solvers on an anisotropic lattice with $m_π \\approx 239$ MeV from the Hadron Spectrum Collaboration and an isotropic lattice with $m_π \\approx 220$ MeV from the MILC Collaboration. The lattice volume dependence of the method is also examined. Increasing the number of test vectors improves speedup up to a point, but storing these vectors becomes impossible in limited memory resources such as GPUs. To address storage cost, we implement a \\emph{streaming} singular value decomposition of the basis of test vectors on the chiral components and demonstrate a decrease in the number of fine level iterations by a factor of 1.7 for $m_q \\approx m_{crit}$.",

We focus on the gluon operator which was demonstrated to have the best signal-to-noise in the previous attempt [1] in computing gluon PDFs using LaMET.

We demonstrate that with the proper Wilson coefficients in place, the counterterms for the renormalization are independent of the hadron and mass within statistical error. Using the resulting renormalization, we then compute the nucleon PDF using a HISQ ensemble generated by the MILC collaboration with $N_f=2+1+1$, $a \\approx 0.12$ fm, with valence pion masses of 310 and 690 MeV and two gauge link smearing techniques.

D 107, 074507 (2023), we showed that form factors for radiative leptonic decays of pseudoscalar mesons can be determined efficiently and with high precision from lattice QCD using the ``3d method,'' in which three-point functions are computed for all values of the current-insertion time and the time integral is performed at the data-analysis stage. Here, we demonstrate another benefit of the 3d method: the form factors can be extracted for any number of nonzero photon virtualites from the same three-point functions at no extra cost. We present results for the $D_s\\to\\ellνγ^*$ vector form factor as a function of photon energy and photon virtuality, for both positive and negative virtuality. In our analysis, we separately consider the two different time orderings and the different quark flavors in the electromagnetic current. We discuss in detail the behavior of the unwanted exponentials contributing to the three-point functions, as well as the choice of fit models and fit ranges used to remove them for various values of the virtuality. While positive photon virtuality is relevant for decays to multiple charged leptons, negative photon virtuality suppresses soft contributions and is of interest in QCD-factorization studies of the form factors.",

      "summary": "The calculation of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in lattice QCD was traditionally done by calculating matrix elements in the symmetric frame. Recent advancements have significantly reduced computational costs by calculating these matrix elements in the asymmetric frame, allowing us to choose the momentum transfer to be in either the initial or final states only. The theoretical methodology requires a new parametrization of the matrix element to obtain Lorentz-invariant amplitudes, which are then related to the GPDs. The formulation and implementation of this approach have already been established for the unpolarized and helicity GPDs. Building upon this idea, we extend this formulation to the four leading-twist quark transversity GPDs ($H_T$, $E_T$, $\\widetilde{H}_T$, $\\widetilde{E}_T$). We also present numerical results for zero skewness using an $N_f=2+1+1$ ensemble of twisted mass fermions with a clover improvement. The light quark masses employed in these calculations correspond to a pion mass of about 260 MeV. Furthermore, we include a comparison between the symmetric and asymmetric frame calculations to demonstrate frame independence of the Lorentz-invariant amplitudes. Analysis of the matrix elements in the asymmetric frame is performed at several values of the momentum transfer squared, $-t$, ranging from 0.17 GeV$^2$ to 2.29 GeV$^2$.",

      "summary": "We present a short summary for the calculations of the nucleon $\\textit{isovector}$ form factors, which are relevant to improving the accuracy of the current neutrino oscillation experiments. The calculations are carried out with two of three sets of the $2+1$ flavor lattice QCD configurations generated at the physical point in large spatial volumes by the PACS Collaboration. The two gauge configurations are generated with the six stout-smeared $O(a)$ improved Wilson quark action and Iwasaki gauge action at the lattice spacing of $0.09$ fm and $0.06$ fm. We summarize the results for three form factors as well as the nucleon axial-vector ($g_A$), induced pseudoscalar ($g_P^*$) and pion-nucleon ($g_{πNN}$) couplings. Although our couplings agree with the experimental data, a firm conclusion should be drawn only after a continuum limit extrapolation is taken. We investigate the partially conserved axial-vector current (PCAC) relation in the context of the nucleon correlation functions. The low-energy relations arising from the PCAC relation can be used to verify whether the lattice QCD data correctly reproduce the physics in the continuum within the statistical accuracy. It is demonstrated that our $\\textit{new analysis}$ reduces the systematic uncertainty for the induced pseudoscalar and pseudoscalar form factors to a greater extent than the $\\textit{traditional analysis}$, and the results offer a theoretical insight into the pion-pole dominance model. Finally, we examine the applicable $q^2$ region for the low-energy relations.",

      "summary": "The liquid-vapor transition is a classic example of a discontinuous (first-order) phase transition. Such transitions underlie many phenomena in cosmology, nuclear and particle physics, and condensed-matter physics. They give rise to long-lived metastable states, whose decay can be driven by either thermal or quantum fluctuations. Yet, direct experimental observations of how these states collapse into a stable phase remain elusive in the quantum regime. Here, we use a trapped-ion quantum simulator to observe the real-time dynamics of ``bubble nucleation'' induced by quantum fluctuations. Bubbles are localized domains of the stable phase which spontaneously form, or nucleate, and expand as the system is driven across a discontinuous quantum phase transition. Implementing a mixed-field Ising spin model with tunable and time-dependent interactions, we track the microscopic evolution of the metastable state as the Hamiltonian parameters are varied in time with various speeds, bringing the system out of equilibrium. Site-resolved measurements reveal the emergence and evolution of finite-size quantum bubbles, providing direct insight into the mechanism by which the metastable phase decays. We also identify nonequilibrium scaling behavior near the transition, consistent with a generalized Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Our results demonstrate the power of quantum simulators to probe out-of-equilibrium many-body physics, including quantum bubble nucleation, a key feature of discontinuous quantum phase transitions, with application to studies of matter formation in the early universe.",

In order to contrast many-flavors strongly interacting theories with QCD on a quantitative footing, we use Lattice Field Theory simulations. We focus on the study of the flavor-singlet spectrum in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels: this is an interesting probe of the dynamics of the strongly interacting sector, as reminded by the QCD case with the $f_0(500)$ ($σ$) and $η^\\prime$ mesons. The hierarchy of the spectrum of a strongly coupled new gauge sector of the Standard Model defines the potential reach of future colliders for new physics discoveries. In addition to a novel hierarchy with light scalars, introducing many light flavors at fixed number of colors can influence the dynamics of the lightest flavor-singlet pseudoscalar. We present a complete lattice study of both these flavor-singlet channels on high-statistics gauge ensembles generated by the LatKMI collaboration with 4, 8, and 12 copies of light mass-degenerate fermions. We also present other hadron masses on the lightest ensemble for $N_f=8$ generated by the LatKMI collaboration and discuss the chiral extrapolation of the spectrum in this particular theory. We contrast the results to $N_f=4$ simulations and previous results of $N_f=12$ simulations.",

      "title": "Method for high-precision determination of the nucleon axial structure using lattice QCD: Removing $πN$-state contamination",
      "summary": "We performed a precise calculation of physical quantities related to the axial structure of the nucleon using 2+1 flavor lattice QCD gauge configuration (PACS10 configuration) generated at the physical point with lattice volume larger than $(10\\;{\\mathrm{fm}})^4$ by the PACS Collaboration. The nucleon matrix element of the axial-vector current has two types of the nucleon form factors, the axial-vector ($F_A$) form factor and the induced pseudoscalar ($F_P$) form factor. Recently lattice QCD simulations have succeeded in reproducing the experimental value of the axial-vector coupling, $g_A$, determined from $F_A(q^2)$ at zero momentum transfer $q^2=0$, at a percent level of statistical accuracy. However, the $F_P$ form factor so far has not reproduced the experimental values well due to strong $πN$ excited-state contamination. Therefore, we proposed a simple subtraction method for removing the so-called leading $πN$-state contribution, and succeeded in reproducing the values obtained by two experiments of muon capture on the proton and pion electro-production for $F_P(q^2)$. The novel approach can also be applied to the nucleon pseudoscalar matrix element to determine the pseudoscalar ($G_P$) form factor with the help of the axial Ward-Takahashi identity. The resulting form factors, $F_P(q^2)$ and $G_P(q^2)$, are in good agreement with the prediction of the pion-pole dominance model. In the new analysis, the induced pseudoscalar coupling $g_P^\\ast$ and the pion-nucleon coupling $g_{πNN}$ can be evaluated with a few percent accuracy including systematic uncertainties using existing data calculated at two lattice spacings.",

These methods are the three-particle relativistic field theory (RFT) formalism, the two-body Lippmann-Schwinger (LS) equation with chiral effective field theory potentials, and the two-particle relativistic framework proposed by Baiao Raposo and Hansen (BRH approach). In a simplified single-channel setting, we derive the conditions under which the infinite-volume integral equations from the RFT and BRH approaches reduce to the LS form. We present numerical examples showing that differences between these methods can be largely removed by adjusting short-range couplings. We also address a number of technical issues in the RFT approach.",

      "summary": "We perform a high-statistics lattice QCD calculation of the low-energy two-nucleon scattering amplitudes. In order to address discrepancies in the literature, the calculation is performed at a heavy pion mass in the limit that the light quark masses are equal to the physical strange quark mass, $m_π= m_K \\simeq 714 $ MeV. Using a state-of-the-art momentum space method, we rule out the presence of a bound di-nucleon in both the isospin 0 (deuteron) and 1 (di-neutron) channels, in contrast with many previous results that made use of compact hexaquark creation operators. In order to diagnose the discrepancy, we add such hexaquark interpolating operators to our basis and find that they do not affect the determination of the two-nucleon finite volume spectrum, and thus they do not couple to deeply bound di-nucleons that are missed by the momentum-space operators. Further, we perform a high-statistics calculation of the HAL QCD potential on the same gauge ensembles and find qualitative agreement with our main results. We conclude that two-nucleons do not form bound states at heavy pion masses and that previous identification of deeply bound di-nucleons must have arisen from a misidentification of the spectrum from off-diagonal elements of a correlation function.",

      "summary": "High-energy particle collisions can convert energy into matter through the inelastic production of new particles. Quantum computers are an ideal platform for simulating the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of collisions and the formation of subsequent many-particle states. In this work, evidence for inelastic particle production is observed in one-dimensional Ising field theory using IBM's quantum computers. The scattering experiment is performed on 104 qubits of ibm_marrakesh and uses up to 5,589 two-qubit gates to access the post-collision dynamics. An outgoing heavy particle produced in the collision is identified from the skewness of the measured energy density. Integral to this computation is a new quantum algorithm for preparing the initial state (wavepackets) of a quantum field theory scattering simulation. This method efficiently prepares wavepackets by extending recent protocols for creating W states with mid-circuit measurement and feedforward. The required circuit depth is independent of wavepacket size and spatial dimension, representing a superexponential improvement over previous methods. Our wavepacket preparation algorithm can be applied to a wide range of lattice models and is demonstrated in one-dimensional Ising field theory, scalar field theory, the Schwinger model and two-dimensional Ising field theory.",

We show that, below the chiral crossover, these susceptibilities are well described by the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model if charmed hadrons not listed in tables of the Particle Data Group are included. However, the HRG description abruptly breaks down just above the chiral crossover. To understand this, we use a model for the charm pressure in which it is expressed as the sum of partial pressures from charmed baryons, charmed mesons, and charm quarks. We present continuum estimates of these partial pressures and find that, while the partial pressures of charmed mesons and baryons drop below their respective HRG predictions, the charm quark pressure becomes non-zero above the chiral crossover.",

While in Euclidean spacetime simulations, based on Monte Carlo sampling, the corresponding tadpole improvement leads to a constant rescaled value per gauge configuration, in Minkowski spacetime simulations it requires a state- and time-dependent update of the coefficients of operators involving link variables in the Hamiltonian. To demonstrate this effect, we present the results of numerical simulations of the time evolution of truncated SU(2) plaquette chains and honeycomb lattices in 2+1D, starting from excited states with regions of high energy density, and with and without entanglement.",

      "summary": "Fourier acceleration is a technique used in Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations to decrease the autocorrelation between subsequent field configurations in the generated ensemble. It has been shown, in the perturbative limit, to eliminate the problem of critical slowing down in a $φ^4$ theory (arXiv:1812.05281 [hep-lat]). As a result, there are several techniques that are being explored to generalize Fourier acceleration to work with non-Abelian gauge theories like QCD (arXiv:2112.04556 [hep-lat], arXiv:2108.05486 [hep-lat]). It is hoped that these methods will prove effective at overcoming the problem of critical slowing down, even in the non-perturbative limit. In our work, we show that Fourier acceleration can be applied effectively to a linear sigma model in the symmetry broken phase, leading to reduced autocorrelation and faster thermalization. We present an algorithm for estimating the optimal Fourier acceleration masses dynamically, based on the lattice data. In the future, we hope to explore the effectiveness of these techniques in the strongly-interacting case. Since our $φ^4$ theory is a linear chiral effective theory for QCD, this could be interesting for those who are seeking to generalize Fourier acceleration to QCD.",

      "summary": "One proposal to compute parton distributions from first principles is the large momentum effective theory (LaMET), which requires the Fourier transform of matrix elements computed non-perturbatively. Lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) provides calculations of these matrix elements over a finite range of Fourier harmonics that are often noisy or unreliable in the largest computed harmonics. It has been suggested that enforcing an exponential decay of the missing harmonics helps alleviate this issue. Using non-perturbative data, we show that the uncertainty introduced by this inverse problem in a realistic setup remains significant without very restrictive assumptions, and that the importance of the exact asymptotic behavior is minimal for values of $x$ where the framework is currently applicable. We show that the crux of the inverse problem lies in harmonics of the order of $λ=zP_z \\sim 5-15$, where the signal in the lattice data is often barely existent in current studies, and the asymptotic behavior is not firmly established. We stress the need for more sophisticated techniques to account for this inverse problem, whether in the LaMET or related frameworks like the short-distance factorization. We also address a misconception that, with available lattice methods, the LaMET framework allows a \"direct\" computation of the $x$-dependence, whereas the alternative short-distance factorization only gives access to moments or fits of the $x$-dependence.",

      "summary": "AI/ML informed Symbolic Regression is the next stage of scientific modeling. We utilize a highly customizable symbolic regression package ``PySR\" to model the $x$ and $t$ dependence of the flavor isovector combination $H_{u-d}(x,t,ξ)$ at $ξ=0$. These PySR models were trained on GPD results provided by both Lattice QCD and phenomenological sources GGL, GK, and VGG. We demonstrate, for the first time, the consistency and systematic convergence of Symbolic Regression by quantifying the disparate models through their Taylor expansion coefficients. In addition to PySR penalizing models with higher complexity and mean-squared error, we implement schemes that test specific physics hypotheses, including force-factorized $x$ and $t$ dependence and Regge behavior in PySR GPDs. We show that PySR can identify factorizing GPD sources based on their response to the Force-Factorized model. Knowing the precise behavior of the GPDs, and their uncertainties in a wide range in $x$ and $t$, crucially impacts our ability to concretely and quantitatively predict hadronic spatial distributions and their derived quantities.",

      "summary": "We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and enhance it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared, going substantially beyond the previously discovered spectral equivalence. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this enhanced infrared equivalence.",

      "summary": "We present a lattice-QCD determination of the vector and axial-vector form factors that describe the charm-baryon semileptonic decays $Ξ_c\\to Ξ\\ell^+ ν_\\ell$. The calculation uses a domain-wall action for the up, down, and strange quarks, and an anisotropic clover action for the charm quark. We use four ensembles of gauge-field configurations generated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations, with lattice spacings between 0.111 and 0.073 fm and pion masses ranging from 420 to 230 MeV. We present Standard-Model predictions for the decay rates and branching fractions of $Ξ_c^0\\to Ξ_c^-\\ell^+ ν_\\ell$ and $Ξ_c^+\\toΞ_c^0\\ell^+ ν_\\ell$ for $\\ell=e,μ$. In particular, we obtain $Γ(Ξ_c^0 \\to Ξ^- e^+ ν_e)/|V_{cs}|^2 = 0.2515(73)\\text{ ps}^{-1}$ and $\\mathcal{B}(Ξ_c^0 \\to Ξ^- e^+ ν_e) = 3.58(12)\\:\\%$.

      "summary": "We present the first lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the pion valence-quark transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). Using correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge (CG), we computed the quasi-TMD beam function for a pion with a mass of 300 MeV, a fine lattice spacing of $a = 0.06$ fm and multiple large momenta up to 3 GeV. The intrinsic soft functions in the CG approach are extracted from form factors with large momentum transfer, and as a byproduct, we also obtain the corresponding Collins-Soper (CS) kernel. Our determinations of both the soft function and the CS kernel agree with perturbation theory at small transverse separations ($b_\\perp$) between the quarks. At larger $b_\\perp$, the CS kernel remains consistent with recent results obtained using both CG and gauge-invariant TMD correlators in the literature. By combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) factorization of the quasi-TMD beam function and the soft function, we obtain $x$-dependent pion valence-quark TMDPDF for transverse separations $b_\\perp \\gtrsim 1$ fm. Interestingly, we find that the $b_\\perp$ dependence of the phenomenological parameterizations of TMDPDF for moderate values of $x$ are in reasonable agreement with our QCD determinations. In addition, we present results for the transverse-momentum-dependent wave function (TMDWF) for a heavier pion with 670 MeV mass.",

Such scattering processes and resonances can be determined in lattice QCD by first obtaining the finite-volume energy spectrum of stationary states involving meson-baryon and baryon-baryon systems. A well-known quantization condition involving the scattering $K$-matrix and a complicated ``box matrix'' also yields a finite-volume energy spectrum. By appropriately parametrizing the scattering $K$-matrix, the best fit values of the $K$-matrix parameters are those which produce a finite-volume spectrum which best matches that obtained from lattice QCD. The $Δ$ resonance, a recent study of the two-pole nature of scattering near the $Λ(1405)$, and $NN$ scattering in the $SU(3)$ flavor limit are highlighted.",

This result is based on a generalization of the $T'$-expansion scheme, thanks to which the diagonal $μ_B$ extrapolation was pushed up to a baryo-chemical potential $μ_B/T \\sim 3.5$ for the first time. This considerably extended the coverage of the Taylor expansion, limited to $μ_B/T < 2.5-3$. As a consequence, we are able to offer a substantially larger coverage of the four-dimensional QCD phase diagram as well, compared to previously available Taylor expansion results. Our results are based on new continuum estimated lattice results on the full set of second and fourth order fluctuations.",

Using gauge configurations of twisted-mass fermions, we obtain the correlation functions for 6 values of momentum for the kaon between 0 and 2GeV (both inclusive), we use statistical techniques such as jackknife resampling to derive the energy of the particle. The lattice results are compared to the continuum dispersion relation for the particle, to assess systematic uncertainties in the lattice data.

Thus, validating established results on current quantum computers is essential for evaluating their future utility. Hence, we investigate the entanglement entropy of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos, many-body physics, and holographic duality, in current IBM's superconducting quantum computers. We implement optimized swap-based many-body interference protocol and randomized measurement protocol tailored for IBM quantum computers' limited qubit connectivity. Additionally, we employ quantum multi-programming that parallelizes circuit execution to improve the results obtained by the randomized measurement protocol. Finally, by incorporating the quantum error mitigation techniques into our implementation of the entropy measurement protocols on IBM quantum hardware, we show that the current noisy quantum computer can yield results aligned with theoretical expectations, therefore affirming its capability to explore chaotic quantum dynamics in complex quantum systems.",

In this work, we note another coincidence: the Lanczos algorithm is equivalent to the well-known Rayleigh-Ritz method applied to Krylov subspaces. Rayleigh-Ritz provides optimal eigenvalue approximations within subspaces; we find that spurious-state filtering allows these optimality guarantees to be retained in the presence of statistical noise. We explore the relation between Lanczos and Prony's method, their block generalizations, generalized pencil of functions (GPOF), and methods based on the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP), and find they all fall into a larger \"Prony-Ritz equivalence class\", identified as all methods which solve a finite-dimensional spectrum exactly given sufficient correlation function (matrix) data. This equivalence allows simpler and more numerically stable implementations of (block) Lanczos analyses.",

      "summary": "Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories offer the potential to directly study the non-perturbative dynamics of quantum chromodynamics, but naive analyses suggest that they require large computational resources. Large $N_c$ expansions are performed to order 1/$N_c$ to simplify the Hamiltonian of pure SU($N_c$) lattice gauge theories. A reformulation of the electric basis is introduced with a truncation strategy based on the construction of local Krylov subspaces with plaquette operators. Numerical simulations show that these truncated Hamiltonians are consistent with traditional lattice calculations at relatively small couplings. It is shown that the computational resources required for quantum simulation of time evolution generated by these Hamiltonians is 17-19 orders of magnitude smaller than previous approaches.",

      "summary": "We study finite-volume (FV) corrections to determinations of $g_A$ via lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) using analytic results and numerical analysis. We observe that $SU(2)$ Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory does not provide an unambiguous prediction for the sign of the FV correction, which is not surprising when one also considers large-$N_c$ constraints on the axial couplings. We further show that non-monotonic FV corrections are naturally allowed when one considers either including explicit $Δ$-resonance degrees of freedom or one works to higher orders in the chiral expansion. We investigate the potential impact of these FV corrections with a precision study of $g_A$ using models of FV corrections that are monotonic and non-monotonic. Using lattice QCD data that is approximately at the 1% level of precision, we do not see significant evidence of non-monotonic corrections. Looking forward to the next phase of lattice QCD calculations, we estimate that calculations that are between the 0.1%-1%-level of precision may be sensitive to these FV artifacts. Finally, we present an update of the CalLat prediction of $g_A$ in the isospin limit with sub-percent precision, $g_A^{\\rm QCD} = 1.2674(96)$.",

This is motivated by the desire to identify lattices for quantum simulations that involve only 3-link vertices among the gauge field group spaces in order to reduce the complexity in applications of the plaquette operator. For the honeycomb lattice, we derive a classically ${\\cal O}(b^2)$-improved Hamiltonian, with $b$ being the lattice spacing. Tadpole improvement via the mean-field value of the plaquette operator is used to provide the corresponding quantum improvements. We have identified the (non-chiral) hyperhoneycomb as a candidate spatial tessellation for 3+1D quantum simulations of gauge theories, and determined the associated ${\\cal O}(b)$-improved Hamiltonian.",

We use a formulation of the theory that balances locality of the Hamiltonian and size of the gauge-invariant state space, and we classically pre-compute dictionaries of plaquette operator matrix elements for use in circuit construction. We build circuits for simulating time evolution on arbitrary lattice volumes, spanning circuits suitable for NISQ era hardware to future fault-tolerant devices. Relative to spin models, time evolution in lattice gauge theories involves more complex local unitaries, and the Hilbert space of all quantum registers may have large unphysical subspaces. Based on these features, we develop general, volume-scalable tools for optimizing circuit depth, including pruning and fusion algorithms for collections of large multi-controlled unitaries. We describe scalings of quantum resources needed to simulate larger circuits and some directions for future algorithmic development.",

      "summary": "We present lattice results for the flavor diagonal charges of the proton from the analysis of eight ensembles generated using 2+1+1-flavors of highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ) by the MILC collaboration. The calculation includes all the needed connected and disconnected contributions to nucleon three-point function. For extracting matrix elements using fits to the spectral decomposition of these correlation functions, two strategies to remove excited state contributions are employed and compared. To renormalize these charges, the 2+1-flavor mixing matrix is calculated in the RI-sMOM intermediate scheme on the lattice. The final results are presented in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme at scale 2GeV. The axial charges for the proton are $g_A^u = 0.781(25)$, $g_A^d = -0.440(39)$, and $g_A^s = -0.055(9)$; the tensor charges are $g_T^u = 0.782(28)$, $g_T^d = -0.195(16)$, and $g_T^s = -0.0016(12)$; and the scalar charges are $g_S^u = 9.39(88)$, $g_S^d = 8.84(93)$, and $g_S^s = 0.37(14)$. Results for the neutron are given by the $u \\leftrightarrow d$ interchange. Results for the sigma terms are $σ_{πN}|_{\\rm standard} = 42(6)~{\\rm MeV}$ from a \"standard\" analysis and $σ_{πN}|_{N π} = 61(6)~{\\rm MeV}$ from a \"$Nπ$\" analysis that includes the contributions of multihadron $Nπ$ excited states as motivated by chiral perturbation theory. Our preferred value $σ_{πN}|_{N π}$ is consistent with the phenomenological extraction from $π- N$ scattering data. The strangeness content of the proton, for which the \"standard\" analysis is appropriate, is $σ_{s}|_{\\rm standard} = 35(13)~{\\rm MeV}$.",

      "summary": "We review the recent construction \\cite{brower2024isingmodelmathbbs2} of the 2d Ising model on a triangulated sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$. Surprisingly, this led to a precise map of the lattice couplings to the target geometry in order to reach the conform field theory (CFT) in the continuum limit. For the integrable 2d Ising CFT, the map was found analytically \\cite{Brower_2023}. Here we conjecture how this might be generalized. The discrete geometry is implemented by the piecewise flat triangulation introduced by Regge in 1960 for the Einstein Hilbert action \\cite{Regge1961GeneralRW}. Then following our Ising example, we posit the existence of a smooth map of lattice couplings in affine parameters consistent with quantum correlators. A sequence of theoretical investigations and numerical simulations are recommended to test this conjecture. They begin with non-integrable CFT's -- the 2d $φ^4$ theory on $\\mathbb{S}^2$; the 3d Ising model on $\\mathbb{S}^3$ and $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{S}^2$; QED3 on $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{S}^{2} $ as an intermediate step to 4d non-Abelian lattice gauge theory on $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{S}^3$.",

      "summary": "Momentum conservation in the nucleon is examined in terms of continuous flow of the momentum current density (or in short, momentum flow), which receives contributions from both kinetic motion and interacting forces involving quarks and gluons. While quarks conduct momentum flow through their kinetic motion and the gluon scalar (anomaly) contributes via pure interactions, the gluon stress tensor has both effects. The quarks momentum flow encodes the information of the color-Lorentz force density on them, and the momentum conservation allows to trace its origin to the gluon tensor and anomaly (a ``negative pressure'' potential). From the state-of-the-art lattice calculations and experimental fits on the form factors of the QCD energy-momentum tensor, we exhibit pictures of the momentum flow and the color-Lorentz forces on the quarks in the nucleon. In particular, the anomaly contributes a critical attractive force with a strength similar to that of a heavy-quark confinement potential.",

Our analysis reveals a significant tension at the $ \\sim 5σ$ level ($ 4.6σ$ to $ 5.2σ$) between the Standard Model prediction and the experimental value of $ |\\varepsilon_K| $. The Standard Model prediction, informed by lattice QCD inputs, accounts for only approximately 65% of the experimental value, leaving a 35% discrepancy unexplained. Notably, this tension vanishes when using the inclusive determination of $ |V_{cb}| $, derived from heavy quark expansion. The discrepancy is therefore tied to the well-known tension between the exclusive and inclusive determinations of $ |V_{cb}| $. We further report results for $ |\\varepsilon_K| $ obtained using the Brod--Gorbahn--Stamou (BGS) method based on $ u\\text{--}t $ unitarity, which yields an even stronger discrepancy, in the range of $ 4.9σ$ to $ 5.5σ$, when combined with lattice QCD inputs.",

The effect of the curvature is captured by site-dependent couplings obtained from the AdS2 metric applied to a flat nearest neighbor spin chain. We show that this model with only local site-dependent nearest neighbor interactions is maximally chaotic, can be classified as a fast scrambler, and saturates the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) bound on chaos for a certain set of parameters, thus making this model one of the few if not the only example where such fast scrambling behavior has been seen without all-to-all or long-range interactions. Moreover, the modest resources needed to simulate this model make it an ideal test-bed for studying scrambling and chaos on quantum computers.",

We examine three (classically equivalent) definitions of a quantum system's internal energy under strong-coupling conditions.

In these processes, the first law of thermodynamics holds for each set of definitions by construction. However, we prove that only two sets obey the second law. We illustrate our findings using a simple spin model. Our results guide studies of thermodynamic quantities in strongly coupled quantum systems.",

Using the relativistic two- and three-body finite-volume formalism, we constrain the two and three-meson K matrices, including not only the leading $s$ wave, but also $p$ and $d$ waves. By solving the three-body integral equations, we determine, for the first time, the physical-point scattering amplitudes for $3π^+$, $3K^+$, $π^+π^+ K^+$ and $K^+ K^+ π^+$ systems. These are determined for total angular momentum $J^P=0^-$, $1^+$, and $2^-$. We also obtain accurate results for $2π^+$, $π^+ K^+$, and $2K^+$ phase shifts.

Currently, these form factors are being measured at JLab at momentum transfer up to $Q^2=18$ GeV$^2$ for the proton and up to 14 GeV$^2$ for the neutron. We report preliminary results of our lattice calculations of these form factors, including $G_E$ and $G_M$ nucleon form factors with momenta up to $Q^2=8$ GeV$^2$, pion masses down to the almost-physical $m_π$=170 MeV, several lattice spacings down to $a=0.073$ fm, and high $O(10^5)$ statistics. Specifically, we study individual form factors, the $G_E/G_M$ ratios, and flavor dependence of contributions to the form factors. We observe qualitative agreement of our ab initio theory calculations with experiment. Comparison of our calculations and upcoming JLab experimental results will be an important test of nonperturbative QCD methods in the almost-perturbative regime.",

      "summary": "We calculate the perturbative corrections in the strong coupling to the unpolarized quark transverse-momentum dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) operator within a background-field framework, extending the approach of Ref. [1]. We focus on ensuring gauge invariance, identifying two key components needed: a gauge-invariant TMDPDF operator with a transverse gauge link at spatial infinity, and accounting of the equations of motion (EoM) of the background fields. We go beyond next-to-leading order in strong coupling expansion, considering multiple interactions with the background field at all orders of strong coupling. By examining the interplay between quark and gluon contributions, we show that spurious singularities, proportional to EoM, can be misinterpreted as genuine divergences in QCD factorization unless properly identified and removed.",

We also obtain accurate results for maximal-isospin two-meson amplitudes, with those for $π^+ K^+$ and $2K^+$ being the first determinations at the physical point. Dense lattice spectra are obtained using the stochastic Laplacian-Heaviside method, and the analysis leading to scattering amplitudes is done using the relativistic finite-volume formalism. Results are compared to chiral perturbation theory and to phenomenological fits to experimental data, finding good agreement.",

      "summary": "Traditional $\\mathrm{SU}(N)$ lattice gauge theories (LGTs) can be formulated using an orthonormal basis constructed from the irreducible representations (irreps) $V_λ$ of the $\\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge symmetry. On a lattice, the elements of this basis are tensor networks comprising dimer tensors on the links labeled by a set of irreps $\\{λ_\\ell\\}$ and monomer tensors on sites labeled by $\\{λ_s\\}$. These tensors naturally define a local site Hilbert space, $\\mathcal{H}^g_s$, on which gauge transformations act. Gauss's law introduces an additional index $α_s = 1, 2, \\dots, \\mathcal{D}(\\mathcal{H}_s^g)$ that labels an orthonormal basis of the gauge-invariant subspace of $\\mathcal{H}^g_s$. This monomer-dimer tensor-network (MDTN) basis, $\\left| \\{λ_s\\},\\{λ_\\ell\\},\\{α_s\\}\\right\\rangle$, of the physical Hilbert space enables the construction of new qubit-regularized $\\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge theories that are free of sign problems while preserving key features of traditional LGTs. Here, we investigate finite-temperature confinement-deconfinement transitions in a simple qubit-regularized $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge theory in $d=2$ and $d=3$ spatial dimensions, formulated using the MDTN basis, and show that they reproduce the universal results of traditional LGTs at these transitions. Additionally, in $d=1$, we demonstrate using a plaquette chain that the string tension at zero temperature can be continuously tuned to zero by adjusting a model parameter that plays the role of the gauge coupling in traditional LGTs.",

The dependence on PDF parameterization is explored using the CT18As variant, incorporating the ATLAS 7 TeV precision $W,Z$ dataset and introducing more flexible parameters to allow strangeness asymmetry at the starting scale $Q_0$. The interplay between lattice input and collider inclusive jet datasets is examined by including the post-CT18 inclusive jet datasets from recent LHC measurements and/or removing all collider inclusive jet datasets. Finally, we demonstrate several phenomenological implications at the LHC, focusing on gluon-gluon parton luminosity and related processes, such as the production of a Higgs-like scalar, top-quark pairs, and their associated production with an additional jet, Higgs, or $Z$ boson.",

We search for the onset of a first order QCD transition on the phase diagram by following contours of constant entropy density from imaginary to real chemical potentials under conditions of strangeness neutrality. We scan the phase diagram and investigate whether these contours meet to determine the probability that the critical point is located in a certain region on the $T-μ_B$ plane. To achieve this we introduce a new, continuum extrapolated equation of state at zero density with improved precision using lattices with $N_τ=8,10,12,16$ timeslices, and supplement it with new data at imaginary chemical potential. The current precision allows us to exclude, at the $2σ$ level, the existence of a critical point at $μ_B < 450$~MeV.",

Noise-reduction techniques such as low-mode averaging have been applied successfully to determine the vector-vector correlator with high statistical precision in the long-distance regime, but display an unfavourable scaling in terms of numerical cost. This is particularly true for the mixed contribution in which one of the two quark propagators is described in terms of low modes. Here we report on an ongoing project aimed at investigating the potential of machine learning as a cost-effective tool to produce approximate estimates of the mixed contribution, which are then bias-corrected to produce an exact result. A second example concerns the determination of electromagnetic isospin-breaking corrections by combining the predictions from a trained model with a bias correction.",

Our numerical results suggest that FTE$^2$ can be partitioned into a component corresponding to transverse vibrations of the flux tube and an internal color entropy. Further, motivated by analytical (1+1)D calculations, and SU(2) (2+1)D Yang-Mills numerical results, we argued that the internal entropy takes the form $\\langle F\\rangle\\log(N_c)$, with $\\langle F\\rangle$ the number of times, on average, that the flux tube crossed a boundary between region $V$ and its complement. We extend here our FTE$^2$ study to consider different geometries of region $V$, varying the number of boundary crossings, and number of colors. Our preliminary results support the conjectured form of the internal entropy, albeit with noteworthy subtleties relating to the partial/full intersections of the flux tube with the region $V$.",

      "summary": "We report on a scale determination, scale setting, and determination of the strong coupling in the gradient flow scheme using the $N_f=2+1$ highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) ensembles generated by the HotQCD Collaboration for bare gauge couplings ranging from $β= 7.030$ to $8.400$. The gradient flow scales we obtain in this work are $\\sqrt{t_0} = 0.14229(98)$~fm and $w_0 = 0.17190(140)$~fm. Using the decay constants of the kaon and $η_s$, as well as the bottomonium mass splitting from the literature, we also calculate the potential scale $r_1$, obtaining $r_1 = 0.3072(22)$~fm. We fit the flow scales to an Allton-type ansatz as a function of $β$, providing a polynomial expression that allows for the prediction of lattice spacings at new $beta$ values. As a secondary result, we make an attempt to determine $Λ_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}$ and use it to estimate the strong coupling in the $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme.",

The three ensembles have lattice spacing $a$=0.08, 0.068, and 0.057 fm and approximately equal physical volume allowing for the continuum limit to be taken at the physical point. Excited-state contributions to the matrix elements are evaluated using several sink-source separations from 0.5 fm to 1.5 fm and multistate fits. We check the partially conserved axial-vector current (PCAC) hypothesis and the pion pole dominance (PPD) and show that in the continuum limit both relations are satisfied. We provide results at the continuum limit for the isovector nucleon axial charge, axial radius, pion-nucleon coupling constant, and for the induced pseudoscalar form factor at the muon capture point.",

      "summary": "A key search mode for axion-like particles (ALPs) that couple to charm quarks is $J/ψ\\to γa$. Here we calculate the form factor that allows the rate of this process to be determined using lattice QCD for the first time. Our calculations use the relativistic Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) action for the valence charm quarks on gluon field configurations generated by the MILC collaboration that include $u$, $d$, $s$ and $c$ HISQ quarks in the sea at four values of the lattice spacing and both unphysical and physical sea quark masses. We determine the form factor as a function of ALP mass with an uncertainty of less than 2\\% across our full range of ALP masses from zero up to 95\\% of the $J/ψ$ mass. This represents a substantial improvement in accuracy of the theoretical picture of this decay compared to the previously used tree-level and $\\mathcal{O}(α_s)$ perturbation theory. We use our form factor to determine constraints on ALP masses and couplings to charm quarks and photons in several different scenarios using recent experimental data from BESIII. Our calculation paves the way for further lattice QCD input on new physics constraints from radiative decays.",

      "summary": "To study quantum field theories on a quantum computer, we must begin with Hamiltonians defined on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space and then take appropriate limits. This approach can be seen as a new type of regularization for quantum field theories, which we refer to as qubit regularization. A related finite-dimensional regularization, known as the D-theory approach, was proposed long ago as a general framework for all quantum field theories. In this framework, the dimensionality of the local Hilbert space at each spatial point can increase as needed through an additional flavor index. To reproduce asymptotically free QFTs, most studies assume that qubit-regularized theories require extending the local Hilbert space to infinity. However, contrary to this common belief, recent discoveries in (1+1) dimensions have revealed two examples where asymptotic freedom appears to emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space through a novel renormalization group (RG) flow. These findings motivate further investigation into whether asymptotically free gauge theories could also emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space. To support these explorations, we propose an orthonormal basis called the monomer-dimer-tensor-network (MDTN) basis and use it to construct new types of qubit-regularized lattice gauge theories.",

      "summary": "The Field-Transformation Hybrid Monte-Carlo (FTHMC) algorithm potentially mitigates the issue of critical slowing down by combining the HMC with a field transformation, originally proposed by Lüscher and motivated as trivializing the theory. For the transformation, we use a single invertible discrete smearing step inspired by the Wilson flow but which resembles a Jacobian-computable generalisation of the stout smearing step. This is applied to a system with Iwasaki gauge fields and 2+1 Domain-Wall fermions. We have studied the effect of different smearing parameter values on autocorrelation times of Wilson-flowed energies with different flow time. We have found a reduction of exponential autocorrelation times for infra-red observables such as Wilson flowed energy densities and topological charge densities when a larger value of the smearing parameter is used. The autocorrelation times of local observables are computed using an approach akin to the master-field technique, allowing us to estimate the effect of the field transformation with different parameters based on a small number of configurations.",

A popular method to estimate the position of a singularity is to model the free energy as a rational function of the baryon chemical potential $μ_\\text{B}$. The parameters of this model can be constrained by the cumulants of the net baryon density taken at $μ_\\text{B}^2\\leq0$ .

Recent glueball studies in lattice QCD are then presented, and an exploratory investigation of the scalar glueball using glueball, meson, and meson-meson operators is summarized, suggesting that no scalar state below 2 GeV or so can be considered to be predominantly a glueball state.",

For short distances, the static energy can be calculated both on the lattice with the use of Wilson line correlators, and with the perturbation theory up to three loop accuracy with leading ultrasoft log resummation. Comparing the perturbative expression and lattice data allows for precise determination of $α_\\mathrm{s}(m_Z)$.

Our expression works under arbitrary affine transformation both on triangular and hexagonal lattices (where the former includes the rectangular lattices). The correctness of the operators is numerically confirmed in Monte Carlo calculations by comparing the results with the conformal Ward identity, including the operator normalization. In the derivation of the EM tensor, a staggered structure of the affine-transformed hexagonal lattice is analyzed, which shows a peculiar shift from the circumcenter dual lattice and appears as a mixing angle between the holomorphic part $T(z)$ and the antiholomorphic part $\\tilde T(\\bar z)$. The details of this contribution will appear in a subsequent paper.",

In this work, on behalf of the Lattice Strong Dynamics (LSD) Collaboration, we present our recent investigation on the finite temperature confinement transition of the one-flavor SU(4) dark gauge theory named Hyper Stealth Dark Matter (HSDM). The dark matter candidate in this theory is a composite bosonic baryon and can have a remarkably low mass of a few GeV. We expect the finite temperature transition to be first-order over at least in some finite range of fermionic masses and to be a potential source of observable gravitational radiation. The finite temperature simulation of one-flavor SU(4) is done by using Möbius Domain wall fermions. The order of the transition and its fermionic mass dependence are explored by monitoring the Polyakov loop, chiral condensate and topological charge using three lattice volumes at $N_t=8$.",

      "summary": "Typically, the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm employs mixed precision and even-odd preconditioning to compute propagators for highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ). This approach suffers from critical slowing down as the light quark mass is decreased to its physical value. Multigrid is one alternative to combat critical slowing down; however, it involves setup costs that are not always easy to amortize. We consider deflation, which can also remove critical slowing down, but incurs its own setup cost to compute eigenvectors. Results using the MILC and QUDA software libraries to generate eigenvectors and to perform deflated solves on lattices up to $144^3 \\times 288$ (with lattice spacing 0.04 fm) and with a range of quark masses from the physical strange down to the physical light quark values will be presented. We compare with CG and comment on deflation versus multigrid.",

      "summary": "Large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) provides an approach to directly calculate the $x$-dependence of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) on a Euclidean lattice through power expansion and a perturbative matching. When a parton's momentum becomes soft, the corresponding logarithms in the matching kernel become non-negligible at higher orders of perturbation theory, which requires a resummation. But the resummation for the off-forward matrix elements at nonzero skewness $ξ$ is difficult due to their multi-scale nature. In this work, we demonstrate that these logarithms are important only in the threshold limit, and derive the threshold factorization formula for the quasi-GPDs in LaMET. We then propose an approach to resum all the large logarithms based on the threshold factorization, which is implemented on a GPD model. We demonstrate that the LaMET prediction is reliable for $[-1+x_0,-ξ-x_0]\\cup[-ξ+x_0,ξ-x_0]\\cup[ξ+x_0,1-x_0]$, where $x_0$ is a cutoff depending on hard parton momenta. Through our numerical tests with the GPD model, we demonstrate that our method is self-consistent and that the inverse matching does not spread the nonperturbative effects or power corrections to the perturbatively calculable regions.",

      "summary": "Tensor-network methods enable probing dynamics of strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, including gauge theories, via Hamiltonian simulation, hence bypassing sign problems. They also have the potential to inform efficient quantum-simulation algorithms of the same theories. We develop and benchmark a matrix-product-state ansatz for the SU(2) lattice gauge theory using the loop-string-hadron formulation. This formulation has been demonstrated to be advantageous in Hamiltonian simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories. It is applicable to both SU(2) and SU(3) gauge groups, to periodic and open boundary conditions, and to 1+1 and higher dimensions. In this work, we report on progress in computing static and dynamical observables in a SU(2) gauge theory in (1+1)D, pushing the boundary of existing studies.",

We use seven different RBC/UKQCD ensembles with pion masses ranging from a near-physical 139 MeV up to 431 MeV. We consider two different analysis types, with or without two-meson operators at the source. We observe the expected below-threshold ground states. The fits without the two-meson operators appear to be more stable, but may overestimate the ground-state energies, while preliminary fits with two-meson operators at the source only appear to underestimate the ground-state energies.",

Simulations were performed on $N_t=12$ lattices with aspect ratios ranging from 2 to 4 for various quark masses, at a lattice spacing of $a=0.1361(20)$ fm, corresponding to a temperature of 121(2) MeV. To clarify the nature of the phase transition, a large-volume lattice, $48^3 \\times 12\\times 16$, was added to analyze the volume dependence of disconnected chiral susceptibility. By examining the chiral condensate, disconnected chiral susceptibility, and Binder cumulant, and incorporating results from $24^3 \\times 12 \\times 16$ and $36^3 \\times 12 \\times 16$ lattices reported in earlier studies, we observe that the transition is consistent with a crossover at a quark mass of approximately $m_f^{\\mathrm{\\overline {MS}}}(2\\, \\mathrm{GeV}) \\sim 4$ MeV at this temperature. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of residual chiral symmetry breaking on the chiral condensate and disconnected chiral susceptibility for different sizes in the 5th direction.",

      "summary": "In the PACS10 project, the PACS collaboration has generated three sets of the PACS10 gauge configurations at the physical point with lattice volume larger than $(10\\;{\\rm fm})^4$ and three different lattice spacings. The isovector nucleon form factors had been already calculated by using two sets of the PACS10 gauge configurations. In our strategy, the smearing parameters of the nucleon interpolation operator were highly optimized to eliminate as much as possible the contribution of excited states in the nucleon two-point function. This strategy was quite successful in calculations of the electric ($G_E$), magnetic ($G_M$) and axial-vector ($F_A$) form factors, while the induced pseudoscalar ($F_P$) and pseudoscalar ($G_P$) form factors remained strongly affected by residual contamination of $πN$-state contribution. In this work, we propose a simple method to remove the $πN$-state contamination from the $F_P$ form factor, and then evaluate the induced pseudoscalar charge $g_P^\\ast$ and the pion-nucleon coupling $g_{πNN}$ from existing data in a new analysis. Applying this method to the $G_P$ form factor is also considered with a help of the axial Ward-Takahashi identity.",

      "summary": "The temperature dependence of bottomonium correlators up to the 3S and 3P excited states are presented in the range $T \\simeq 133-250$ MeV. These lattice calculations employ the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) approach for bottom quarks on (2+1)-flavor gauge backgrounds, using the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action near the physical point. The study utilizes a fine lattice spacing of 0.0493 fm at all temperatures. Extended bottomonium operators are implemented to achieve optimized overlaps with the targeted excited states, enhancing sensitivity to thermal effects. To probe in-medium modifications of excited bottomonia, we extract thermal widths and in-medium masses from bottomonium correlators, parameterizing the spectral function with a Gaussian ansatz. Our results confirm nonzero thermal widths for various bottomonium states as the temperature increases, while no significant mass shifts are observed. Additionally, we check that the in-medium properties of bottomonia are almost not affected by variations in the choice of extended operators.",

We argue that the presence of these non-trivial commutation relations implies the existence of lattice 't Hooft anomalies. From the shifts we also construct a set of conserved, quantized charges that generate continuous symmetries of the lattice theory.

      "summary": "In lattice field theory, field sparsening aims to replace quantum fields, or objects constructed from them, with approximations that preserve the appropriate symmetries and maintain many aspects of the physics that the fields determine. For example, an effective sparsening of a quark propagator provides an efficient map from a quark propagator on a fine lattice geometry to a quark propagator defined on a coarser geometry in order to reduce storage and computational costs of subsequent calculational stages while maintaining long-distance correlations and corresponding low-energy physical information. Previous studies have focused on decimating lattice sites or randomly sampling lattice sites to reduce the size of the propagator and subsequent costs of Wick contractions. Here, we extend the study of sparsening to incorporate covariant averaging of spatial sites and examine the effects on two-point and three-point correlation functions involving various hadrons. We find that sparsening is most effective in reproducing the unsparsened versions of these correlation functions when weighted covariant-averaging is sequentially applied many times.",

In this work, we determine an important contribution to the latter from a diagram comprised of two two-point quark-loops, connected by the internal photon and gluons. This ultraviolet-finite correction is calculated from lattice QCD using a coordinate-space formalism, where photons are treated in the continuum and infinite volume. Our result amounts to a $(-0.89\\pm 0.18)\\%$ correction to the leading-order HVP contribution to $(g-2)_μ$. To overcome the worsening statistical noise at large distances, our analysis is combined with phenomenological models featuring light pseudoscalar mesons with masses below 1 GeV. In particular, our data show a very steep mass dependence as dictated by the charged pion loop. Similarly, the other diagrams appearing in the O$(α)$-corrections to the HVP with the internal photon connecting two separate quark loops are also ultraviolet-finite and can be computed with the same formalism.",

We show that, at and below the chiral crossover temperature, these partial pressures receive enhanced contributions from experimentally unobserved charmed hadrons predicted by the Quark Model. Additionally, we demonstrate that at the chiral crossover, the Hadron Resonance Gas description breaks down, signaling the modification of open charm hadrons and thereby implying the onset of charm deconfinement. We present evidence for the survival of low-lying non-radial $1S$ and $1P$ hadron-like excitations above the chiral crossover, which hints at the sequential melting of charmed hadrons. Finally, we investigate the continuum partial pressure contribution of charm quark-like excitation that emerges at the chiral crossover and calculate its temperature-dependent in-medium mass.",

This requires a nonperturbative QCD calculation of the $B \\to ρ$ form factors $V$, $A_0$, $A_1$, and $A_{12}$. The unstable nature of the $ρ$ resonance has prevented precise lattice QCD calculations of these form factors to date. Here, we present the first lattice QCD calculation of the $B \\to ρ$ form factors in which the $ρ$ is treated properly as a resonance in $P$-wave $ππ$ scattering. To this end, we use the Lellouch-Lüscher finite-volume formalism to compute the $B \\to ππ$ form factors as a function of both momentum transfer and $ππ$ invariant mass, and then analytically continue to the $ρ$ resonance pole. This calculation is performed with $2+1$ dynamical quark flavors at a pion mass of approximately 320 MeV, and demonstrates a clear path toward results at the physical point.",

      "title": "Kinematically-enhanced interpolating operators for boosted hadrons",
      "summary": "We propose to use interpolating operators for lattice quantum chromodyanmics (QCD) calculations of highly-boosted pions and nucleons with kinematically-enhanced ground-state overlap factors at large momentum. Because this kinematic enhancement applies to the signal but not the variance of the correlation function, these interpolating operators can achieve better signal-to-noise ratios at large momentum. We perform proof-of-principle calculations with boosted pions and nucleons using close-to-physical and larger quark masses to explore the utility of our proposal. Results for effective energies and matrix elements, as well as Lanczos ground-state energy estimators, are consistent with theoretical expectations for signal-to-noise improvement at large momenta.",
